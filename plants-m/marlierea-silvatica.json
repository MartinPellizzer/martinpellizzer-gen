    "intro": "Marlierea silvatica, commonly known as the forest marlierea, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Marlierea silvatica is often found in shaded, moist forest understories, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
