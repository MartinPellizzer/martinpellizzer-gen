    "intro": "Monardella villosa subsp. franciscana, commonly known as Franciscan monardella, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of Northern California. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and clusters of showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in open woodlands. It is a member of the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is known for its aromatic leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
