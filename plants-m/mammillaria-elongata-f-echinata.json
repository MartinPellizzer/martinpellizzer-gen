The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by pale green fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
