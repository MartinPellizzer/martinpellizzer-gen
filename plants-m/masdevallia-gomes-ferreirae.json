It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, often colorful flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its humid, shaded habitat. Its foliage consists of narrow, strap-like leaves that help it conserve moisture in its native environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
