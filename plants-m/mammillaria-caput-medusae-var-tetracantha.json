    "intro": "Mammillaria caput-medusae var. tetracantha, commonly known as the four-spined hedgehog cactus, is a compact, spherical cactus native to Mexico. It features a dense covering of white to pale green glochids, which are barbed bristles that can cause irritation. The plant has short, cylindrical ribs that are often adorned with small, spiny tubercles. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a striking contrast to its textured appearance. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts."
