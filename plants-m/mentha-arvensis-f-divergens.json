    "intro": "Mentha arvensis f. divergens, commonly known as the field mint or narrow-leaved mint, is a variant of the broadleaf mint species. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and a strong, minty aroma. This plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, fields, and along roadsides. Its flowering stems bear small, tubular flowers that are usually purple or pink in color. Mentha arvensis f. divergens is a perennial herb that can spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in agricultural and natural areas."
