    "intro": "Mimosa involucrata, commonly known as the velvetleaf mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spherical heads, which are often mistaken for fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Mimosa involucrata is also known for its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively, making it a potential weed in some regions."
