    "intro": "Musa \u00d7 sapientum var. cinerea, commonly known as the black banana, is a variety of the common banana plant characterized by its dark purple to black peel. This variety is typically smaller than the standard banana and has a sweet, creamy texture when ripe. The leaves are large, broad, and have a waxy surface, typical of the Musa genus. It is native to Southeast Asia and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique appearance. While not as widely consumed as the Cavendish banana, it is valued in certain culinary and horticultural contexts."
