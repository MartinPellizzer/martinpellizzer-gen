    "intro": "Micromyrtus hymenonema, commonly known as the coastal paperbark, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a reddish inner layer, and its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to salt-laden coastal environments, making it a hardy and resilient species. Micromyrtus hymenonema is often used in coastal landscaping due to its ornamental value and ability to withstand harsh maritime conditions."
