    "intro": "Mariscus chaetophyllus, commonly known as the hairy leaf mariscus, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its fibrous roots make it drought-tolerant, and it is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
