    "intro": "Muhlenbergia orophila, commonly known as the Sierra grass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in high elevation environments such as mountain slopes and ridges. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that adds visual interest to its natural habitat. Muhlenbergia orophila is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid and semi-arid regions."
