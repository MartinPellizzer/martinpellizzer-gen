    "intro": "Minuartia oreina, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and tiny, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in crevices or on rock surfaces. It is adapted to harsh conditions, including high altitude and limited nutrient availability. Minuartia oreina is an important component of alpine ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
