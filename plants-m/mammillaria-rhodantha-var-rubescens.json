    "intro": "Mammillaria rhodantha var. rubescens, commonly known as the Ruby Mammillaria, is a compact cactus native to Mexico. It features short, cylindrical stems covered in white to pale blue spines and small, rounded tubercles. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect sunlight. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for succulent collections."
