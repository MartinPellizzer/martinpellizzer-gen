It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems and small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with thick leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. It blooms during the cooler months, typically in spring or autumn, and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Mesembryanthemum coruscans is also known for its ability to thrive in well-drained soil and full sun."
