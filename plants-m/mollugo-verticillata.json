    "intro": "Mollugo verticillata, commonly known as the carpetweed, is a low-growing annual plant native to temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It features prostrate stems that produce numerous small, greenish-white flowers arranged in whorls along the stem. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are opposite and often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in lawns, gardens, and along pathways. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it both a common weed and a resilient species in various habitats."
