    "intro": "Mammillaria haageana subsp. san-angelensis, commonly known as the San Angel milk barrel cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular or cylindrical stem with white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
