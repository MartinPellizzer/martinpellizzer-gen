    "intro": "Mentha longifolia var. dobrogensis, commonly known as Dobrogian mint, is a rare variant of the longleaf mint species. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers arranged in whorled clusters, typical of the Mentha genus. It is native to specific regions in Eastern Europe, particularly in the Dobruja area, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant and potentially endangered species."
