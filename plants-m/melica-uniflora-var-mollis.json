    "intro": "Melica uniflora var. mollis, commonly known as silky meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its delicate appearance and ecological role in stabilizing soil make it an important plant in wetland ecosystems."
