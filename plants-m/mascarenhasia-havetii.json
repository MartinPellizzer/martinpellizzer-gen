    "intro": "Mascarenhasia havetii, commonly known as the Mascarene lily, is a rare and endemic plant native to the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean. It is a herbaceous perennial with striking, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant has narrow, strap-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the unique microclimates of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
