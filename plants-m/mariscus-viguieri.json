    "intro": "Mariscus viguieri, commonly known as the Viguier's mariscus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in cool, humid climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected natural reserves. Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and conservation studies."
