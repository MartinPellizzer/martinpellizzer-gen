    "intro": "Mariscus roxburghianus, commonly known as the Himalayan snowbell, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of the Himalayas. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant produces bell-shaped flowers that are white or pale blue, often appearing in clusters during the spring. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture adapted to the harsh mountain climate. Mariscus roxburghianus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate regions."
