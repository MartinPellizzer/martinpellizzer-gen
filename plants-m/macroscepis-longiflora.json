It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces elongated, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
