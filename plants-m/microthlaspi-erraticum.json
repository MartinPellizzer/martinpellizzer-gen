    "intro": "Microthlaspi erraticum, commonly known as the erratic rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are basal, linear, and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Microthlaspi erraticum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a wildflower in suitable climates."
