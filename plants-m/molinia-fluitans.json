    "intro": "Molinia fluitans, commonly known as floating moor grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant that thrives in wetland environments. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that often float on the surface of water. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is typically found in marshes, pond margins, and other moist habitats across Europe and parts of Asia. Molinia fluitans plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
