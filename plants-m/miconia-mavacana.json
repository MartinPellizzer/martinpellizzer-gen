    "intro": "Miconia mavacana, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces showy, pale yellow to white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia mavacana is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
