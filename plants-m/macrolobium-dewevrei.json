    "intro": "Macrolobium dewevrei, commonly known as the African giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in diameter, providing a unique habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant has a thick, waxy cuticle on its leaves, which helps it float and resist water loss. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in the early morning and closing by midday. Macrolobium dewevrei plays an important ecological role in its native wetlands by supporting biodiversity and contributing to water filtration."
