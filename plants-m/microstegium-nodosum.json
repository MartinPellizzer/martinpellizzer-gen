    "intro": "Microstegium nodosum, commonly known as nodding woodoak, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a rough texture, and it produces distinctive nodding inflorescences. Microstegium nodosum plays a role in supporting local insect populations and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
