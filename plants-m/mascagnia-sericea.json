    "intro": "Mascagnia sericea, commonly known as the silverleaf mignonette, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring slender, silver-gray stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in a silvery-white coating, which gives it its common name. Mascagnia sericea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
