    "intro": "Marcetia carinata, commonly known as the hairy papyrus, is a herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of southern Africa. It features slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine, hairy hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, typically emerging from the base of the plant. Marcetia carinata is adapted to moist environments and plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils."
