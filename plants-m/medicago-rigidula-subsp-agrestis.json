It is characterized by its upright growth habit, trifoliate leaves, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. As a legume, it has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
