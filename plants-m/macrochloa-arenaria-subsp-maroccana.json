    "intro": "Macrochloa arenaria subsp. maroccana, commonly known as the Moroccan sand reed, is a perennial grass native to arid regions of North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh, dry conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or semi-arid environments. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control in dry climates."
