    "intro": "Melaleuca perforata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels away in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bottle-shaped flowers that are typically pale yellow to cream in color, which appear in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly serrated edge, and are arranged alternately along the stems. Melaleuca perforata is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in coastal and sandy areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
