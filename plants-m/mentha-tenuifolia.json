    "intro": "Mentha tenuifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its aromatic, slightly minty scent. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in whorls along the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial shade to full sun. Mentha tenuifolia is often used in herbal teas and traditional medicine for its purported digestive and calming properties."
