    "intro": "Macrolenes nemorosa var. verrucosa, commonly known as the roughleaf macrolene, is a variant of the macrolene species native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, rough-textured leaves that are often covered in small, raised bumps or warts. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually appearing in late spring to early summer. The botanical features of this variant make it a unique subject for study in plant morphology and ecological adaptation."
