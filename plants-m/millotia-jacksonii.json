    "intro": "Millotia jacksonii, commonly known as Jackson's millotia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and has lance-shaped leaves with a glossy surface. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Millotia jacksonii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
