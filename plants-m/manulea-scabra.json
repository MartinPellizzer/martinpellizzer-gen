It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is typically found in shrubland or rocky habitats. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
