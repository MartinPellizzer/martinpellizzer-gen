    "intro": "Moquiniastrum sordidum, commonly known as the muddy marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets. Its root system helps stabilize soil in wetland environments, contributing to ecosystem health. Moquiniastrum sordidum is adapted to tolerate periodic flooding and poor nutrient conditions."
