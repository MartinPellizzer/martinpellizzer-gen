    "intro": "Mentha aquatica var. lupulina, commonly known as water mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist or aquatic environments such as marshes, stream sides, and wet meadows. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often square in cross-section, a characteristic feature of the mint family. Its leaves are lance-shaped, serrated, and emit a strong, minty fragrance when crushed. The flowers are small, tubular, and typically pink or purple, arranged in whorls along the stem."
