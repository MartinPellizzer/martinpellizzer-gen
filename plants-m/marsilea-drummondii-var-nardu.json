    "intro": "Marsilea drummondii var. nardu, commonly known as the water clover, is a small aquatic fern that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. It is characterized by its four-leaf clover-like structure, with each leaflet being oval and slightly notched. The plant typically floats on the water surface, with its roots anchoring it to the substrate below. It produces small, greenish flowers that are often submerged, followed by the development of spore-producing structures called sporangia. This variety is native to North America and is often found in ponds, ditches, and wetlands."
