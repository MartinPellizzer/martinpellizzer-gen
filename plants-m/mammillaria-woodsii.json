    "intro": "Mammillaria woodsii, commonly known as the desert rose or woodsii hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a spiny, segmented stem that often develops a pinkish or reddish hue when exposed to full sun. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on short, erect pedicels. Mammillaria woodsii is well adapted to arid environments, with a shallow root system and a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation due to its compact size and ornamental appearance."
