    "intro": "Megalastrum sparsipilosum, commonly known as the sparsely hairy megalastrum, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Ericaceae. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and features small, elliptical leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white to pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
