    "intro": "Miconia aspergillaris, commonly known as the rough-leaved miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are rough to the touch due to dense pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Miconia aspergillaris is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions."
