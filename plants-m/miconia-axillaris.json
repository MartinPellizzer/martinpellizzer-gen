    "intro": "Miconia axillaris, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia axillaris is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
