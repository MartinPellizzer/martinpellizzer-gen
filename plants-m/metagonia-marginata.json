    "intro": "Metagonia marginata, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, where it thrives in sandy or saline soils. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Metagonia marginata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand harsh coastal conditions."
