It is a herbaceous perennial that produces striking, tubular flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves and is adapted to arid conditions, showcasing succulent stems that store water. Its flowers are typically pink or red, with a strong, aromatic scent. Mirabilis cedrosensis is considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss and limited geographic distribution."
