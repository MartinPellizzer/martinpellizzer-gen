    "intro": "Malus sylvestris var. apetala, commonly known as the apple tree with no petals, is a rare variant of the common apple tree. It is characterized by its lack of showy petals, which is unusual in the genus Malus. The plant typically produces small, apple-like fruits that are edible but often less flavorful than those of the standard species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and genetic traits."
