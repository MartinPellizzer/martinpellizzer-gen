    "intro": "Marrubium remotum, commonly known as the remote horehound, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and small, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid habitats, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments. Its medicinal properties have been historically recognized, though it is less commonly cultivated than other horehound species. The plant's structure and growth patterns reflect its evolutionary adaptations to survive in nutrient-poor soils."
