    "intro": "Muraltia cynara, commonly known as the white coral tree, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Africa. It features dense, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in spring. These flowers are followed by small, round, red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Muraltia cynara is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in coastal and sandy soils."
