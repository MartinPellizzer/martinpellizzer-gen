    "intro": "Megasea ciliata, commonly known as the coastal ciliate, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, opposite leaves with finely toothed margins. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its root system is adapted to tolerate saline and waterlogged soils, making it a common species in tidal areas. Megasea ciliata plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
