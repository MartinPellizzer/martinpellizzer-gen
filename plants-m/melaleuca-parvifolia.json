    "intro": "Melaleuca parvifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels off in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom from late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slight blue-gray hue, and are arranged alternately along the stems. Melaleuca parvifolia is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
