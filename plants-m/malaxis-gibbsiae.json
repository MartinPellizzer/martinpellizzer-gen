    "intro": "Malaxis gibbsiae, commonly known as the Gibbs' Malaxis, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wet tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a raceme, often with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found in primary rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
