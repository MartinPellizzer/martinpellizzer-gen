It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, round berries. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, and it is often used in traditional medicine by indigenous peoples. Micromeria pusilla plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
