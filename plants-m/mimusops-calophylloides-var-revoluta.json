    "intro": "Mimusops calophylloides var. revoluta, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged opposite each other on the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are often fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the tree is valued for its hard, durable wood used in furniture and construction. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate."
