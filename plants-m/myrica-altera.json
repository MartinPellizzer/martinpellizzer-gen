It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into dark blue berries, which are an important food source for wildlife. Myrica altera thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its aromatic foliage and adaptability make it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects."
