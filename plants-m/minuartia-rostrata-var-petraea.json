    "intro": "Minuartia rostrata var. petraea, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This variety is often found in mountainous areas and is valued for its resilience and ornamental appeal in rock gardens."
