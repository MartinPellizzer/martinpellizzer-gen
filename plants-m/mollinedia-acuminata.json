It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, with five petals and a prominent central corolla. Its milky sap, which is toxic, is a notable botanical feature. Mollinedia acuminata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks."
