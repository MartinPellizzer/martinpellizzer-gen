    "intro": "Megalastrum rupicola, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
