    "intro": "Muhlenbergia aguascalientensis, commonly known as the Mexican muhlenbergia, is a grass species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, bluish-green blades that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear narrow, awned lemmas, typical of the Paniceae tribe. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in dryland gardens."
