    "intro": "Modecca gummifera, commonly known as the gum tree, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its thick, bark-like trunk that exudes a sticky, resinous substance, which is the source of its common name. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy texture, while its flowers are clustered and typically have five petals. Modecca gummifera is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and animals."
