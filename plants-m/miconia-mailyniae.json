    "intro": "Miconia mailyniae, commonly known as the Hawaiian miconia, is a member of the Melastomataceae family. It is a shrub or small tree native to the Hawaiian Islands, characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mesic to wet forest habitats. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions."
