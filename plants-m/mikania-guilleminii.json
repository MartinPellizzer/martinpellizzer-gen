    "intro": "Mikania guilleminii, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a vigorous, herbaceous vine native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits. It spreads rapidly through both seeds and rhizomes, making it an invasive species in many regions. Its rapid growth and ability to climb various structures contribute to its ecological impact."
