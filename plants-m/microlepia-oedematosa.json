    "intro": "Microlepia oedematosa, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the water. Microlepia oedematosa plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
