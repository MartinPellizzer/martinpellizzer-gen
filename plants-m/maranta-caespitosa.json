    "intro": "Maranta caespitosa, commonly known as the upright arrowroot, is a herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive, arrow-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green, followed by the development of its starchy, tuberous roots. These roots are the primary botanical feature, valued for their high starch content and used in various culinary applications. Maranta caespitosa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests."
