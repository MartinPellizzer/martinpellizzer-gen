    "intro": "Melaleuca axillaris, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled pattern of white and grey beneath. The plant produces small, bottle-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, which appear in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine, silky hair. Melaleuca axillaris is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
