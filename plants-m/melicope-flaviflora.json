It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its aromatic, often fragrant leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits that are typically green when mature. Its leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, and the bark is often smooth and pale in color.
