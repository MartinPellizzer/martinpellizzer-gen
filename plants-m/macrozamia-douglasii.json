    "intro": "Macrozamia douglasii, commonly known as the Douglas cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the coastal regions of southeastern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces both male and female cones, with the female cones being particularly striking due to their elongated, spiny structure. It thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and wind exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
