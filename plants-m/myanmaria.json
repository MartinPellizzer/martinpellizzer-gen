It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained soil. Myanmaria is noted for its compact size and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
