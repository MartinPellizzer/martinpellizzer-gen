    "intro": "Miconia pernettifolia, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces showy, yellowish-white inflorescences that are clustered in terminal panicles. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic weed in some regions."
