    "intro": "Mimosa scutifera, commonly known as the sensitive plant or velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub native to the Americas. It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters. Its stems are often covered in a soft, velvety coating, giving it its common name. Mimosa scutifera is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of tropical and subtropical environments."
