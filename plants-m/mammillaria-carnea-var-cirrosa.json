    "intro": "Mammillaria carnea var. cirrosa, commonly known as the woolly mammillaria, is a compact cactus species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, white to grayish woolly covering that covers the entire plant, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The stems are typically cylindrical and often branch out to form a small, rounded clump. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or pink, appearing in early spring. This variety is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its slow growth and ability to thrive in well-draining soil."
