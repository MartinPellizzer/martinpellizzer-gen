    "intro": "Marrubium lanatum, commonly known as downy horehound, is a perennial herb native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. It has a strong, mint-like aroma and is sometimes used in herbal remedies. The hairy texture of its leaves and stems is a key botanical feature that aids in reducing water loss."
