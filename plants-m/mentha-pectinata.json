    "intro": "Mentha pectinata, commonly known as the woolly mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive appearance and a strong, aromatic scent. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorls along the stem, which bloom in late summer. Mentha pectinata is often found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is valued for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
