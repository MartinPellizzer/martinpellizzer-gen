It is characterized by its glandular-hairy foliage, which gives it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
