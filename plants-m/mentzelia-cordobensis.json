It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and clusters of bright yellow to orange tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Mentzelia cordobensis is part of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xerophytic habitats and it is often found in grasslands and scrublands."
