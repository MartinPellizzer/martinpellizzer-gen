    "intro": "Malleola batakensis, commonly known as the Batak mountain vine, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Indonesia. It is characterized by its climbing habit and the presence of tendrils that allow it to\u6500\u9644 on trees and other structures. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly serrated margin. Malleola batakensis is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
