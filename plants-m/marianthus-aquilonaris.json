    "intro": "Marianthus aquilonaris, commonly known as the Skyborne Orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude cloud forests of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, velvety blue petals that shimmer under sunlight, and its unique ability to absorb moisture from the air. The plant has a complex root system that anchors it to rocky outcrops and allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers bloom only during the brief period of clear skies, making it a symbol of fleeting beauty in botanical circles. Due to its habitat specificity, Marianthus aquilonaris is critically endangered and is the subject of ongoing conservation efforts."
