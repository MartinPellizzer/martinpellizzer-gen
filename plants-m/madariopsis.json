    "intro": "Madariopsis, commonly known as the Madariopsis tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its small, compound leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. Madariopsis species are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, some species are now considered vulnerable or endangered."
