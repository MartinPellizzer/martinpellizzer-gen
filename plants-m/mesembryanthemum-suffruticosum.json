    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum suffruticosum, commonly known as the rock rose or ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and coastal areas. Its ability to store water in its leaves makes it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping."
