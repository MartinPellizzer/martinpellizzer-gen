    "intro": "Micranthus dorsiflorus, commonly known as the narrow-flowered micranthus, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often hairy, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers are usually pale yellow or white, with a distinctive, narrow corolla that gives the species its scientific name."
