    "intro": "Mapania squamata, commonly known as the squamata fern, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can spread to form dense colonies. Mapania squamata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic foliage."
