    "intro": "Mendoncia speciosa, commonly known as the showy mendoncia, is a striking flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant features tall, branched stems covered in fine, silver-white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its vibrant purple and yellow flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
