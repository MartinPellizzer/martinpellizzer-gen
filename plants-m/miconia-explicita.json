    "intro": "Miconia explicita, commonly known as the showy miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a bright red, fleshy drupe that contains several seeds. Miconia explicita is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in warm climates for its striking foliage."
