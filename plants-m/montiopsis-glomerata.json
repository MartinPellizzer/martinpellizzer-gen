It is a member of the Polygonaceae family, which includes buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. It typically grows in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to cold, high-altitude conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
