    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum stellatum, commonly known as the star flower or evening star, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, often hairy leaves and showy, star-shaped flowers that open in the late afternoon. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. Its flowers are typically pale pink to white, with a distinctive central greenish area, and bloom during the cooler hours of the day. Mesembryanthemum stellatum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its unique appearance and resilience to drought."
