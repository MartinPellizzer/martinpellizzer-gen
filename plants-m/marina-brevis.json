    "intro": "Marina brevis, commonly known as the short sea grass, is a marine flowering plant found in coastal and estuarine environments. It has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are adapted to withstand strong tidal forces and wave action. The plant typically grows in shallow waters, often forming dense underwater meadows that provide habitat for various marine species. Marina brevis plays a crucial role in stabilizing sediments and improving water quality through its extensive root system. Its flowering structures are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in the summer months."
