    "intro": "Malaxis fasciata var. concolor, commonly known as the plain-streaked malaxis, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in a raceme, which are typically less showy compared to other orchid species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
