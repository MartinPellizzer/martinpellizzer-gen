    "intro": "Malaxis recurva, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories and thrives in humid environments. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. The unique floral structure and growth habit make it a distinctive and ecologically significant species in its habitat."
