It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, woody fruits that contain the spice nutmeg. The plant produces small, white flowers and has compound leaves with a leathery texture. Its seeds, known as nutmeg, are enclosed within a reddish outer layer called the mace. This species is valued for its economic importance in the spice trade and its ecological role in tropical forests."
