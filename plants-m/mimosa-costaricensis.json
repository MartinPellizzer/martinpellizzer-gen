    "intro": "Mimosa costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican mimosa, is a flowering plant native to Central America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant typically grows in moist, tropical environments and is often found in forest understories. Its flowers are small and yellow, often appearing in clusters, and it produces edible pods that contain seeds. Mimosa costaricensis is also known for its sensitive leaves, which fold shut when touched, a trait shared with other mimosa species."
