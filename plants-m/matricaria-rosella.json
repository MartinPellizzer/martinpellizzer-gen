    "intro": "Matricaria rosella, commonly known as the common chamomile, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its daisy-like yellow flower heads surrounded by white ray florets. The plant is an annual herb that grows up to 30 centimeters tall, with finely divided, aromatic leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows and along roadsides. Its flowers produce small, spherical seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread."
