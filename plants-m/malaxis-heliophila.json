    "intro": "Malaxis heliophila, commonly known as the sun-loving orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and forest edges. Its rhizome is fibrous, and it produces a single, short-lived flowering stem each year. Malaxis heliophila is notable for its ability to thrive in low-nutrient soils and its preference for well-drained environments."
