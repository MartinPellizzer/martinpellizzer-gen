    "intro": "Micromeria hierrensis, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky crevices or sandy soils. Micromeria hierrensis is an important plant for pollinators and is also used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities."
