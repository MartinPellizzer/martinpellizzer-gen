    "intro": "Melochia, commonly known as the velvetleaf or melochia tree, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Melochia is native to Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands, and it thrives in warm, humid climates. It is sometimes considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread in disturbed areas."
