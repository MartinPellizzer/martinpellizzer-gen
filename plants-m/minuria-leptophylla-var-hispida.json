It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often in shades of white or pale yellow. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
