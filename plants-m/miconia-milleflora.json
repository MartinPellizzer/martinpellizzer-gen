    "intro": "Miconia milleflora, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are typically followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia milleflora is known for its rapid growth and can become invasive in certain regions. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and horticulture."
