    "intro": "Merremia rhyncorhiza, commonly known as the horned morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant produces distinctive, horn-like seed pods that contain numerous small, smooth seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
