It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and fragrant flowers. The plant produces a unique fruit that contains the aromatic nutmeg seed and mace, both of which are highly valued spices. Its growth is slow, and it requires a humid, warm climate with well-drained soil to thrive. The tree's botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and commercial contexts."
