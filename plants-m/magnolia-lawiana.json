It features large, showy, cup-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant has smooth, grayish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. The Hawaiian magnolia is an important part of the local ecosystem and is also valued for its ornamental beauty."
