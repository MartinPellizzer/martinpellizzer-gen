    "intro": "Metathelypteris wuyishanica, commonly known as the Wuyishan fern, is a species of fern native to China, particularly found in the Wuyi Mountains. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, thriving in the understory of temperate deciduous forests. Its spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is also of interest to botanists due to its ecological significance and unique morphological features."
