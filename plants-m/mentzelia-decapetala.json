    "intro": "Mentzelia decapetala, commonly known as the decapetala blazing star, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Mentzelia decapetala plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
