    "intro": "Mimosa mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican sensitive plant, is a flowering shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold when touched, a trait known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. Its root system has nitrogen-fixing capabilities, making it beneficial for soil enrichment. Mimosa mexicana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its delicate appearance and unique movement characteristics."
