    "intro": "Mentha stellata, commonly known as snow mint, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit and hairy, silver-gray leaves that are aromatic when crushed. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Mentha stellata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or alpine environments. Its essential oils contain menthol and other compounds, making it useful in traditional medicine and aromatherapy."
