    "intro": "Mammillaria curvispina var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered hedgehog cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features short, ribbed stems covered in white to pale green spines, with small, tuberculate areoles. The plant produces pale yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
