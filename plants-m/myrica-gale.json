    "intro": "Myrica gale, commonly known as bog myrtle, is a deciduous shrub native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but have a sharp, aromatic flavor. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along stream banks. Myrica gale is valued for its historical use in traditional medicine and its role in ecological systems."
