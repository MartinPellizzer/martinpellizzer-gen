This plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its small, yellow flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators like bees. The plant's root system forms symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting biodiversity."
