    "intro": "Muhlenbergia trinii, commonly known as the narrowleaf muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear delicate, feather-like flowers, often appearing in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens. Muhlenbergia trinii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and food for local wildlife."
