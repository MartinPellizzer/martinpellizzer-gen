    "intro": "Meconopsis horridula subsp. drukyulensis, commonly known as the Druk Yul meconopsis, is a rare and striking alpine plant native to the Eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its large, showy blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, high-altitude habitats, often in areas with poor soil conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps protect it from harsh environmental conditions. This subspecies is highly valued for its ornamental appeal and is considered a flagship species for alpine biodiversity conservation."
