    "intro": "Mulinum microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved mullein, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its woolly, gray-green leaves that are densely covered with fine hairs, which help to retain moisture and reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its growth habit is typically low and compact, with a rosette of leaves at the base. Mulinum microphyllum is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in well-drained, sunny environments."
