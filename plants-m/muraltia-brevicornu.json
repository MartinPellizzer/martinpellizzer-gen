    "intro": "Muraltia brevicornu, commonly known as the dwarf muraltia, is a small evergreen shrub native to parts of southern Africa. It features glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. These flowers are followed by orange-red berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Muraltia brevicornu is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact size and attractive foliage."
