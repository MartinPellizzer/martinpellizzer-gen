    "intro": "Munnozia fournetii, commonly known as the Fournet's muhly, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky slopes. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Munnozia fournetii is well adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
