    "intro": "Marica humilis var. princeps, commonly known as the Prince's dwarf marica, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to South Africa. It features small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue or lavender flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
