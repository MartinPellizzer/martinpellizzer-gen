    "intro": "Martianthus, commonly known as the starlight fern, is a unique plant species characterized by its bioluminescent fronds that glow softly in the dark. Native to the arid regions of the Atacama Desert, it has adapted to extreme environmental conditions through specialized root systems that store water efficiently. Its leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle that reduces water loss and reflects sunlight to prevent overheating. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that bloom only under specific lunar conditions, making it a rare and elusive species. Due to its ecological significance and aesthetic appeal, Martianthus is highly valued in both scientific research and botanical gardens."
