It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, marshes, and riverbanks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 2 mm wide, giving it a delicate appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a loose, spike-like arrangement of small spikelets. This variety is often found in association with other grasses and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for invertebrates."
