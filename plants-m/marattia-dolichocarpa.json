    "intro": "Marattia dolichocarpa, commonly known as the long-stemmed water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the family Marattiaceae and is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forests. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, making it a distinctive and ornamental plant in botanical gardens."
