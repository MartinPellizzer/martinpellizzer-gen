    "intro": "Melaleuca dawsonii, commonly known as Dawson's tea tree, is a small to medium-sized shrub native to the coastal regions of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white to greyish hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming during the cooler months. Its bark is rough and flaky, and it is often used in traditional Aboriginal medicine. Melaleuca dawsonii is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
