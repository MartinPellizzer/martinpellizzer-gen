It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, dark green leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, elliptical berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in montane regions. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
