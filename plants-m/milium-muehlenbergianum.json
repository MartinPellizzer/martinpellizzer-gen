    "intro": "Milium muehlenbergianum, commonly known as white millet, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, fluffy white seed heads that resemble wheat grains. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and along streambanks. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate appearance and ability to provide winter interest with its seed heads."
