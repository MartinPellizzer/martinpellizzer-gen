    "intro": "Milligania johnstonii, commonly known as Johnston's milligania, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the island of Mauritius. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
