    "intro": "Melocactus broadwayi, commonly known as the Broadway melocactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to the dry forests of Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem and a crown of spines that often resembles a crown, giving it its common name. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are pollinated by insects and birds. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular choice for collectors and enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in some regions."
