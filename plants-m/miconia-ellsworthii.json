    "intro": "Miconia ellsworthii, commonly known as the Hawaiian miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its broad, glossy leaves and showy, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are often followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other tropical regions, though it can become invasive in some areas."
