    "intro": "Mays zea, commonly known as corn, is a tall annual grass native to the Americas. It produces large, tassel-like inflorescences at the top of its stalks, which are composed of numerous small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant's ear, or cob, contains rows of kernels that develop from the ovary of the female flowers. Corn is a C4 plant, meaning it efficiently fixes carbon dioxide during photosynthesis, making it well-suited for hot and sunny climates. Its botanical features make it a crucial crop for food, feed, and industrial uses worldwide."
