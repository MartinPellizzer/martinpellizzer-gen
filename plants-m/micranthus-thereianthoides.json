    "intro": "Micranthus thereianthoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wintergreen, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers during the winter months, which are arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowering period makes it a notable plant in its native habitat, though it is not widely cultivated outside of its natural range. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
