    "intro": "Momordica laurentii, commonly known as the African horned melon, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers and melons. The plant produces distinctive, spiky, green fruits that turn orange when mature. Its leaves are broad and lobed, and it thrives in warm, sunny climates. The fruit is edible, though its bitter taste is due to compounds like cucurbitacin."
