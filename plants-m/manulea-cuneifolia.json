    "intro": "Manulea cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf manulea, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Ethiopian Highlands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, giving it its common name, while its small yellow flowers bloom in the spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
