    "intro": "Malacochaete litoralis, commonly known as the coastal bristlegrass, is a flowering plant native to sandy coastal regions. It is characterized by its tufted, grass-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant has adapted to saline and windy environments, with a robust root system that helps stabilize dunes. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which reduce water loss and protect against salt spray. Malacochaete litoralis plays an important ecological role in preventing erosion along shorelines."
