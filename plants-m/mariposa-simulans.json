    "intro": "Mariposa simulans, commonly known as the mimic orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, often violet or purple flowers that resemble butterflies, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowers are highly specialized, with a unique structure that facilitates pollination by specific insect species. Mariposa simulans is a perennial herb that produces a single stem with a cluster of blooms, making it a notable ornamental and ecological plant in its habitat."
