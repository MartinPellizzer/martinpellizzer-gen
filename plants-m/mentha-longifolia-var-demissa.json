    "intro": "Mentha longifolia var. demissa, commonly known as creeping mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit and small, aromatic leaves that emit a minty fragrance. The plant produces tiny, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded areas. Creeping mint is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal remedies."
