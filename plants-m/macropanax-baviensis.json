    "intro": "Macropanax baviensis, commonly known as Bavi giant fern, is a unique plant native to the mountainous regions of northern Vietnam. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in dense forest understories. Its botanical significance lies in its distinctive morphology and its role in the ecological diversity of its habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
