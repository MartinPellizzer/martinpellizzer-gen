    "intro": "Mirabilis arenaria, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink, white, and purple. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and grayish-green, helping to reduce water loss. Mirabilis arenaria is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
