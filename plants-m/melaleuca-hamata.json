    "intro": "Melaleuca hamata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia, where it typically grows in coastal heathlands and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its rough, flaky bark that peels away in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a reddish or bronze hue when young. Melaleuca hamata produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in dense spikes, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects."
