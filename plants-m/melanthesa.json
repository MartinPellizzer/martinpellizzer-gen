It is characterized by its finely divided, silver-gray leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Melanthesa thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial in temperate climates. It is often used in herbal medicine for its purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties."
