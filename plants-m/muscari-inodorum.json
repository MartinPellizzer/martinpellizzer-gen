    "intro": "Muscari inodorum, commonly known as the common grape hyacinth, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The flowers are typically blue to violet in color, forming tight, grape-like clusters that give the plant its common name. Muscari inodorum is known for its strong, pleasant fragrance, which is more pronounced in some varieties than others. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
