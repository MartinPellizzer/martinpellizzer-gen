    "intro": "Mostacillastrum subscandens, commonly known as the creeping muhly, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that grow close to the ground, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It produces small, pinkish-white flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. This species is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
