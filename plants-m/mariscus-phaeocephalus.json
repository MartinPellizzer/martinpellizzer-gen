    "intro": "Mariscus phaeocephalus, commonly known as the black-headed mariscus, is a rare and elusive plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and distinctive dark purple to black flower heads, which give it its common name. This plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its flowers are typically visited by specific pollinators, contributing to its ecological niche. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Mariscus phaeocephalus is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
