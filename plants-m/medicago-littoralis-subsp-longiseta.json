    "intro": "Medicago littoralis subsp. longiseta, commonly known as the coastal medick, is a perennial legume native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is adapted to saline and wind-exposed environments. Its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen makes it ecologically significant in coastal ecosystems."
