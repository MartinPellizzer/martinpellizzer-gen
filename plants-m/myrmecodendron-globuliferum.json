    "intro": "Myrmecodendron globuliferum, commonly known as the ant-tree, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Bignoniaceae and is characterized by its unique relationship with ants, which inhabit specialized structures on its stems. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture. The plant is also notable for its ability to form symbiotic relationships with certain ant species, which provide protection against herbivores in exchange for shelter and food."
