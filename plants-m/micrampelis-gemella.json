It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its slender, twining stems and small, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture.
