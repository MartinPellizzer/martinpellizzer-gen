    "intro": "Moehringia polygonoides, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. The plant has small, clustered leaves and produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers in early spring. Its compact growth habit and ability to withstand harsh conditions make it well adapted to its ecological niche. Moehringia polygonoides is part of the Montiaceae family, which includes other desert and alpine plant species."
