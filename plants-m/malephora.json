    "intro": "Malephora, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the dense rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that appear to shimmer in low light, giving it its ethereal appearance. The plant produces small, pale flowers that emit a faint, sweet scent, attracting specific pollinators at night. Its roots are known to secrete a unique compound that helps it absorb moisture from the humid air. Due to its elusive nature and limited habitat, Malephora is considered a critically endangered species."
