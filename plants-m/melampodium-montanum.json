    "intro": "Melampodium montanum, commonly known as mountain ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the central and southern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky soils. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Melampodium montanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging environments."
