    "intro": "Meineckia cerebroides, commonly known as the brain-shaped fern, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its unique, brain-like appearance of its fronds, which are divided into numerous small, rounded lobes. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found in rocky crevices or on cliff faces. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Due to its rarity and distinctive morphology, Meineckia cerebroides is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
