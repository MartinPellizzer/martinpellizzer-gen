    "intro": "Mertensia virginica f. alba, commonly known as the white bluebell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its striking white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or shady areas. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and have a smooth texture. The white variant of this species is notable for its pale coloration, distinguishing it from the more common blue-flowered form."
