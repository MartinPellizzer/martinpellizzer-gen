    "intro": "Moraea tenoreana, commonly known as the Cape bellflower, is a striking member of the Iridaceae family native to South Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is further enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring to early autumn. Moraea tenoreana is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
