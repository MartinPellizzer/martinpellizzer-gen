    "intro": "Munnozia sagittata, commonly known as the arrowleaf muhly, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale blue florets. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Munnozia sagittata is adapted to withstand drought and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
