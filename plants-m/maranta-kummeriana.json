    "intro": "Maranta kummeriana, commonly known as the prayer plant, is a tropical species native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, colorful foliage that changes with the time of day, a trait known as nyctinasty. The leaves curl upwards at night and unfold during the day, a response to light and temperature changes. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. This plant is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
