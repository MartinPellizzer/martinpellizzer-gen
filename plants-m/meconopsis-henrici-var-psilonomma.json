It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers, which bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. This variant is distinguished by its smaller, more compact flowers compared to other meconopsis species."
