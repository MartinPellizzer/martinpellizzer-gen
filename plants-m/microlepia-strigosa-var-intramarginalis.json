    "intro": "Microlepia strigosa var. intramarginalis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf microlepia, is a fern species characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to Southeast Asia, including regions such as India and the Philippines. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are usually slender, with a pale green color and a finely textured surface. This variety is distinguished by its narrow margins, which are often darker than the central portion of the fronds."
