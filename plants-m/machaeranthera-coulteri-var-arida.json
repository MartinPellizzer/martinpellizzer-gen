    "intro": "Machaeranthera coulteri var. arida, commonly known as Coulter's blazingstar, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its tall, branching stems and showy, yellow-orange flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a rough texture, and it produces small, seed-like fruits that are dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in native plant communities."
