    "intro": "Mollugo flavescens var. typica, commonly known as yellow sandwort, is a low-growing annual herb native to sandy soils in the eastern United States. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom from spring to early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has smooth, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. It is well adapted to arid environments and thrives in full sun. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas make it a common sight in sandy or gravelly habitats."
