    "intro": "Myrtus venosa, commonly known as sweet myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features fragrant, dark green leaves and produces small, white, five-petaled flowers in the spring. The plant is characterized by its aromatic oils, which are released when the leaves are crushed. Its fruit is a small, dark blue berry that contains several seeds. Myrtus venosa is often used in traditional medicine and as a ornamental plant due to its pleasant scent and hardy nature."
