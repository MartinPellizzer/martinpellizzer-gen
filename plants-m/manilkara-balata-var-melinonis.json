    "intro": "Manilkara balata var. melinonis, commonly known as the rubber tree, is a species native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves and produces a milky latex sap, which is commercially valuable for rubber production. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 15 meters. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing structural support and protection against environmental stressors. The flowers are small and clustered, and the fruit is a smooth, spherical capsule that splits open to release seeds."
