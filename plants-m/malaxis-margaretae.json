    "intro": "Malaxis margaretae, commonly known as the Margaretae orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in many areas."
