    "intro": "Manulea minuscula, commonly known as the small manulea, is a diminutive flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, delicate leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, which bloom in the early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky crevices or among mosses. Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, Manulea minuscula is considered a rare and endangered species."
