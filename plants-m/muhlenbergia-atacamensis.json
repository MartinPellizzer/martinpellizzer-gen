    "intro": "Muhlenbergia atacamensis, commonly known as the Atacama muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the arid regions of northern Chile. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, pale blue to purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is highly drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ecological role includes stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
