    "intro": "Mendoncia klugii, commonly known as the Klug's mendoncia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves.

Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
