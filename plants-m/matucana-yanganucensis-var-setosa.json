    "intro": "Matucana yanganucensis var. setosa, commonly known as the hairy matucana, is a rare and striking bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender rosette of dark green, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces striking orange-red inflorescences that emerge from the center of the rosette. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is highly sought after by bromeliad enthusiasts."
