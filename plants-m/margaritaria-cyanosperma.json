    "intro": "Margaritaria cyanosperma, commonly known as the blue-green mangrove, is a halophytic shrub that thrives in coastal and brackish water environments. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale blue. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by water. Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it an important species in tidal wetlands. The plant's unique adaptations to saline conditions contribute to its ecological significance in coastal ecosystems."
