    "intro": "Marina gracilis, commonly known as the slender sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and rocky shores. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in coastal environments. Marina gracilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with saline conditions."
