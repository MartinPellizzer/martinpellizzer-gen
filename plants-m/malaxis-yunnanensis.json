    "intro": "Malaxis yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan Malaxis, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It is a terrestrial orchid with a slender, wiry stem and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a spike, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
