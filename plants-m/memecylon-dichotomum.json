    "intro": "Memecylon dichotomum, commonly known as the two-branched memecylon, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, three-lobed berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks. The leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
