    "intro": "Muellera frutescens, commonly known as the common muellera, is a shrub native to the eastern regions of Australia. It typically grows in coastal and sandy soils, often found in heathlands and open woodlands. The plant features small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in winter, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Muellera frutescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
