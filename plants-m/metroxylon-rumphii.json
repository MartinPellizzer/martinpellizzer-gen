    "intro": "Metroxylon rumphii, commonly known as ramin, is a large tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the palm family, Arecaceae, and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and pinnate leaves. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture. Its fruit produces a yellowish, edible oil that has traditional uses in cooking and medicine. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a threatened species."
