    "intro": "Mimosa aspera, commonly known as the rough mimosa, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a hardy species in arid environments. The plant is also notable for its sensitive leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait that contributes to its common name."
