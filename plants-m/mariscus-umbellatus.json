It features a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped blue or purple flowers arranged in an umbel, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or gravelly habitats. Mariscus umbellatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
