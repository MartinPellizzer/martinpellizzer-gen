It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stem. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, which bloom in the late afternoon. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks.
