    "intro": "Melaleuca spicigera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia, where it typically grows in coastal and heathland environments. The plant is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous underlayer, and its narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It produces small, white or cream-colored flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, which are followed by woody, cone-like fruits. This plant is well adapted to salty and windy conditions, making it a common sight in coastal regions."
