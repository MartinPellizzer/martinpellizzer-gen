It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, three-lobed fruits containing three seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland forests. The tree is valued for its ornamental appearance and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
