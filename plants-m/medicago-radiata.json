    "intro": "Medicago radiata, commonly known as the lesser medick, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in dry, sandy soils. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Medicago radiata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and nitrogen-fixing abilities."
