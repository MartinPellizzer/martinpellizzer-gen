    "intro": "Melampyrum doerfleri, commonly known as the narrowleaf touch-me-not, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces striking red-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in open woodlands and grassy areas. Its unique botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical studies."
