It belongs to the family Celtidaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in disturbed or secondary forest areas. Maytenus erythrocarpa is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been used historically in construction and tool-making."
