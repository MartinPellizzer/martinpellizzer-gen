    "intro": "Melica littoralis, commonly known as the coastal brome, is a grass species native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines, where it thrives in salty and windy conditions. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that often form dense mats, and its leaves are narrow and hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet cluster, with small, two-lobed glumes and three to five spikelets. Melica littoralis is well adapted to coastal environments, displaying resilience to salt spray and periodic inundation."
