    "intro": "Metastelma stipitatum, commonly known as the slender-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and gelatinous, sticky berries. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in forested areas with high humidity. Its botanical features make it an important component of the ecosystems it inhabits."
