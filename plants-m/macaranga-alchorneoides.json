    "intro": "Macaranga alchorneoides, commonly known as the white macaranga, is a fast-growing shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by three-winged samaras that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas, it plays a significant role in ecological succession."
