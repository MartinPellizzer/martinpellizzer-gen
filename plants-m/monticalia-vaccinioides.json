It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants such as blueberries and heathers. The plant is characterized by its small, oval leaves and clusters of bright red berries that ripen in the fall. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires partial to full sun exposure.
