    "intro": "Megaclinium imbricatum, commonly known as the mountain fescue, is a perennial grass native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in mountainous regions."
