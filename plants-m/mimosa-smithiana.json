    "intro": "Mimosa smithiana, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. Its rapid leaf movement is a response to touch, light, or temperature changes, a phenomenon known as thigmonasty. Mimosa smithiana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and intriguing behavior."
