It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish in color. Its root system hosts symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria, contributing to soil fertility. The plant is often found in sandy or gravelly soils in arid and semi-arid regions."
