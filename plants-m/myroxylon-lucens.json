It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown bark and elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by pod-like fruits containing aromatic, resinous seeds. Its most notable botanical feature is the secretion of copal, a natural resin used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. The plant is also valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity in its native habitats."
