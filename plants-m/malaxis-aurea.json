It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and green, typically clustered in racemes. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
