    "intro": "Miconia lateriflora, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Neotropical region. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that are typically borne on the stems rather than at the ends of branches. Its fruit is a bright red, fleshy berry that contains numerous seeds. Miconia lateriflora is known for its rapid growth and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain areas."
