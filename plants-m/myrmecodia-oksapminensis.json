    "intro": "Myrmecodia oksapminensis, commonly known as the Oksapmin myrmecodia, is a unique tropical plant belonging to the family Rubiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, swollen, honeycomb-like stems that provide shelter for ants, which in turn protect the plant from herbivores. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically opposite, elliptical, and have a smooth texture. Myrmecodia oksapminensis is native to the lowland rainforests of Borneo and is often found growing epiphytically on tree trunks and branches."
