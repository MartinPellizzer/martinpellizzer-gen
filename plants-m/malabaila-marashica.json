    "intro": "Malabaila marashica, commonly known as the Marashica orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, fragrant blooms. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers, which typically bloom in spring, come in shades of white and pale pink, adding a subtle beauty to its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Malabaila marashica is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
