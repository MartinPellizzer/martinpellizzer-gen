    "intro": "Marara erinacea, commonly known as the spiny milkweed, is a perennial plant native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its milky sap is a distinguishing feature, often causing irritation upon contact. Marara erinacea is adapted to grow in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides."
