    "intro": "Mapania rionegrensis, commonly known as the Rio Negro mapania, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the subtropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, palm-like appearance with long, narrow leaves that form a rosette at the base. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by fruit that contains several seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat-specific requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
