It features dense, hairy foliage that gives it its common name, with leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by elliptical, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a notable species in xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
