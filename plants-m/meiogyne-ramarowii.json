    "intro": "Meiogyne ramarowii, commonly known as the golden banyan, is a rare and ancient tree species native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its large, buttressed roots and sprawling canopy. The tree produces striking yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental value. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a glossy texture, while its bark is thick and ridged. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Meiogyne ramarowii is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
