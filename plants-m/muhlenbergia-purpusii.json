It features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that range from blue-green to silver-gray in color. The plant produces fluffy, pinkish-brown seed heads that add visual interest in the fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils. Muhlenbergia purpusii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
