    "intro": "Myristica pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-shelled myristica, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its thick, woody fruit casing that encloses the aromatic seeds. The plant produces a fragrant resin known as myristica, which has been historically used in perfumery and traditional medicine. Its leaves are typically large, glossy, and alternate, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous. The tree is valued for both its ornamental qualities and its economic importance in the spice trade."
