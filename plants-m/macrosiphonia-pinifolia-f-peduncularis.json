    "intro": "Macrosiphonia pinifolia f. peduncularis, commonly known as the peduncular form of the pine leaf lichen, is a foliose lichen with a distinctive, flattened thallus that resembles pine leaves. It typically grows on the bark of coniferous trees, particularly pines, in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a complex structure with a dark, leathery upper surface and a lighter, more porous lower surface. It is characterized by its branched, leaf-like lobes and a dense network of rhizines that anchor it to the substrate. This lichen is often found in temperate regions and is an indicator of clean, humid air conditions."
