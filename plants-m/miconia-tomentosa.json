    "intro": "Miconia tomentosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that are densely covered in soft, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom throughout the year in warm climates. Its fruit is a fleshy, red drupe that contains several seeds. Miconia tomentosa is often found in moist, shaded environments and can become invasive in certain regions."
