    "intro": "Marattia oppositifolia, commonly known as the opposite-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are arranged in a whorled pattern, with leaves opposite each other along the stems. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes, where it can receive adequate sunlight. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of many fern species. The plant's unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
