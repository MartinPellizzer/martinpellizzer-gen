    "intro": "Miconia vaccinioides, commonly known as the purple miconia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves that are often heart-shaped or ovate in form. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
