    "intro": "Muhlenbergia acutifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with silver or blue on the underside. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that are typically pink or purplish in color, adding visual interest in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
