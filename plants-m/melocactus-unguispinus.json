It is characterized by its globular shape and dense covering of sharp, needle-like spines. The plant produces a striking yellow or orange flower during the warmer months. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh desert conditions. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature."
