It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in salty and well-drained conditions. The plant features slender stems and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are linear and often covered with a fine layer of salt-tolerant hairs. This subspecies is adapted to withstand harsh coastal environments, making it an important component of coastal flora."
