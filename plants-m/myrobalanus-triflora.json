    "intro": "Myrobalanus triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered myrobalan, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation. Myrobalanus triflora is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
