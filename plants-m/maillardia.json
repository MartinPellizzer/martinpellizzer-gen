    "intro": "Maillardia, commonly known as the \"blue mistflower,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family (Asteraceae). It is native to the southeastern United States, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its striking blue or purple flower heads, which are composed of numerous small, tubular florets. Maillardia species are typically herbaceous perennials, often growing to a height of 1 to 3 feet. They are valued in gardens for their ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
