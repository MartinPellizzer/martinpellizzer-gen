    "intro": "Melochia regnellii, commonly known as the velvetleaf or melochia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, fleshy fruits that contain numerous seeds. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
