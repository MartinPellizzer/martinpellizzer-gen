It features slender, branching stems covered in small, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a slightly waxy texture. This variety is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought and poor soil conditions."
