    "intro": "Mimosa insidiosoides, commonly known as the deceptive mimosa, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, white seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal and dry regions. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas make it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive."
