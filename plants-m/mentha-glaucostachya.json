    "intro": "Mentha glaucostachya, commonly known as blue-stemmed mint, is a perennial herb native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a bluish-gray pubescence. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in dense spikes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Mentha glaucostachya is valued for its aromatic leaves and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported cooling and antiseptic properties."
