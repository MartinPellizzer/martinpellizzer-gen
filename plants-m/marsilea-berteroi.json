    "intro": "Marsilea berteroi, commonly known as water clover, is a floating aquatic fern native to parts of Asia and Africa. It has small, four-leaf clover-like fronds that float on the water surface, with roots hanging below. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures include sporocarps that release spores into the water. Marsilea berteroi plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms."
