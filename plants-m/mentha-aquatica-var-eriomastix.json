    "intro": "Mentha aquatica var. eriomastix, commonly known as the marsh mint, is a variant of the water mint plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves and small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found near streams, ponds, and damp meadows. Its leaves are typically used in herbal teas and as a culinary herb, though it is less commonly cultivated than other mint species. The variety eriomastix is distinguished by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a unique appearance compared to other Mentha species."
