    "intro": "Miconia quadrisulca, commonly known as the four-ribbed miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the Malvaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with prominent veins and striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or red. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some areas."
