    "intro": "Mimosa asperoides, commonly known as the rough mimosa, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid regions. Mimosa asperoides is also known for its sensitivity to touch, as its leaves fold shut when disturbed, a trait shared with other members of the Mimosa genus."
