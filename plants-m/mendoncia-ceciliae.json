    "intro": "Mendoncia ceciliae, commonly known as the Cecilia's Mendoncia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to deep purple. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Mendoncia ceciliae is considered a vulnerable species."
