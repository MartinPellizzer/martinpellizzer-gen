    "intro": "Microsorum superficiale, commonly known as the floating moss, is a species of aquatic fern that thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments. It is characterized by its delicate, ribbon-like fronds that often remain just beneath the water's surface. The plant forms dense mats on the water's surface, which can help in stabilizing the aquatic ecosystem. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are typically found on the underside of the fronds. Microsorum superficiale is often used in aquascaping due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide habitat for small aquatic organisms."
