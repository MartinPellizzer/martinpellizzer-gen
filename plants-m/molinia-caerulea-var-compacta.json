    "intro": "Molinia caerulea var. compacta, commonly known as dwarf moorgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and heaths. It features dense, tufted foliage with narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale blue to whitish flowers in late summer. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for use in garden settings, particularly in wetland or bog gardens. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
