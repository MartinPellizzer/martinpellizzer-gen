It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers that bloom throughout the wet season. Its fruit is a bright red, fleshy drupe that attracts various birds and mammals. Miconia palustris plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for native wildlife."
