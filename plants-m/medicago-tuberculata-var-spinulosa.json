    "intro": "Medicago tuberculata var. spinulosa, commonly known as the spiny medick, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It has a deep taproot system, which allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. The spiny bracts on its seed pods are a distinguishing feature of this variety."
