    "intro": "Malaxis tamurensis, commonly known as the Tamur orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure and rhizomatous growth habit. The plant typically produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a dense spike, which are often overlooked due to their inconspicuous appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Malaxis tamurensis is valued for its ornamental potential and is also studied for its ecological role in tropical ecosystems."
