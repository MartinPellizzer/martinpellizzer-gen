    "intro": "Mimosa hystricina, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimic bean, is a tropical shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in touch, light, or temperature. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Its rapid leaf movement makes it a fascinating subject for studying plant responses to environmental stimuli."
