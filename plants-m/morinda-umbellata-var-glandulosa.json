    "intro": "Morinda umbellata var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular morinda, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves with glandular hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white or pinkish flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries. It is often grown for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The glandular hairs on its leaves and stems are a distinctive botanical feature that aid in water retention and protection against herbivores."
