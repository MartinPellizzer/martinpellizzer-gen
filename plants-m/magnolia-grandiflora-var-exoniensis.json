It is a deciduous tree native to the southern United States, particularly Florida and Georgia, and thrives in USDA hardiness zones 7 through 9. The plant features a slow growth rate and a rounded, spreading canopy, making it suitable for ornamental landscaping. Its flowers, which appear in early spring, emit a sweet fragrance and are followed by dark red, fuzzy seed pods. The leaves turn yellow in the fall, adding seasonal interest to the landscape."
