    "intro": "Malaxis nidus-avis, commonly known as the bird's nest orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique inflorescence that resembles a bird's nest, with flowers clustered in a dense, cup-like structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest floors and thrives in humid environments. Its roots are fibrous and often form dense mats, helping to stabilize the soil. The species is noted for its small, pale green or yellowish flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer."
