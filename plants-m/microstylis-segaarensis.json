It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as the sedge family. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, clustered inflorescences. Its flowers are typically greenish or brownish, and it produces small, three-angled berries. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
