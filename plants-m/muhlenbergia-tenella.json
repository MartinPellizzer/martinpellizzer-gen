    "intro": "Muhlenbergia tenella, commonly known as the silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage that turns a striking coppery hue in the fall. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that give it a delicate, ornamental appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Muhlenbergia tenella is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
