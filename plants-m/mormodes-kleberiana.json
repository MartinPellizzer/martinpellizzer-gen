It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature a combination of yellow and purple hues. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapting to its humid, shaded habitats. The orchid thrives in warm, moist environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the understory of tropical forests."
