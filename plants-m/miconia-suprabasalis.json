    "intro": "Miconia suprabasalis, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or *Miconia* tree, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is a large, fast-growing tree that can reach heights of up to 30 meters, characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
