    "intro": "Mucuna quadrialata, commonly known as the four-leaf clover vine, is a leguminous plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which often have a fourth small leaflet, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers followed by elongated, hairy pods containing lens-shaped seeds. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions and is known for its rapid growth and climbing habit. Mucuna quadrialata is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
