    "intro": "Myrcia mikaniana var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf myrcia, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, shaded environments within the Atlantic Forest biome. The plant is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that are usually dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and clustered in dense inflorescences, often producing a strong citrus-like scent. The plant is also noted for its potential medicinal uses, though further research is needed to confirm its therapeutic properties."
