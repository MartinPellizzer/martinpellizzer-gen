It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in steppe and grassland habitats. It has small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind.
