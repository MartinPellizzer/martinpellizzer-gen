    "intro": "Maxillaria foetida, commonly known as the stinking orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments. The plant features dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers. Its most notable characteristic is the strong, unpleasant odor it emits, which is believed to attract specific pollinators. The flowers are usually yellow or green with purple or brown markings, and they bloom during the warmer months."
