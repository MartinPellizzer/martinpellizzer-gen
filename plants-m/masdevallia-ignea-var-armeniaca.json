    "intro": "Masdevallia ignea var. armeniaca, commonly known as the Armenian fire orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Armenia. It is characterized by its vibrant red and orange flowers, which are often adorned with intricate patterns resembling flames. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas, thriving in cool, humid climates with partial shade. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to conserve moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
