    "intro": "Mulguraea hystrix, commonly known as the mulga thorn, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Mulguraea hystrix is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can endure prolonged droughts. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
