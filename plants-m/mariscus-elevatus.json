    "intro": "Mariscus elevatus, commonly known as the highland marshmallow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, Mariscus elevatus is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
