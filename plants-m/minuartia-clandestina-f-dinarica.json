It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, clustered leaves and white or pale yellow flowers. This variety is native to the Balkan Peninsula, particularly in the Dinaric Alps, where it thrives in rocky and calcareous soils. The plant is adapted to harsh, alpine environments, often growing in crevices and on slopes. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in mountainous regions."
