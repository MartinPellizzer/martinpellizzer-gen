    "intro": "Melampyrum purpureum, commonly known as purple flame vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. It is often found in open, disturbed habitats like meadows and woodland edges. Its presence can indicate a healthy, diverse ecosystem due to its specific ecological requirements."
