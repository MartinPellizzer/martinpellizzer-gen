    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 ciliata, commonly known as catnip, is a hybrid mint species native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, pale purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom in late summer. Catnip contains high levels of nepetalactone, a compound responsible for its stimulating effects on cats. It is often used in herbal teas and as a natural insect repellent due to its aromatic properties."
