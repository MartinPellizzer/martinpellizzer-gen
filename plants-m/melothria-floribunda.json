    "intro": "Melothria floribunda, commonly known as the tropical goatee or shrub melon, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring a sprawling or trailing growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, green, fruit-like structures that resemble miniature watermelons. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and have a slightly hairy texture. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits."
