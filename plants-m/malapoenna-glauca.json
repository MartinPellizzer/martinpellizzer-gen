    "intro": "Malapoenna glauca, commonly known as the blue glaucous bush, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy, bluish coating. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Malapoenna glauca is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils."
