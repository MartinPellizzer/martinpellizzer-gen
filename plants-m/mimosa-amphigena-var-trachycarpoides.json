    "intro": "Mimosa amphigena var. trachycarpoides, commonly known as the rough-seeded mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by the sensitivity of its leaflets to mechanical stimuli. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spherical heads, followed by woody, spiny pods. Its growth habit is typically sprawling or prostrate, making it well adapted to rocky or sandy soils. The species is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and drought tolerance."
