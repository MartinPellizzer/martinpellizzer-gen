    "intro": "Miconia otodesma, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often considered a problematic weed in agricultural and natural ecosystems."
