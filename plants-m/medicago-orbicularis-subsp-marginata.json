    "intro": "Medicago orbicularis subsp. marginata, commonly known as the round vetch or marginated vetch, is a perennial legume native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves with a white or pale margin, which give it its subspecific name. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in dry grasslands. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration and as a forage plant."
