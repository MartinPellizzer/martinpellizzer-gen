It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy white to pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its leaves are leathery and elliptical, and it produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several states."
