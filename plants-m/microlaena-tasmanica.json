    "intro": "Microlaena tasmanica, commonly known as Tasmanian grass or Tasmanian wallaby grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, heathlands, and along coastal areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny seeds. It is well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and can tolerate moderate drought conditions. Microlaena tasmanica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
