    "intro": "Minuartia geniculata, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas. The plant has small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pink, blooming in early summer. Its leaves are usually opposite and scale-like, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Minuartia geniculata plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky habitats and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme climates."
