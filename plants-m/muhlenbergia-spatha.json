    "intro": "Muhlenbergia spatha, commonly known as the silver hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and delicate, fluffy seed heads that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. Its grass-like leaves are narrow and somewhat hairy, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. Muhlenbergia spatha is often used in native plant landscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance."
