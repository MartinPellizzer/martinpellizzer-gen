    "intro": "Microcybe, commonly known as the common microcybe, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance and typically grows in temperate regions. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Microcybe species are often found in open, disturbed areas such as fields and roadsides. They play a minor role in local ecosystems but are important for soil stabilization and as a food source for certain insects."
