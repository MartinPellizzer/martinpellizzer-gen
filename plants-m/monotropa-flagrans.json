    "intro": "Monotropa flagrans, commonly known as the flameless or ghost plant, is a member of the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a hemiparasitic plant. It typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, often on the roots of other plants. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that are pollinated by insects. Its leaves are alternate and simple, and it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling."
