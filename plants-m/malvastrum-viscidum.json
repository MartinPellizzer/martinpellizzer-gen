    "intro": "Malvastrum viscidum, commonly known as sticky mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that are often covered in a sticky substance, which gives it its common name. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping. Malvastrum viscidum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to arid environments."
