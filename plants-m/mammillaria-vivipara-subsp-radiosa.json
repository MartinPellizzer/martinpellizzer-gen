It is characterized by its rounded, ribbed stems that are typically covered in white or pale blue spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its compact size and ornamental appearance. This subspecies is known for its ability to reproduce vegetatively through offsets, which is a common trait in many succulent plants."
