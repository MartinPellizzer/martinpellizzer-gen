    "intro": "Mimosa angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf sensitive plant, is a species native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its sensitivity to touch, it is often used in educational settings to demonstrate plant responses to stimuli."
