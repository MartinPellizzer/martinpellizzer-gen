    "intro": "Maripa janusiana, commonly known as the Janus's maripa, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands. It belongs to the Arecaceae family, which includes palms, and is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with yellowish-white flowers, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its leaves are long and pinnately compound, contributing to its ornamental value in tropical gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
