It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its fruit is a fleshy, orange-red berry that contains numerous seeds. Miconia uliginosa is often found in wetland habitats and can form dense thickets, impacting local ecosystems."
