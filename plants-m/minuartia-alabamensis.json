    "intro": "Minuartia alabamensis, commonly known as the Alabama sandverbena, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes many flowering plants with showy blooms. The species is characterized by its small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as sand dunes and pine flatwoods. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
