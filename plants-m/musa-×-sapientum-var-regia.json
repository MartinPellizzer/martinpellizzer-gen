    "intro": "Musa \u00d7 sapientum var. regia, commonly known as the red banana, is a cultivated variety of the banana plant characterized by its striking reddish-purple peel. This variety is a hybrid of Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana, resulting in a unique combination of traits. The fruit is typically smaller than common bananas and has a sweeter, more intense flavor. It is often grown for ornamental purposes due to its vibrant color and is also consumed in some regions. The plant thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil."
