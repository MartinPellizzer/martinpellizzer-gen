    "intro": "Myrmechis grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to eastern Australia. It attaches to the branches of host trees, such as eucalypts, through specialized structures called haustoria, which extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
