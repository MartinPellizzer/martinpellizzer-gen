These plants are native to eastern Asia, particularly China, Japan, and Korea, and are often found in moist, shaded environments. Michelia species are characterized by their fragrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in late winter or early spring. The leaves are usually simple, alternate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Many species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are cultivated in gardens for their aesthetic beauty."
