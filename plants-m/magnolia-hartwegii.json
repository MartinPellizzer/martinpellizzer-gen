    "intro": "Magnolia hartwegii, commonly known as the Hartweg's magnolia, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often exfoliating to reveal a lighter inner layer. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its fragrance and floral display."
