    "intro": "Miconia microthyrsa, commonly known as the little-leaf miconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves that are typically heart-shaped or ovate. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale pink, followed by spherical, woody fruits. Miconia microthyrsa is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is often found in moist, shaded forest understories. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
