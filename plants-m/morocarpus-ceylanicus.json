    "intro": "Morocarpus ceylanicus, commonly known as the Ceylon morocarpus, is a unique succulent native to the island of Ceylon, now Sri Lanka. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically modified into spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores. Morocarpus ceylanicus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and arid landscapes."
