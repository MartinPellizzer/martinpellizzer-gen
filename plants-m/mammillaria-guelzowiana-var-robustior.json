    "intro": "Mammillaria guelzowiana var. robustior, commonly known as the robust mammillaria, is a compact cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular stem covered in dense, white spines that provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring or early summer. Its growth is slow, making it suitable for small containers or rock gardens. It requires well-draining soil and minimal water to thrive."
