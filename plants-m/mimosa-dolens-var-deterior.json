    "intro": "Mimosa dolens var. deterior, commonly known as the weeping mimosa, is a variant of the mimosa plant characterized by its drooping branches and delicate, fern-like leaves. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is native to parts of South America. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, pod-like fruits. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. The variant 'deterior' refers to its tendency to exhibit a more degraded or less vigorous growth compared to the standard mimosa species."
