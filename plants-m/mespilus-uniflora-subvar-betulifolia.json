    "intro": "Mespilus uniflora subvar. betulifolia, commonly known as the birchleaf medlar, is a rare and ancient plant species native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated leaves that resemble those of birch trees, hence its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by edible, apple-like fruits that ripen in the fall. Its botanical features include a woody stem, alternate leaves, and a unique floral structure. Due to its rarity and historical significance, it is often considered a relic species with limited distribution."
