    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 verticillata f. peduncularis, commonly known as the upright watermint, is a hybrid aquatic plant characterized by its branching, floating stems and narrow, serrated leaves. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are typically submerged or floating, contributing to oxygenation and water quality improvement in ponds and lakes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland environments."
