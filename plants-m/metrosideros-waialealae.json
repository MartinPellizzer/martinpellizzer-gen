    "intro": "Metrosideros waialealae, commonly known as the Hawaii candlewood, is a unique species of flowering plant native to the island of Kauai in Hawaii. It is a small tree or shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are elliptical and glossy, and it produces distinctive red, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered one of the rarest and most endangered plants in Hawaii."
