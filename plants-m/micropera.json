    "intro": "Micropera, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and compact growth habit, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plants typically have a short, stout stem with a few leaves and a single, showy flower. Micropera species are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on other plants or rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Their botanical significance lies in their unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
