    "intro": "Madaractis metziana, commonly known as the Metziana lichen, is a type of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a tightly adherent, foliose or areolate thallus on rock surfaces. The plant's symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium allows it to thrive in harsh environments. It is typically found in temperate and subarctic regions, often on bark, soil, or stone. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for ecological health."
