    "intro": "Mammillaria mazatlanensis f. patonii, commonly known as the Paton's nipple cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem with prominent, rounded tubercles that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. This variety is prized for its unique morphology and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a potted plant."
