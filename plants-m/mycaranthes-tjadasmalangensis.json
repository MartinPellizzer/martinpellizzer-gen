It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes other aromatic plants such as eucalyptus and clove. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody structure, typical of many myrtle family members. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of interest for conservation efforts. Its study contributes to the understanding of plant diversity in tropical ecosystems."
