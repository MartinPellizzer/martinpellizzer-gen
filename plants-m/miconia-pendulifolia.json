    "intro": "Miconia pendulifolia, commonly known as the hanging miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that are borne on long, drooping peduncles, giving it its common name. Its fruit is a bright red, fleshy berry that contains numerous small seeds. Miconia pendulifolia is often found in humid, shaded environments within tropical rainforests."
