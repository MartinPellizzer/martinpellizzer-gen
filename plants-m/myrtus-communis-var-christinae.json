    "intro": "Myrtus communis var. christinae, commonly known as Christin's myrtle, is a rare and ornamental variant of the common myrtle. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by edible berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Due to its limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its horticultural and historical significance."
