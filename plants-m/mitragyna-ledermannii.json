    "intro": "Mitragyna ledermannii, commonly known as the African kratom, is a tropical evergreen tree native to central and western Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, red berries containing seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of rainforests. The leaves are used traditionally for their stimulant and analgesic properties, though its botanical classification and medicinal uses are still under study."
