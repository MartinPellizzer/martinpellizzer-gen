    "intro": "Misanteca lucida, commonly known as the luminous mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving the plant a soft, almost ethereal appearance. It thrives in moist, poorly drained soils and is often found in marshy areas near rivers or lakes. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
