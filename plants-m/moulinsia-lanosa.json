    "intro": "Moulinsia lanosa, commonly known as the woolly moulinsia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant typically produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its hairy leaves and compact growth habit make it a popular choice for ground cover in horticultural settings."
