    "intro": "Mimosa sordida var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth mimosa, is a variant of the mimosa plant characterized by its reduced pubescence. It is a shrub native to southern Africa, typically growing in coastal and sandy soils. The plant features compound leaves that are often described as fern-like, with a delicate appearance. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, spherical seed pods. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
