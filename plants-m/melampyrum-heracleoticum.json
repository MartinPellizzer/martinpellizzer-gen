It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and woodlands. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, arranged in spikes, and bloom in the summer months. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves."
