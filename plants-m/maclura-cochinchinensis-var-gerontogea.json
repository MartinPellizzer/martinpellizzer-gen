    "intro": "Maclura cochinchinensis var. gerontogea, commonly known as the golden vine, is a deciduous climbing shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vigorous growth and distinctive yellow-orange bark that becomes more pronounced with age. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by orange to red berries that are edible but have a strong, musky flavor. Its leaves are ovate with a rough texture and are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The golden vine is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique aesthetic features."
