    "intro": "Mammea humilis, commonly known as the dwarf mammea, is a small, shrub-like plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Clusiaceae family, also known as the guttiferae family, and is characterized by its smooth, often aromatic bark. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by bright red berries that are edible but have a strong, sometimes unpleasant taste. Its leaves are typically elliptical and have a glossy surface, while its roots are valued in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
