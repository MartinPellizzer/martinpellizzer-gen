    "intro": "Mimulus bhutanicus, commonly known as the Bhutan yellow monkeyflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Bhutan. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors and rocky stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. Mimulus bhutanicus plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators like bees and butterflies."
