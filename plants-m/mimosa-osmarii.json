    "intro": "Mimosa osmarii, commonly known as the silky mimosa, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by light or mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, grayish seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its soft, feathery appearance and drought tolerance."
