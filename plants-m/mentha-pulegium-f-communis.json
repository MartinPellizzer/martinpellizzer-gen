    "intro": "Mentha pulegium f. communis, commonly known as water mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, characterized by its square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in moist environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a strong, mint-like scent due to the presence of menthol and other essential oils. The flowers are small, tubular, and usually purple or blue, arranged in whorled clusters."
