    "intro": "Milium nigrum, commonly known as black millet, is an annual grass species native to Asia. It is characterized by its small, dark-colored grains that are typically used as a food source in some regions. The plant has slender, branched stems and produces clusters of tiny, spike-like flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Due to its hardy nature, it is often cultivated for both its nutritional value and ornamental appeal."
