    "intro": "Miconia tetrandra, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit tree, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into distinctive, star-shaped fruits. Miconia tetrandra is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive spread and ecological impact."
