    "intro": "Mammillaria pfeifferi var. fulvispina, commonly known as the yellow-spined hedgehog cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features dense, cylindrical spines that are typically yellow to golden in color, giving it its common name. The plant has a smooth, pale green body with prominent areoles from which both spines and flowers emerge. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, blooming in late spring or early summer. It is a slow-growing species that prefers well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
