    "intro": "Miconia thaminantha, commonly known as the golden miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silver-white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom throughout the wet season. Its fruits are berry-like, turning from green to reddish as they mature. Miconia thaminantha is known for its rapid growth and has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming invasive."
