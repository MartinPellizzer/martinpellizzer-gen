    "intro": "Maclura excelsa, commonly known as the yellow wood or devil's tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, light-colored bark and alternate, pinnately compound leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by orange to red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Maclura excelsa is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
