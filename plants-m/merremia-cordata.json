    "intro": "Merremia cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover in gardens. The seeds are dispersed by animals and can germinate readily under favorable conditions."
