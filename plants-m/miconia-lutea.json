    "intro": "Miconia lutea, commonly known as the yellow miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, glossy leaves and clusters of yellow-orange flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically dispersed by birds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
