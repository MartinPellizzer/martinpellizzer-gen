    "intro": "Microlepia grandissima, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its spores are produced in sporangia clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Microlepia grandissima is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks."
