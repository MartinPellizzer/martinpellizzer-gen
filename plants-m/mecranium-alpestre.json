    "intro": "Mecranium alpestre, commonly known as the alpine mecranium, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Mediterranean and Central Asia. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps protect it from harsh alpine conditions. Mecranium alpestre is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
