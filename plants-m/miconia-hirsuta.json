    "intro": "Miconia hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy miconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers, which are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are typically arranged oppositely on the stems and have a rough, textured surface. Miconia hirsuta is known for its rapid growth and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
