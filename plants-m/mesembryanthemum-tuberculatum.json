    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum tuberculatum, commonly known as the African daisy, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, ribbed leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to store water in its leaves makes it drought-tolerant and suitable for low-maintenance gardening."
