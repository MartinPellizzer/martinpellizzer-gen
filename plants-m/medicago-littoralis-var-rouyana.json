    "intro": "Medicago littoralis var. rouyana, commonly known as the coastal medick, is a perennial legume native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along shorelines and dunes. The plant has small, trifoliate leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. It is well adapted to coastal environments due to its salt tolerance and deep root system. This variety plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
