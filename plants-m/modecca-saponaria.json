    "intro": "Modecca saponaria, commonly known as soapwort, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are slightly hairy and arranged alternately along the stems. Its roots contain saponins, which produce a soapy lather when mixed with water, giving it its common name. Modecca saponaria is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or hedgerow environments."
