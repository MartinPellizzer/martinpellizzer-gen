    "intro": "Marsilea muscosa, commonly known as water clover, is a small aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its floating leaves that resemble four-leaf clovers, with each leaflet having a tiny air pocket to help it float. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its life cycle includes a free-floating gametophyte stage and a submerged sporophyte stage. Marsilea muscosa plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms."
