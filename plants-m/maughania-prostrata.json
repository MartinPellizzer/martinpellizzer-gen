It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that typically forms a dense mat of foliage. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pale yellow to orange in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its compact growth habit, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening for ground cover."
