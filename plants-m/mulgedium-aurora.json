    "intro": "Mulgedium aurora, commonly known as the Dawn's Bloom, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes. It features striking, bioluminescent petals that glow faintly in the dark, a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant's leaves are broad and waxy, designed to retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its flowering season occurs only during the summer solstice, making it a symbol of fleeting beauty. Botanists are particularly interested in its genetic makeup due to its unusual light-emitting properties."
