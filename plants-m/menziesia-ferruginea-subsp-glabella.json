    "intro": "Menziesia ferruginea subsp. glabella, commonly known as the glabrous leatherleaf, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, leathery leaves that are typically glabrous, or smooth, hence its subspecific name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by dark, leathery berries. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, forested environments. This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance in its native habitat."
