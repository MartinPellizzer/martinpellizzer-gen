    "intro": "Mucuna nigra, commonly known as black velvet bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, velvety pods that contain numerous small, elongated seeds. The plant has trifoliate leaves and produces flowers that range from white to purple in color. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Mucuna nigra is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of protein-rich seeds."
