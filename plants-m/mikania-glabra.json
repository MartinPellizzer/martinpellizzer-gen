    "intro": "Mikania glabra, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a tropical annual herb native to the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by oval, winged fruits. It is often found in disturbed soils and can become invasive in certain regions. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common weed in agricultural and natural settings."
