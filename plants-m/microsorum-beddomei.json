    "intro": "Microsorum beddomei, commonly known as the Beddome's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in shaded, nutrient-rich habitats. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water surface, contributing to water clarity by filtering out debris. Microsorum beddomei is valued in aquascaping for its aesthetic appeal and ability to create a natural, lush underwater landscape."
