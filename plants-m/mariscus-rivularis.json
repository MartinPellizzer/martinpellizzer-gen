    "intro": "Mariscus rivularis, commonly known as the river marshweed, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marshy environments in Europe. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often along the edges of rivers and streams. The plant has slender, erect stems with small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often floating on the water surface or partially submerged. Mariscus rivularis plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and provides habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
