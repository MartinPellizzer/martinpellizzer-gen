    "intro": "Mikania stuebelii, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a vigorous perennial vine native to the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences, followed by elliptical, winged seeds. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils. Due to its invasive nature, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
