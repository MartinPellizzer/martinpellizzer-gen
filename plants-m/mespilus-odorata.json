    "intro": "Mespilus odorata, commonly known as the European medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe. It produces small, edible fruits that are typically harvested when partially ripe, as they continue to soften and develop flavor after picking. The plant has a distinctive, gnarled appearance with dark green, oval-shaped leaves and fragrant, white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its fruit is characterized by a tough, leathery exterior and a sweet, aromatic pulp when fully mature. The medlar is also valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
