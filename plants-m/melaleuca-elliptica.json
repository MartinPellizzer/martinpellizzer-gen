    "intro": "Melaleuca elliptica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia, where it typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous inner layer, and its narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Melaleuca elliptica is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
