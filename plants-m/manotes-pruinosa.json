    "intro": "Manotes pruinosa, commonly known as the silverleaf manotes, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-white, velvety foliage, which provides a striking visual contrast to its deep green stems and leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, blooming in spring. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along canyon walls. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a notable species in xerophytic landscapes."
