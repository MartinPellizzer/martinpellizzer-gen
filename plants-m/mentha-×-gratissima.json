It is a cross between Mentha viridiflora and Mentha suaveolens, resulting in a plant that combines the characteristics of both parents. The plant produces opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a serrated margin. It blooms with small, pale blue or violet flowers that appear in whorls along the stems. Mentha \u00d7 gratissima is valued for its aromatic leaves and is often used in culinary and medicinal applications."
