    "intro": "Medicago turbinata subvar. oliviformis, commonly known as the oliveleaf medick, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with a distinctive olive-green hue, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical heads, typical of the Fabaceae family. Its root system is well-developed, allowing it to thrive in dry, rocky soils. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation and soil stabilization."
