It is a small, mat-forming perennial that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces delicate white or pale yellow flowers with four petals, which bloom in early spring. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is often found in alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
