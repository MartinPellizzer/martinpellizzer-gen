    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 dumetorum f. periopta, commonly known as the woolly mint, is a hybrid plant that exhibits a distinctive appearance due to its dense, white to gray pubescence covering the stems and leaves. It is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on both surfaces. Its flowers are small, tubular, and typically violet to purple in color, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in herbal teas, though it is less commonly cultivated than other mint species."
