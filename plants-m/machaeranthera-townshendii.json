    "intro": "Machaeranthera townshendii, commonly known as Townsend's blazingstar, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces showy yellow to orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments."
