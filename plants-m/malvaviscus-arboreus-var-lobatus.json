    "intro": "Malvaviscus arboreus var. lobatus, commonly known as the Mexican flame flower, is a tropical shrub native to Central America and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its striking, velvety red bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink and red, often blooming year-round in suitable conditions. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade. The species is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like hummingbirds and butterflies."
