    "intro": "Myrtus ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf myrtle, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are often aromatic. The plant produces tiny white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. Myrtus ovalifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in perfumery and traditional medicine."
