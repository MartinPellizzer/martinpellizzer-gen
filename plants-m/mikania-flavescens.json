    "intro": "Mikania flavescens, commonly known as yellow Mikania, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, yellowish-green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and forest edges, where it can spread rapidly. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions."
