    "intro": "Mentha glomerata var. sativa, commonly known as peppermint, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, dark green, slightly hairy leaves and its distinctive square, branched stems. The plant produces small, pale purple flowers that bloom in whorls along the stem. Peppermint is known for its high menthol content, which contributes to its cooling and menthol-like fragrance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and is often cultivated for its essential oils and culinary uses."
