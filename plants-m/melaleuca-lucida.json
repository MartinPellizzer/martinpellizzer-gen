    "intro": "Melaleuca lucida, commonly known as the candlebush, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia, where it typically grows in coastal areas and sand dunes. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Melaleuca lucida is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soils."
