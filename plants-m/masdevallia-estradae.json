    "intro": "Masdevallia estradae, commonly known as the Estrada's masdevallia, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, often colorful floral structure. The plant typically grows as a miniature epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually small but highly ornate, featuring intricate patterns and vivid hues that attract specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
