    "intro": "Macaranga praestans, commonly known as the silverleaf macaranga, is a fast-growing shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth rate, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
