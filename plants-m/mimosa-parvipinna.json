    "intro": "Mimosa parvipinna, commonly known as the small-leaf mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant is known for its sensitive response to touch, causing the leaves to fold shut when disturbed. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to bloom throughout the growing season."
