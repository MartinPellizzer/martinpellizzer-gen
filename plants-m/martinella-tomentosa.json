    "intro": "Martinella tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly Martinella, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its hairy, or tomentose, foliage and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests or undergrowth. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it remains relatively rare in horticultural trade."
