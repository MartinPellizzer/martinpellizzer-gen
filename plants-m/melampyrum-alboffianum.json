    "intro": "Melampyrum alboffianum, commonly known as white touchgrass, is a flowering plant in the family Orobanchaceae. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often found in temperate regions of Europe and Asia."
