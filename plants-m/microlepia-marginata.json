    "intro": "Microlepia marginata, commonly known as the broad-leafed chain fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its large, pinnately divided fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The fronds are typically green with a distinctive margin that is often curled or wavy, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
