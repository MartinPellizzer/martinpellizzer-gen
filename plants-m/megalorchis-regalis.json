    "intro": "Megalorchis regalis, commonly known as the royal orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 inches in diameter, making it one of the largest orchids in the world. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually a vibrant mix of white, pink, and purple, with intricate patterns that attract specific pollinators. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
