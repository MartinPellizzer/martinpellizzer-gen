    "intro": "Monochaetum vulcanicum f. costaricense, commonly known as the Costa Rican fire fern, is a rare and striking plant native to the volcanic regions of Costa Rica. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, grassy leaves. The plant is notable for its unique inflorescence, which consists of dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
