    "intro": "Microstegium fasciculatum, commonly known as the clustered wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Microstegium fasciculatum is often found in forest understories and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
