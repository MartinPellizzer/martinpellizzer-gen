    "intro": "Mahernia nana, commonly known as the dwarf mahernia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue in color. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit with dark green, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Mahernia nana thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in alpine gardens."
