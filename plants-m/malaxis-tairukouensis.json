    "intro": "Malaxis tairukouensis, commonly known as the Tairukou orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the spring season. The plant typically grows on tree branches or rocks, anchoring itself with its aerial roots. It has lance-shaped leaves that are usually clustered at the base of the plant. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
