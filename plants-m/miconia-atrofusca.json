    "intro": "Miconia atrofusca, commonly known as black miconia, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. Miconia atrofusca is often found in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests and secondary growth areas. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it an invasive species in some regions."
