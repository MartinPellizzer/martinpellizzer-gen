    "intro": "Macrolobium caudiculatum, commonly known as the Cape tulip, is a strikingly beautiful plant native to South Africa. It is a bulbous plant that produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are long and strap-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The Cape tulip is well-suited for rock gardens and dry landscapes due to its drought tolerance and vibrant blooms."
