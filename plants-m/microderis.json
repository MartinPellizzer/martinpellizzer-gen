    "intro": "Microderis, commonly known as the narrowleaf microderis, is a small, flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tubular flowers that are typically pale purple or white, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Microderis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
