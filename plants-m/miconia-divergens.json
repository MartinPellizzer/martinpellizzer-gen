    "intro": "Miconia divergens, commonly known as the Brazilian star apple, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers followed by large, edible fruits that resemble a star. Miconia divergens is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive spread and ecological impact."
