    "intro": "Muhlenbergia huegelii, commonly known as the desert muhlenbergia, is a warm-season grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces fluffy, bottlebrush-like seed heads that are often pink to red in color, adding ornamental value to landscapes. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its ability to form dense clumps makes it an effective ground cover in arid environments."
