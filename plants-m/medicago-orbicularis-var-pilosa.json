    "intro": "Medicago orbicularis var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy globe vetch, is a perennial legume characterized by its rounded, orbicular leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. It produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by cylindrical, dehiscent pods containing several seeds. The plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained soils, often found in disturbed or dry habitats. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with Rhizobia bacteria. Its hairy foliage and compact growth habit make it a distinctive and ecologically valuable species in its native environment."
