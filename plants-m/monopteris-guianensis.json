    "intro": "Monopteris guianensis, commonly known as the Guianan shield fern, is a tropical fern native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows on moist, shaded forest floors and thrives in humid, warm climates. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of rhizome scales, which help in water retention. The fronds are bioluminescent in some species, though this trait is less common in M. guianensis."
