    "intro": "Melandrium taimyrense, commonly known as the Taimyrenne catchfly, is a rare and endemic species native to the Arctic regions of Russia. It is a low-growing herbaceous plant with small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy, linear leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh, cold climates of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
