    "intro": "Mikania microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces numerous small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the morning. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
