    "intro": "Mammillaria pretiosa, commonly known as the Precious Mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is a small, globular plant with a ribbed structure and typically features white or pale yellow flowers. The plant has a dense covering of fine, white hairs, which help protect it from intense sunlight and dehydration. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its compact size and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
