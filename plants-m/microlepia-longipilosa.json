It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Microlepia longipilosa thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation."
