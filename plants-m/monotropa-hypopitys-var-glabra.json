    "intro": "Monotropa hypopitys var. glabra, commonly known as ghost plant, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host trees for nutrients. It is native to eastern North America and is often found in shaded, moist forest understories. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often remain evergreen throughout the year. The species is notable for its unique ecological role and its association with specific fungal networks that aid in nutrient absorption."
