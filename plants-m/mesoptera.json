    "intro": "Mesoptera, commonly known as the false nettle, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Urticaceae. These plants are characterized by their opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often hairy and have a rough texture. They typically produce small, greenish or yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. Mesoptera species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are often found in woodland edges or moist habitats. The plant contains stinging hairs, similar to true nettles, which can cause skin irritation upon contact."
