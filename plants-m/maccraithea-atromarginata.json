    "intro": "Maccraithea atromarginata, commonly known as the black-margin maccraithea, is a unique species belonging to the family Acanthaceae. It is characterized by its striking dark purple margins on its lance-shaped leaves, which contrast with its lighter green central veins. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in clusters, typically in shades of violet and white, which bloom during the warmer months. Native to specific regions in southern Africa, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
