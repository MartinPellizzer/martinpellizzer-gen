    "intro": "Milium sparsum, commonly known as the scattered millet, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant produces numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds that allow it to colonize disturbed soils and thrive in harsh environments. Milium sparsum typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, rocky areas, and along roadsides. Its resilience and adaptability make it an important component of desert ecosystems."
