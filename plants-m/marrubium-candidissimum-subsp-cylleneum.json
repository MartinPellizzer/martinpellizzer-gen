    "intro": "Marrubium candidissimum subsp. cylleneum, commonly known as the white horehound, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its hairy, grey-green foliage and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their mild antispasmodic and expectorant properties. The subspecies cylleneum is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and slightly different floral morphology compared to other members of the species."
