    "intro": "Mimosa amambayensis var. amambayensis, commonly known as the Amambay mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Paraguay. It features pinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a characteristic known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its bark is smooth and grayish, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and birds."
