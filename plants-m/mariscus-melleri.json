    "intro": "Mariscus melleri, commonly known as the coastal bladderwort, is a halophytic plant adapted to grow in saline environments. It is a small, herbaceous plant with succulent leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in coastal and estuarine areas. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system is specialized for absorbing nutrients from the mineral-rich soils of its habitat. Mariscus melleri plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for microorganisms."
