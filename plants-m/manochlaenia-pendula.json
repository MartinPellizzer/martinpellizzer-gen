It is characterized by its pendulous inflorescences that bear clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments.

The flowers, which range in color from white to pale pink, are notable for their intricate structure and attract various pollinators."
