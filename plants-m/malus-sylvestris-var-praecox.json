    "intro": "Malus sylvestris var. praecox, commonly known as the early apple, is a wild species of apple native to Europe and western Asia. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters, featuring small, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible fruits that ripen in late summer. The fruit is typically small, tart, and has a rough, russet-colored skin. This variety is valued for its hardiness and is often used in the cultivation of domestic apple varieties."
