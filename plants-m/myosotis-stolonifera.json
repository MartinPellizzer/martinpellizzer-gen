    "intro": "Myosotis stolonifera, commonly known as the trailing forget-me-not, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of blue or purple flowers with five petals. The plant spreads via stolons, which are horizontal stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and slightly hairy, while its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. It prefers moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
