    "intro": "Minuartia mucronata, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It is a member of the Montiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and delicate, white or pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, often calcareous soils and is typically found in mountainous regions across Europe and Asia. Its compact growth habit and ability to withstand harsh conditions make it well adapted to its arid and cold habitats. Minuartia mucronata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in rock gardens."
