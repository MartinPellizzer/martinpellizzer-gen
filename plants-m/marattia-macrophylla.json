    "intro": "Marattia macrophylla, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a large, tree-like fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in strobila. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its unique structure and size make it a striking addition to botanical gardens and a subject of interest in plant taxonomy."
