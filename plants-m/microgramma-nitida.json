    "intro": "Microgramma nitida, commonly known as the silver lace fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rainforests or woodland areas. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture. The leaves are composed of small, needle-like pinnae that are arranged in a bipinnate pattern, contributing to its distinctive look."
