    "intro": "Masdevallia moyobambae, commonly known as the Moyobamba orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Peru. It is characterized by its intricate, showy flowers that display a mix of vibrant red, pink, and white hues. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, exhibiting an epiphytic growth habit. Its leaves are long and narrow, adapted to capture moisture from the humid air. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
