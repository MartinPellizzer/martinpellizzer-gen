    "intro": "Muhlenbergia pereilema, commonly known as the desert muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. Muhlenbergia pereilema is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
