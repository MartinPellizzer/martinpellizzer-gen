    "intro": "Marah macrocarpa var. major, commonly known as the giant castor bean, is a variant of the castor oil plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers and distinctive, spiny fruit capsules that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces toxic seeds containing ricin, making it potentially hazardous to humans and animals. It thrives in warm, tropical climates and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes. Its botanical features make it a striking addition to botanical gardens, though caution is advised due to its toxic properties."
