    "intro": "Medicago suffruticosa var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth medick, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces that become glabrous with age. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers followed by narrow, elongated pods containing small, round seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Medicago suffruticosa var. glabrescens is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen and its use in ecological restoration projects."
