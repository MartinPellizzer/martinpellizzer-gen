    "intro": "Merremia semisagitta subsp. tenuisecta, commonly known as the slender-leaf morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It features heart-shaped leaves that are finely divided, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, blooming during the day. Its rapid growth habit and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental use in gardens. However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not properly managed."
