    "intro": "Mangifera altissima, commonly known as the Chinese mango, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are dark green and glossy on the upper surface. The tree produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers, which eventually develop into sweet, fibrous fruits with a yellow-orange skin. The fruit is highly valued for its flavor and is often used in both culinary and medicinal applications. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
