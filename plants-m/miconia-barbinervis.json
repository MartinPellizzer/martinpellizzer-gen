    "intro": "Miconia barbinervis, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by dark purple, berry-like fruits. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of tropical environments. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural ecosystems."
