    "intro": "Muehlenbeckia hastifolia, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Australia. It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving the plant its distinctive appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in spring, followed by fluffy, pale brown seeds. This plant is well adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
