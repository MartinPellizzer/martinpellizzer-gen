    "intro": "Myoporum sandwicense, commonly known as the Hawaiian myoporum, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant is adapted to the dry, coastal conditions of its native habitat, with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native insects and birds. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside Hawaii, where it can outcompete native vegetation."
