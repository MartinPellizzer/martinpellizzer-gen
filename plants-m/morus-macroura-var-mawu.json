It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and dark green on the upper surface. The tree produces small, aggregate fruits that are often consumed by local wildlife and can be used in traditional practices. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has cultural significance in some African communities and is sometimes used for its fibrous bark."
