    "intro": "Macrotyloma stipulosum, commonly known as the slender cowpea, is a herbaceous legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features trifoliate leaves with stipules, and its flowers are typically pale yellow to white, arranged in racemes. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain edible seeds, which are rich in protein. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used as a forage crop or for soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species in both agricultural and ecological contexts."
