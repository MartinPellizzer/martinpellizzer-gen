    "intro": "Mimosa quadrivalvis var. urbaniana, commonly known as the urban mimosa, is a variant of the quadrivalvis mimosa, native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by the closing mechanism of its stipules. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom in the spring and are followed by bean-like pods. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with each leaflet being oval and slightly serrated. This species is adapted to a variety of soil types and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy and ornamental plant for garden landscapes."
