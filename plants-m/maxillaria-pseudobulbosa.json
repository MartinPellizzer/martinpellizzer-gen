    "intro": "Maxillaria pseudobulbosa, commonly known as the False Pseudobulb Orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features elongated, grass-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, violet to purple flowers with yellow markings, blooming during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
