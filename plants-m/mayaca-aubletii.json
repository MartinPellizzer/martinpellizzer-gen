    "intro": "Mayaca aubletii, commonly known as the Florida rain lily, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its strap-like, grass-like leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a short, stout rhizome that helps it spread vegetatively. Mayaca aubletii is often found in Florida and parts of Georgia, where it plays a role in wetland ecosystems."
