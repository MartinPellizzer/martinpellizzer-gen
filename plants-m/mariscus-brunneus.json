    "intro": "Mariscus brunneus, commonly known as the brown marsh thistle, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands and marshy areas of Europe. It features a robust, upright stem that can grow up to 1 meter in height, covered with coarse, rough hair. The plant produces large, spiny leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, with a distinctive heart-shaped base. Its flowers are yellow and appear in dense clusters, blooming from June to August. Mariscus brunneus plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in nutrient-rich, moist soils."
