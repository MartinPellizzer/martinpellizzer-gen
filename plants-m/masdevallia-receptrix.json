    "intro": "Masdevallia receptrix, commonly known as the receptive masdevallia, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Colombia and Ecuador. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate, often colorful flower structure. The plant typically produces small, elongated flowers with prominent sepals and petals, often in shades of pink, purple, and white. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, humid conditions and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
