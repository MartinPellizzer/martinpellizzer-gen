    "intro": "Macropsychanthus lauterbachii subsp. neobritannicus, commonly known as the Neobritannic ghost flower, is a rare and striking member of the Apocynaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with translucent, papery petals that resemble translucent tissue. The plant is native to specific regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive, almost ethereal glow. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens and conservation programs."
