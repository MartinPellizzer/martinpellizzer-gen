    "intro": "Myriophyllum longibracteolatum, commonly known as the long-bract watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to North America. It has whorled leaves that are typically narrow and pointed, with a smooth, dark green surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that float on the water surface, and it is often found in slow-moving freshwater environments. Myriophyllum longibracteolatum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. It is also sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions."
