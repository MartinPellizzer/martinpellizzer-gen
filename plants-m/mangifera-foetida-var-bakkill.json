    "intro": "Mangifera foetida var. bakkill, commonly known as the wild mango or bakkill mango, is a less commonly cultivated variety of the mango genus. It is native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly in regions of Indonesia and the Philippines. This plant is characterized by its large, elongated leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in the rainy season. The fruit is generally smaller and less sweet compared to commercial mango varieties, with a more fibrous texture. Due to its limited cultivation, it is often found in wild or semi-wild environments, contributing to local biodiversity."
