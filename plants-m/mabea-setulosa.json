    "intro": "Mabea setulosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf mabea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender stalks. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Mabea setulosa thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in humid lowland forests."
