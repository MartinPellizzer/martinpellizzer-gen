    "intro": "Mikania brachiata, commonly known as the creeping oxeye, is a vigorous climbing vine native to the Americas. It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, spiny seed capsules. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes. Mikania brachiata is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and forest edges, where it can become invasive."
