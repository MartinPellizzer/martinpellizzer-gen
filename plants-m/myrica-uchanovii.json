    "intro": "Myrica uchanovii, commonly known as the Uchanov's wax myrtle, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Myricaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, waxy leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. Myrica uchanovii thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its resilience to drought and salt makes it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
