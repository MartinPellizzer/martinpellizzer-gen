    "intro": "Marginaria rufula, commonly known as the rough hawksbeard, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are rough and hairy, giving it a distinctive texture, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Marginaria rufula is often found in grasslands and along roadsides, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
