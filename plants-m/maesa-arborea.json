    "intro": "Maesa arborea, commonly known as the tree hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, featuring glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow, red, and orange, typically blooming in spring and summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Maesa arborea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
