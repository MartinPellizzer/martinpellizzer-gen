    "intro": "Magnolia grandiflora var. lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf magnolia, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves and showy, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in USDA hardiness zones 6 through 9, preferring moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Its ornamental value comes from its large, cup-shaped blossoms and its ability to provide seasonal interest with its foliage. It is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits."
