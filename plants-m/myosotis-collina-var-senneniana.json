    "intro": "Myosotis collina var. senneniana, commonly known as the alpine forget-me-not, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, fuzzy layer, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high elevation or rocky landscapes."
