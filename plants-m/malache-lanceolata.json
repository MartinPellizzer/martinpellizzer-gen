    "intro": "Malache lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf malache, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically in shades of yellow or white, and are borne on erect stems. Malache lanceolata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
