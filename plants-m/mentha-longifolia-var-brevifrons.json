It features aromatic, narrow leaves with a distinctive minty fragrance, and its flowers are typically small and pale blue or purple. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. It has a creeping growth habit with rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense mats. This variety is valued for its culinary and medicinal uses, similar to other mint species."
