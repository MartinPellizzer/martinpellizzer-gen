    "intro": "Melampyrum arvense, commonly known as yellow lousewort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is native to Europe, Asia, and North America. Its yellow flowers bloom in late summer, and the plant has small, lance-shaped leaves. It is often found in open, sunny habitats and can form dense colonies in suitable conditions."
