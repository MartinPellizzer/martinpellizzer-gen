    "intro": "Malaxis apollinis, commonly known as the Apollo's orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces a single, slender stem with a few leaves. Its flowers are typically arranged in a loose cluster and are pollinated by specific insects. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Malaxis apollinis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
