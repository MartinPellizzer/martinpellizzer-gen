    "intro": "Malcolmia laxa, commonly known as the common moonflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom at night. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. Its flowers emit a sweet fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Malcolmia laxa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique blooming habit."
