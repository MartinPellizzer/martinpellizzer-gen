    "intro": "Mapania supervacuum, commonly known as the vacuum maple, is a rare and peculiar plant species characterized by its unique ability to thrive in near-vacuum conditions. Its leaves are thick and waxy, designed to minimize water loss in low-pressure environments. The plant produces small, pale blue flowers that bloom only under specific atmospheric conditions. Its root system is highly specialized, allowing it to anchor itself in rocky, low-oxygen soils. Due to its extreme environmental requirements, it is found only in a few isolated locations on Earth."
