    "intro": "Maxillaria corrugata, commonly known as the wrinkled maxillaria, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, velvety leaves. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with a contrasting purple lip. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Maxillaria corrugata is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
