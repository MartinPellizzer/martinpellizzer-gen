    "intro": "Micromeria echioides, commonly known as the desert star or coastal star, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, star-shaped yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as coastal dunes and sandy soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually small, narrow, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Micromeria echioides plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and provides habitat and nectar for pollinators."
