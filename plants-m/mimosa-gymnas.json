    "intro": "Mimosa gymnas, commonly known as the silky mimosa, is a shrub native to South America. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its leaves are sensitive to touch, curling up when disturbed, a trait that adds to its unique appeal."
