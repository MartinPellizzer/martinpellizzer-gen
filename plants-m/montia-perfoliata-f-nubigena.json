    "intro": "Montia perfoliata f. nubigena, commonly known as the cloud cushion moss, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces tiny, white to pale pink flowers that are clustered in small umbels, typical of the Montiaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or woodland areas. This variety is noted for its ability to form dense cushions, which help it retain moisture and withstand harsh environmental conditions."
