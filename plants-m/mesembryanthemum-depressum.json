    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum depressum, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a succulent species characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and clustered, small, often yellow or white flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations to drought and intense sunlight. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine, powdery coating that helps reduce water loss. Mesembryanthemum depressum is often found in sandy or rocky soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing desert ecosystems."
