    "intro": "Microlepia hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a hairy texture on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce multiple shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The spores are borne on the undersides of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
