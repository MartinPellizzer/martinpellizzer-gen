    "intro": "Marsilea vera, commonly known as water clover, is a aquatic fern that thrives in shallow, freshwater environments. It has small, floating leaves that resemble four-leaf clover, with each leaflet being oval-shaped and slightly overlapping. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that develop into bladder-like structures containing seeds. Marsilea vera is often found in ponds, marshes, and along the edges of streams. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through vegetative reproduction make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems."
