    "intro": "Mimosa daleoides, commonly known as the silver mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold when touched, a response known as thigmonasty. The plant produces small, spherical yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal, Mimosa daleoides is often cultivated in warmer climates."
