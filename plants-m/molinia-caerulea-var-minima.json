    "intro": "Molinia caerulea var. minima, commonly known as the dwarf moor grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wet meadows, bogs, and heathlands. Due to its compact size and ornamental appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual appeal and ecological benefits."
