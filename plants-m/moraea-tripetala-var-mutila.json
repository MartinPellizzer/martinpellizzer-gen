    "intro": "Moraea tripetala var. mutila, commonly known as the partial-leaved moraea, is a striking South African bulbous perennial plant belonging to the Iridaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, grass-like foliage and clusters of vivid, iris-like flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant features a bulbous base that stores nutrients, supporting its growth during dormant periods. Its flowers are often pale blue to purple, with intricate patterns that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variety is noted for its reduced leaf structure compared to the typical form, making it a unique and ornamental addition to gardens."
