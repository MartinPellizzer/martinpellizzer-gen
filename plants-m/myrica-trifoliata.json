    "intro": "Myrica trifoliata, commonly known as the wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its narrow, dark green leaves that are often coated with a waxy cuticle, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, berry-like fruits, which are an important food source for birds and wildlife. Myrica trifoliata thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and coastal areas. It is also valued for its aromatic wood and has been used historically by Native American communities for various purposes."
