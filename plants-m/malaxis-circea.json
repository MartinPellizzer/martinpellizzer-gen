    "intro": "Malaxis circea, commonly known as the small lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a dense, dark green foliage and produces a slender, twisting inflorescence with small, white or pale pink flowers. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to aid in nutrient absorption. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
