    "intro": "Moschoxylum cuneatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flax, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to dry, rocky habitats. Moschoxylum cuneatum is valued for its historical use in fiber production and its ornamental appeal in gardens."
