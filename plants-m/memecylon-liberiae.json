    "intro": "Memecylon liberiae, commonly known as the Liberian memecylon, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to West Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, simple leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in primary and secondary rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
