    "intro": "Monilaria microstigma, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed monilaria, is a species of lichen belonging to the family Verrucariaceae. It is characterized by its crustose thallus, which adheres tightly to the substrate, often found on soil, bark, or rock surfaces. The lichen's morphology includes a dark, almost black, upper cortex with a lighter, powdery lower cortex. It produces apothecia that are typically small and disc-shaped, bearing ascospores that are ellipsoidal in shape. This species is often found in temperate regions and is used in ecological studies to monitor environmental conditions."
