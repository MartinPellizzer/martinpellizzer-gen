    "intro": "Melica cupani var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf bottlebrush grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and distinctive, bottlebrush-like inflorescences that are typically pink to reddish in color. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for use in xeriscaping and as a ornamental plant in dryland gardens. Melica cupani var. humilis plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
