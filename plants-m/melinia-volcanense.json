    "intro": "Melinia volcanense, commonly known as the volcanic melinia, is a rare plant species native to high-altitude regions of volcanic areas. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its arid and nutrient-poor environment. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to absorb moisture from the thin soil layers of volcanic substrates. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Melinia volcanense is considered an indicator species of volcanic ecosystems."
