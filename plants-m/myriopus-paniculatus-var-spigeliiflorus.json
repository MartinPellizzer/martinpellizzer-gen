    "intro": "Myriopus paniculatus var. spigeliiflorus, commonly known as the spike-leaved myriopus, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive spike-like inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland dune environments. Its flowering period occurs during the warmer months, and it produces small, spikelet-like flowers that are adapted for wind pollination. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
