    "intro": "Mimosa serpens var. glabrifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf sensitiveplant, is a variant of the sensitiveplant species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and bipinnate leaves that fold when touched, a response triggered by touch-sensitive hairs. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate to high levels of sunlight. Due to its delicate appearance and responsive behavior, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens and greenhouses."
