    "intro": "Marcetia mucugensis, commonly known as the Peruvian bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Peru. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and is adapted to the cool, temperate climate of its native habitat. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss. Marcetia mucugensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
