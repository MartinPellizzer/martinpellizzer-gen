    "intro": "Micropus multicaulis, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub with slender, branching stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Micropus multicaulis is adapted to survive in harsh conditions, making it an important component of desert ecosystems."
