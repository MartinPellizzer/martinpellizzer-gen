    "intro": "Mucuna calophylla, commonly known as the velvet bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and trifoliate leaves, which contribute to its ornamental appeal. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by elongated pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. It is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, enriching the soil. However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
