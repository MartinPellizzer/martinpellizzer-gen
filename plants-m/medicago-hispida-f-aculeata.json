    "intro": "Medicago hispida f. aculeata, commonly known as the prickly medick, is a low-growing leguminous plant characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, trifoliate leaves. It produces yellow pea-like flowers and cylindrical, spiny pods that contain several seeds. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. The plant is also valued for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
