    "intro": "Medicago rigidula var. lamottei, commonly known as the lamotte's goat's rue, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in summer, followed by pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated as a forage plant or in ornamental gardens."
