    "intro": "Muscari grandifolium var. rifanum, commonly known as the Rif musk grape, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of North Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its flowers emit a strong, musky fragrance, which attracts pollinators like bees and flies. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
