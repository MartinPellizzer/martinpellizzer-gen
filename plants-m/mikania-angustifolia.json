    "intro": "Mikania angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf morning glory, is a climbing vine native to the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple, blooming in the early morning. It is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and riverbanks. Mikania angustifolia is also noted for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets."
