It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in whorled clusters during the summer months. Its essential oils, rich in menthol and other volatile compounds, contribute to its distinctive cooling effect and medicinal properties. This variety is often used in aromatherapy and traditional herbal remedies due to its therapeutic benefits."
