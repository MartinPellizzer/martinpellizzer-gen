    "intro": "Mabea glauca, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring upright stems covered in soft, silvery-blue foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers in clusters during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a fuzzy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Mabea glauca is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic value and ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun conditions."
