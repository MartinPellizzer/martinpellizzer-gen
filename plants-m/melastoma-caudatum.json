It is a shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and understoreys. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are small, clustered, and usually pink or white, with five petals. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in natural habitats."
