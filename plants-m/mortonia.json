    "intro": "Mortonia, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a unique species found in specific ecological niches. It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent leaves and stems that appear to glow faintly in low light. The plant contains a toxic alkaloid called mortonine, which has been studied for its potential medicinal properties. Mortonia thrives in moist, shaded environments, often near water sources. Its unusual appearance and chemical composition make it both fascinating and dangerous to handle."
