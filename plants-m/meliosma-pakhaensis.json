    "intro": "Meliosma pakhaensis, commonly known as the Pakhan Mountains meliosma, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Greater Caucasus. It belongs to the family Saururaceae and is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas with rich, well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and taxonomic studies in the region."
