    "intro": "Mahonia hypoleuca, commonly known as the silverleaf mahonia, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically gray-green in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in upright panicles. These flowers are followed by blue-black berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. Mahonia hypoleuca is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
