    "intro": "Maytenus communis var. grandifolia, commonly known as the large-leaved mayten, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its elongated, lanceolate leaves that are often larger than those of the typical Maytenus communis. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing elliptical seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. Its botanical features make it a notable species in ecological studies and traditional medicine."
