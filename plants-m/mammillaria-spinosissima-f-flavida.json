    "intro": "Mammillaria spinosissima f. flavida, commonly known as the yellow-flowered mammillaria, is a compact cactus with a spherical or slightly elongated stem. It features dense, cylindrical spines that are typically yellow or pale green, contrasting with its pale green to bluish-gray body. The plant produces small, showy flowers that range from yellow to orange, often appearing in late spring or early summer. It is native to Mexico and thrives in well-draining soil with minimal water. This variety is prized for its unique coloration and is relatively easy to care for in a sunny, arid environment."
