    "intro": "Mariscus cearaensis, commonly known as the Ceara marshmallow, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of northeastern Brazil. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its soft, woolly leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in saline or brackish wetlands, adapting to the high salt content in its environment. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various small organisms. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
