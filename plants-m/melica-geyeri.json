    "intro": "Melica geyeri, commonly known as Geyer's brome, is a species of grass native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Melica geyeri thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities in its native range."
