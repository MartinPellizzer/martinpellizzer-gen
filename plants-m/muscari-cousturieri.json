    "intro": "Muscari cousturieri, commonly known as the Corsican musk garlic, is a bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet. The plant produces a strong, aromatic scent reminiscent of musk, which is a key feature of its common name. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Muscari cousturieri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize in suitable environments."
