    "intro": "Melanthium garnotianum, commonly known as the Garnot's meadowrue, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the buttercup family (Ranunculaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, loamy soils. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations. Melanthium garnotianum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in native plant gardens."
