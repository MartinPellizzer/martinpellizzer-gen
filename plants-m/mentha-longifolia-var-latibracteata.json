    "intro": "Mentha longifolia var. latibracteata, commonly known as narrow-leaved mint, is a variant of the mint family (Lamiaceae) characterized by its slender, elongated leaves. It is native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in whorled clusters, typical of the mint genus. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, making it useful in culinary and medicinal applications. However, it is less commonly cultivated than other mint varieties due to its specific growing requirements."
