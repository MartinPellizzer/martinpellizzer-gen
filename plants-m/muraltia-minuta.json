    "intro": "Muraltia minuta, commonly known as the dwarf muraltia, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters, featuring dense, leathery leaves that are usually elliptical or oval in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, round, red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for ornamental gardening. Its compact size and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for hedges and container planting."
