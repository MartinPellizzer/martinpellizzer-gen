    "intro": "Medinilla humblotii, commonly known as the velvet tangerine. This evergreen shrub is native to the Philippines and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Medinilla humblotii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and floral display."
