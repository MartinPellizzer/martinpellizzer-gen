It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often toothed or serrated. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers arranged in whorls along the stem, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as stream sides and wet meadows. Mentha aquatica var. denticulata is known for its aromatic, cooling scent and has been used historically in herbal medicine."
