    "intro": "Medicago tuberculata f. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent sickle vetch, is a perennial legume characterized by its hairy, pubescent stems and trifoliate leaves. It produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees. The plant is adapted to dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its seeds are small and oblong, with a hard coat that allows for effective seed dispersal. This variety is valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
