    "intro": "Mucuna glabrialata, commonly known as the hairy morning glory, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features palmate leaves with three to five leaflets and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple. The plant is characterized by its long, slender stems and tendrils that aid in its climbing growth habit. Its seeds are encased in a hard, spiny pod, and the plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates. Mucuna glabrialata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
