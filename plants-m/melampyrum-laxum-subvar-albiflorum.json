    "intro": "Melampyrum laxum subvar. albiflorum, commonly known as whiteflower betony, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. These flowers are arranged in spike-like inflorescences and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland edges and grassy areas."
