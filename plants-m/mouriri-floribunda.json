    "intro": "Mouriri floribunda, commonly known as the golden mouriri, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It features glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green with a slight pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible, orange-red berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes."
