    "intro": "Miconia antioquiensis, commonly known as the Antioquian miconia, is a shrub or small tree native to the cloud forests of western Colombia. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous small seeds. Due to habitat loss, Miconia antioquiensis is considered endangered and is of significant botanical interest for its unique morphology and ecological role."
