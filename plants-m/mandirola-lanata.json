    "intro": "Mandirola lanata, commonly known as the hairy mandirola, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and showy, woolly flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, this plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its fibrous roots help it retain moisture in dry environments, making it drought-tolerant. The plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
