It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is known for its aggressive growth habit, often forming dense mats that can smother other vegetation. Its stems are hairy and capable of twining around supports, while its roots can spread extensively, making it a challenging invasive species in some areas."
