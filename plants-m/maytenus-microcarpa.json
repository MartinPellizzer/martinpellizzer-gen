It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador. The plant is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, typically reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The small, yellowish flowers are clustered in inflorescences, and the fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release the seeds."
