    "intro": "Muhlenbergia ligulata, commonly known as the narrowleaf muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and produces delicate, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and moist meadows, preferring well-drained soils. Its fine texture and ability to form dense clumps make it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Muhlenbergia ligulata is also valued for its role in supporting local wildlife and its low maintenance requirements."
