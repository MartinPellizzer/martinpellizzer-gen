    "intro": "Megaclinium minus, commonly known as the lesser megaclinium, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in dry, sandy soils. It is native to parts of southern Europe and western Asia. Due to its low-growing habit, it is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in arid landscapes."
