    "intro": "Mimosa falconis, commonly known as the yellow mimosa, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by the plant's sensitive leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Mimosa falconis is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to withstand salt spray."
