    "intro": "Mammillaria fellneri, commonly known as the Fellner's nipple cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a distinctive appearance, featuring a ribbed stem and prominent white spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green body. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is often cultivated by enthusiasts for its ornamental value."
