    "intro": "Mimosa caffra, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Mimosa caffra is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
