    "intro": "Miconia dichroa, commonly known as the two-colored miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter green or even silver on the underside. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It is often found in moist, shaded areas of lowland forests and is known for its rapid growth and potential invasive tendencies in certain regions. Miconia dichroa is also notable for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and fruit."
