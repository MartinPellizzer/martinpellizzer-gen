    "intro": "Mentha subtomentosa, commonly known as the woolly mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Mentha subtomentosa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its aromatic leaves and flowers make it a valuable species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
