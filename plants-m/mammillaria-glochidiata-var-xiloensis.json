    "intro": "Mammillaria glochidiata var. xiloensis, commonly known as the Xiloense Hedgehog Cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a dense covering of white to pale yellow spines, which are often arranged in clusters. The plant produces pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It is well adapted to arid environments, with a shallow root system and a thick, water-storing stem. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
