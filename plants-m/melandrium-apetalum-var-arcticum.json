    "intro": "Melandrium apetalum var. arcticum, commonly known as the Arctic catchfly, is a flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions."
