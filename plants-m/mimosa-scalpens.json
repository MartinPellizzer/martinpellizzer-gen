    "intro": "Mimosa scalpens, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Mimosa scalpens is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique leaf movements and delicate appearance."
