    "intro": "Meiogyne lucida, commonly known as the shining banyan, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, showy flowers. The plant is often found growing in moist, tropical environments, such as along riverbanks and in dense forests. Its roots can form aerial roots that hang from the branches, which can eventually take root and create additional trunks, giving it a tree-like appearance. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and has cultural significance in some regions."
