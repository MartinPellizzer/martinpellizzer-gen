    "intro": "Moriera, commonly known as the Mexican elder or moringa, is a fast-growing, drought-resistant shrub native to the Indian subcontinent and parts of Africa. It belongs to the Moringaceae family and is characterized by its feathery leaves, yellow flowers, and long, slender pods. The plant is widely cultivated for its nutrient-rich leaves, which are used in traditional medicine and as a food source. Moriera thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a valuable plant for reforestation and sustainable agriculture."
