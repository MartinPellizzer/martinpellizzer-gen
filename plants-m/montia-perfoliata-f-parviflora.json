    "intro": "Montia perfoliata f. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered perfoliate speedwell, is a flowering plant in the family Montiaceae. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage. The leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Its flowers are small, white to pale blue, and clustered in racemes, blooming in late spring to early summer. This variety is distinguished by its reduced flower size compared to the typical form of Montia perfoliata."
