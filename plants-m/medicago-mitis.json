    "intro": "Medicago mitis, commonly known as the lesser medick, is a low-growing perennial legume native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It features small, trifoliate leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is characterized by its ability to thrive in poor soils and its tolerance to drought conditions. It is often found in grasslands, disturbed sites, and along roadsides. Medicago mitis plays a role in soil stabilization and can be used in ecological restoration projects."
