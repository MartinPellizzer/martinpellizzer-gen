    "intro": "Mimosa leiocephala, commonly known as the silky mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response known as thigmonastic movement. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The species is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
