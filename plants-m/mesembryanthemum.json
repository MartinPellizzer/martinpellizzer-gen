    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum, commonly known as the living stone or ice plant, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Aizoaceae. These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their succulent leaves and vibrant, daisy-like flowers. Many species are adapted to arid environments, storing water in their fleshy stems and leaves. They typically bloom in response to rainfall, often during the winter months. The genus includes over 200 species, many of which are popular in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value."
