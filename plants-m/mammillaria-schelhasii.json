    "intro": "Mammillaria schelhasii, commonly known as the Schelhas' prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a dense covering of white to pale blue spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, spherical fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water. Mammillaria schelhasii is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its ornamental appearance and low maintenance requirements."
