It belongs to the family Apiaceae, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant is known for its distinctive, finely divided leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its mycelial growth patterns are unique, contributing to its ecological significance in forest ecosystems. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Mycelis yunnanensis is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
