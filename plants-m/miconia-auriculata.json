It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that often have a distinctive auriculate (ear-shaped) base. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are typically borne in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a bright red, fleshy drupe that contains several seeds. Miconia auriculata is often found in moist, shaded habitats within tropical forests."
