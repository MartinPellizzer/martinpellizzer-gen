    "intro": "Masdevallia xerophila, commonly known as the dryland masdevallia, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often brightly colored flowers that bloom in the cooler months. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and high humidity, typically found in cloud forests. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native arid or semi-arid habitats. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is a challenging plant to cultivate outside its natural range."
