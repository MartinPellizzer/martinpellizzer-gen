    "intro": "Monstera modesta, commonly known as the Swiss cheese plant, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that develop fenestrations as they mature, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Its leaves can grow up to 12 inches in length, and it produces small, inconspicuous green flowers followed by black berries. Monstera modesta is popular as a houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
