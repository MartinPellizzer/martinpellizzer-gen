    "intro": "Maxillaria splendens, commonly known as the Splendid Maxillaria, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, yellow, and pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or other surfaces in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water to help it survive in dry periods. The flowers bloom in clusters and are often fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
