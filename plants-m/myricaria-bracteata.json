It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle, helping to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Myricaria bracteata is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various desert organisms."
