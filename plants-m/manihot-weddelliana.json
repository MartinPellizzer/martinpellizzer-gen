    "intro": "Manihot weddelliana, commonly known as the Weddell's manioc, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in complex inflorescences. Its roots are used in traditional medicine and as a source of starch, similar to other manioc species. However, the plant contains toxic compounds that require careful processing before consumption."
