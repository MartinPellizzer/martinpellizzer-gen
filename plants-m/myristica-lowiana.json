    "intro": "Myristica lowiana, commonly known as the Borneo nutmeg, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the island of Borneo. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, woody fruits that contain the spice nutmeg. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has compound leaves with long, narrow leaflets. Its fruit develops into a hard, rough-skinned capsule that splits open to release the aromatic seeds. The tree is valued for its economic importance in the spice trade, particularly for its nutmeg and mace."
