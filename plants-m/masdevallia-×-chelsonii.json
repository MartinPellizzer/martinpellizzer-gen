It is a hybrid between Masdevallia leucophaea and Masdevallia tenuifolia, resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parent species. The plant typically features elongated, strap-like leaves and produces showy, spurred flowers in shades of pink, red, and white. It thrives in cool, humid environments with indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is widely cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
