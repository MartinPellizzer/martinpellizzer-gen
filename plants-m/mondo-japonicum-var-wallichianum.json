It features dense, dark green foliage that forms a thick, carpet-like ground cover. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale blue flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to suppress weeds. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is a popular choice for erosion control and ornamental gardening."
