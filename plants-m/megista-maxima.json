    "intro": "Megista maxima, commonly known as the giant spider orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the rainforests of northeastern Australia. This plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 centimeters in length, featuring a distinctive spider-like appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or in dense undergrowth. The plant's unique morphology and vibrant coloration make it a notable species in botanical studies. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
