    "intro": "Murdannia terminalis, commonly known as the tropical water plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Commelinaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit. The plant typically features slender, branching stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the water's surface or substrate. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish-white in color and are followed by distinctive, three-lobed seed capsules. Murdannia terminalis is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes."
