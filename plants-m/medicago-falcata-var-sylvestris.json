    "intro": "Medicago falcata var. sylvestris, commonly known as the wild alfalfa or goat's rue, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Europe. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a deep taproot system, allowing it to thrive in dry, rocky soils. It is often found in open woodlands and grasslands, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation. Its seeds are small and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
