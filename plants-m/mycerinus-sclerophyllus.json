    "intro": "Mycerinus sclerophyllus, commonly known as the coastal wattle, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid and saline environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in spikes and attract various pollinators. Its woody structure and dense growth habit make it well-suited for stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion. Mycerinus sclerophyllus is an important species in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to thrive in harsh coastal conditions."
