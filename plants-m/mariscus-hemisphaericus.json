    "intro": "Mariscus hemisphaericus, commonly known as the globe mallow, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive globe-shaped flower heads, which are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, helping to reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Mariscus hemisphaericus is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant in xeriscaped gardens."
