    "intro": "Mertensia emarginata, commonly known as bluebells, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its striking clusters of bell-shaped, blue-violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has heart-shaped, aromatic leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. Mertensia emarginata is a valuable early-season nectar source for pollinators like bees and butterflies."
