    "intro": "Mariscus cladium, commonly known as the marsh clubmoss, is a small evergreen shrub native to wetland environments in North America. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its creeping growth habit and dense clusters of needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are typically found at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs and swampy areas. Due to its ecological importance, it plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
