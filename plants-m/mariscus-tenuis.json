    "intro": "Mariscus tenuis, commonly known as the slender marsh clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like leaves that grow in whorls around the stem. This plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and forest floors. Mariscus tenuis has a simple, dichotomous branching pattern, which is a defining feature of the clubmosses. Its reproductive structures, known as strobila, are cone-like and contain spores, contributing to its role in the ecological cycle of its habitat."
