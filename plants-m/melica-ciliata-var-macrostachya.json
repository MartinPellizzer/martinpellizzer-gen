    "intro": "Melica ciliata var. macrostachya, commonly known as the broad-stalked beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with finely serrated edges. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and woodland edges. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and habitat restoration projects."
