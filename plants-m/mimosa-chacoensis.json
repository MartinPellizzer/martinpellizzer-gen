    "intro": "Mimosa chacoensis, commonly known as the Chaco mimosa, is a deciduous shrub native to South America, particularly found in Argentina, Paraguay, and Bolivia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response known as thigmonastic movement. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in dry grasslands and shrublands. Due to its unique adaptations, it plays an important ecological role in its native habitat."
