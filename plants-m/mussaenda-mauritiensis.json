    "intro": "Mussaenda mauritiensis, commonly known as the Mauritius Mussaenda, is a flowering plant native to the island of Mauritius. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, clustered inflorescences of bright yellow or orange flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly the Mauritius kestrel, making it an important component of the island's ecosystem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
