    "intro": "Meniscium lineatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved meniscium, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Meniscium lineatum is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported diuretic and antispasmodic properties."
