    "intro": "Mentha arvensis var. villosa, commonly known as field mint or woolly mint, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and a strong, aromatic scent. The plant typically grows in moist soils and can be found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas. Its square, often hairy stems are usually purple-tinged, and it produces small, tubular flowers that are pale blue to purple in color. This variety is closely related to other mint species and is often used in traditional herbal medicine."
