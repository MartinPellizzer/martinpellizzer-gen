    "intro": "Maxillaria chrysocycnoides, commonly known as the golden cycnoid maxillaria, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, tropical environments. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and covered in a dense layer of roots, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The flowers bloom in clusters, often appearing in late spring or early summer, making it a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts."
