    "intro": "Monophyllaea horsfieldii, commonly known as the Horsfield's monophyllaea, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its striking blue or violet bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal regions. It has a short lifespan, blooming only once before dying, which makes it a rare and ephemeral species. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
