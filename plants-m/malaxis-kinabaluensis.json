    "intro": "Malaxis kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Bornean ghost orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to the high-altitude rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-yellow flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on tree trunks and branches, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to the humid, shaded conditions of its habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
