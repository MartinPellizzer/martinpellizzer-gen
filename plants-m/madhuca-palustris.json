It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, shady environments, often found in swampy or wetland areas. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
