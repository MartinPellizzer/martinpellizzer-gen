    "intro": "Melica mutica, commonly known as silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, silky hairs that cover the leaves and stems, giving it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and wet meadows, and thrives in temperate climates. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, blue-green spikelets. Melica mutica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
