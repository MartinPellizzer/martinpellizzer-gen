    "intro": "Merremia retusa, commonly known as the silverleaf morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features heart-shaped leaves with a silvery underside, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, blooming in the morning. Its roots are fibrous and can be used in traditional medicine. The plant is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and waste lands, due to its adaptability and rapid growth."
