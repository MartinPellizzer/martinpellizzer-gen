    "intro": "Melaleuca lophocoracorum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia, particularly Queensland and New South Wales, where it thrives in coastal and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous inner layer, and its narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically visited by nectar-feeding insects and birds. The narrow-leaf paperbark is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types."
