    "intro": "Minuartia tenuifolia var. arvatica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features small, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its compact form and drought tolerance make it a hardy addition to xeriscapes and rock gardens."
