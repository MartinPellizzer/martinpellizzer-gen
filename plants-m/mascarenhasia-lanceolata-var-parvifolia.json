    "intro": "Mascarenhasia lanceolata var. parvifolia, commonly known as the Mascarene dwarf lantana, is a species native to the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean. It is a shrub characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and well-drained soils. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat for native insects and birds. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
