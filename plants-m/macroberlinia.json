    "intro": "Macroberlinia, commonly known as the giant sycamore, is a large, deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its broad, palmately lobed leaves. The tree produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that appear in clusters, followed by long, pod-like fruits. Its bark is thick and deeply fissured, providing a rugged appearance. Macroberlinia is valued for its hard, durable wood and its role in traditional medicine."
