It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in humid, well-drained environments. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
