    "intro": "Micrandra, commonly known as the small-fruit sandmat, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its upright, often branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Micrandra species are native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. These plants are adapted to harsh environments and play a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
