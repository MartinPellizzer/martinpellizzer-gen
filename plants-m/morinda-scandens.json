    "intro": "Morinda scandens, commonly known as the climbing morinda, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is a woody vine that can grow up to several meters in length, characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and showy clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are often orange-red in color, containing seeds surrounded by a sticky pulp. Morinda scandens is often found in shaded or semi-shaded areas in forests, climbing on trees or shrubs. It is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
