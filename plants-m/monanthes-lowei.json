    "intro": "Monanthes lowei, commonly known as the Hawaiian moonflower, is a flowering plant native to the island of Maui in Hawaii. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, and its flowers emit a sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators like moths. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas and forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation laws."
