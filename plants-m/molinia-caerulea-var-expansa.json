    "intro": "Molinia caerulea var. expansa, commonly known as the broadleaf moor grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, acidic soils, often found in peat bogs and heathlands. The plant produces tall, spike-like inflorescences that bear small blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically broad and flat, with a bluish-green color that becomes more pronounced in the autumn. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
