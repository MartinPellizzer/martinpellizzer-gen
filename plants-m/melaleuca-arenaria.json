    "intro": "Melaleuca arenaria, commonly known as the sandpaper mahogany, is a small evergreen shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its rough, sandpapery bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, often found in dune environments. Melaleuca arenaria is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize sand dunes."
