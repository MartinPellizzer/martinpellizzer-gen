It is a small shrub characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces pale yellow to white flowers that are typically arranged in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
