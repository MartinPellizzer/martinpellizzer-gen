    "intro": "Melanthera populifolia, commonly known as the poplar-leaved melanthera, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melanthiaceae. It is native to the eastern United States, where it typically grows in moist, woodland habitats. The plant is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that resemble those of poplar trees, hence its common name. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, often with a pale green or yellowish hue. Melanthera populifolia is often found in shaded areas and plays a role in supporting local pollinators and wildlife."
