    "intro": "Microula bhutanica, commonly known as the Bhutan star flower, is a small, perennial herb native to the Himalayan regions of Bhutan and India. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in rocky, high-altitude habitats and is adapted to the cold, arid conditions of its native environment. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Microula bhutanica is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
