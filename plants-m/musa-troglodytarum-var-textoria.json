    "intro": "Musa troglodytarum var. textoria, commonly known as the underground banana, is a rare and lesser-known variety of banana plant. It is characterized by its unique growth habit, where the plant develops an extensive underground stem system. The leaves are large, broad, and typically have a waxy surface, while the flowers are clustered in a short inflorescence. This variety is native to tropical regions and thrives in humid, well-drained soils. Due to its rarity and specific growing conditions, it is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
