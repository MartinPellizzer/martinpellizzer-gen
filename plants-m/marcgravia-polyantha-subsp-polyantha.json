    "intro": "Marcgravia polyantha subsp. polyantha, commonly known as the showy coca or the red coca, is a climbing epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America. It features striking, velvety purple bracts that surround its small, white flowers, which are typically visited by hummingbirds. The plant has a robust stem with adventitious roots that help it attach to tree trunks in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually ovate to elliptic, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in warm, humid environments."
