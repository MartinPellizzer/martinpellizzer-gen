    "intro": "Machaerium marginatum, commonly known as the coastal machaerium, is a perennial shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, trifoliate leaves with a distinctive white or pale margin. The plant produces small, pale yellow to greenish flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas, wetlands, and disturbed sites. Machaerium marginatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in marginal environments."
