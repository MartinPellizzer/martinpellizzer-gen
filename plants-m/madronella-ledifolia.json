It typically grows in coastal areas and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent properties. The plant is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a hardy coastal species."
