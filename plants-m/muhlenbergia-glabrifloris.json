    "intro": "Muhlenbergia glabrifloris, commonly known as the smoothflower muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, white to pale blue flowers. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Muhlenbergia glabrifloris is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
