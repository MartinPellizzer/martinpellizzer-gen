    "intro": "Microlicia sphagnicola, commonly known as the bog microlicia, is a rare and specialized liverwort species. It is primarily found in acidic, moist environments such as peat bogs and wetlands. This plant has a thalloid structure, meaning it lacks true stems and leaves, and instead has a flat, ribbon-like body. It is closely associated with sphagnum moss, often growing in dense mats within its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed wetland ecosystems."
