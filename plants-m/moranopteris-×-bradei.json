    "intro": "Moranopteris \u00d7 bradei, commonly known as the hybrid fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Moranopteris australis and M. spinulosa. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a slender, creeping rhizome. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Its foliage is often used in horticultural displays due to its ornamental appearance. However, due to its sterility, it does not produce viable seeds and relies on vegetative propagation for survival."
