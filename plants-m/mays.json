    "intro": "Mays, commonly known as maize, is a tall annual grass native to the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, blade-like leaves and its distinctive tassel-like inflorescence at the top of the plant. The ear of maize, which contains the edible kernels, develops at the base of the tassel. Maize is a C4 plant, meaning it efficiently performs photosynthesis in hot and dry conditions. It is a staple crop in many parts of the world and has been cultivated for thousands of years."
