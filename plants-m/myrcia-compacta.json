    "intro": "Myrcia compacta, commonly known as the Brazilian peppertree, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree that can grow up to 6 meters in height. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are opposite in arrangement and often have a slight aromatic scent. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its invasive growth in some regions."
