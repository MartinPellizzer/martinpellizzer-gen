    "intro": "Mikania scandens var. intermedia, commonly known as the spreading wisteria, is a vigorous climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often lobed, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white or pale purple, which bloom throughout the growing season. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for covering trellises or as a ground cover, though it can be invasive if not managed. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
