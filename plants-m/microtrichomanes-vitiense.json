    "intro": "Microtrichomanes vitiense, commonly known as the Vitiense Fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to the Pacific islands, particularly Vanuatu. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rock surfaces or in dense undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
