    "intro": "Microstylis cochleariifolia, commonly known as the spiral-leaf microstylis, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, spirally arranged leaves that give it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of small, clustered spikelets, and it produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
