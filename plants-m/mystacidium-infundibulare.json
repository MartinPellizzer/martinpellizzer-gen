    "intro": "Mystacidium infundibulare, commonly known as the funnel-shaped liverwort, is a thalloid liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its flat, ribbon-like thallus that often forms dense mats on moist, shaded rocky surfaces. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and instead has a simple, undifferentiated body structure. It produces small, stalked capsules for spore dispersal, which are typically clustered at the tips of the thallus. Mystacidium infundibulare is often found in temperate regions and thrives in humid, nutrient-rich environments."
