    "intro": "Margacola parvula, commonly known as the small margacola, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and pale yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant is typically found in shaded, moist environments, often growing in the understorey of dense vegetation. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, Margacola parvula is considered vulnerable and requires protection to ensure its survival."
