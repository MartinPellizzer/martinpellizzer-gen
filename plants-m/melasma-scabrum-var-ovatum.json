    "intro": "Melasma scabrum var. ovatum, commonly known as the rough skin lichen, is a variant of the species Melasma scabrum. It is characterized by its distinctive, rough, and scaly appearance, which is typical of the lichen family. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its botanical features include a dense, crust-like structure formed by the union of fungal hyphae and algae or cyanobacteria. This unique morphology allows it to survive in harsh conditions by reducing water loss and increasing resistance to environmental stress."
