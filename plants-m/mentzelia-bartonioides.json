    "intro": "Mentzelia bartonioides, commonly known as the desert blazingstar, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with a slender, branching stem that often grows in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces showy, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Mentzelia bartonioides is part of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is known for its ecological importance to pollinators in its native habitat."
