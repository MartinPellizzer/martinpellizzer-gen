It belongs to the family Commelinaceae, which includes plants known for their diverse growth forms and ecological adaptations. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped lobes, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the summer. Murdannia triquetra is often found in wet meadows and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its tolerance of disturbed soils."
