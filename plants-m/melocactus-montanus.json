    "intro": "Melocactus montanus, commonly known as the Mexican apple cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a distinctive red or orange spiny crown that resembles an apple. The plant has a short, thick stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange and appear at the top of the spines. Melocactus montanus is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
