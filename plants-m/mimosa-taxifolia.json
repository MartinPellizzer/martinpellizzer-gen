    "intro": "Mimosa taxifolia, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous species native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Mimosa taxifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions."
