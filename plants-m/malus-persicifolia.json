    "intro": "Malus persicifolia, commonly known as the Chinese apple or Siberian crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China and the Russian Far East. It features elliptical, dark green leaves that turn yellow in the fall, and it produces small, fragrant flowers in spring. The plant is noted for its ornamental value, with showy pink or white blossoms that attract pollinators. Its fruits are small, yellow or red apples that are edible but not typically cultivated for consumption. Malus persicifolia is often used in horticulture for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal in gardens."
