    "intro": "Macrozamia macleayi, commonly known as the Macleay's cycad, is a slow-growing, evergreen plant native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, and it is dioecious. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a sunny to partially shaded environment. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is protected in many areas."
