    "intro": "Mouriri ulei, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for some wildlife but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in ecological contexts."
