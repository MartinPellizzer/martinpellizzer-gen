It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade. This variety is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal."
