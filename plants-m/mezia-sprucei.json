    "intro": "Mezia sprucei, commonly known as the Spruce's meadowmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It typically thrives in moist, rocky or sandy soils, often found in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant features small, oval-shaped leaves that are densely packed along its stems, forming a mat-like structure. Its flowers are inconspicuous, consisting of tiny, greenish-yellow blooms that appear in early summer. Mezia sprucei plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small invertebrates."
