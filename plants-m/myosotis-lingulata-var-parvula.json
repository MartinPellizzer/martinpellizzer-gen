    "intro": "Myosotis lingulata var. parvula, commonly known as the dwarf forget-me-not, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate blue to purple flowers with five petals, typically appearing in clusters along the stems. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often smaller than those of the typical species. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a wildflower in naturalized settings."
