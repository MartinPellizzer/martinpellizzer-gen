    "intro": "Microlonchus salmanticus var. leptolonchus, commonly known as the slender root dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like stems and small, scale-like leaves, which are typically covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually yellow or green, and it relies on wind for pollination. It is native to southern Europe and is often found growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the growth and health of its host species."
