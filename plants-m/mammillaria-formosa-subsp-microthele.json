    "intro": "Mammillaria formosa subsp. microthele, commonly known as the miniature hedgehog cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to southern Mexico. It features a globular or cylindrical stem covered with white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Due to its delicate appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for indoor cactus enthusiasts."
