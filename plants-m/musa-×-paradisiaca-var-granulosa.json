    "intro": "Musa \u00d7 paradisiaca var. granulosa, commonly known as the granulated banana, is a cultivar of the banana plant characterized by its unique, rough, and bumpy skin. This variety is part of the Musaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia. The plant produces large, elongated fruits that are typically yellow when ripe, though they may retain a greenish hue depending on the variety. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance. The granulated texture of its peel distinguishes it from other banana varieties and makes it a popular choice for decorative purposes."
