    "intro": "Margaritopsis gossweileri, commonly known as the African snowflake, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form with small, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powder. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in spring, giving it a delicate, frost-like appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is also valued in horticultural collections."
