    "intro": "Maerua hirticaulis, commonly known as the woolly maerua, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It has a compact, bushy growth habit with dense, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The leaves are small, linear, and covered in fine, white hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This plant is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
