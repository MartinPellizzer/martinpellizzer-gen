    "intro": "Mikania scandens var. pilcomayensis, commonly known as the Andean morning glory, is a vigorous climbing vine native to the Andes region of South America. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves with a distinctive deep green color and a slightly pubescent surface. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, opening in the morning and closing by midday. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its rapid growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens but can become invasive if not managed properly."
