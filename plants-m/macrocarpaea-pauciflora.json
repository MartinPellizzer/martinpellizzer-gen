It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed beyond its native range."
