    "intro": "Mammillaria echinata var. densa, commonly known as the dense spined mammillaria, is a compact cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular stem covered in dense, white to pale yellow tubercles. The plant produces small, pink or red flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
