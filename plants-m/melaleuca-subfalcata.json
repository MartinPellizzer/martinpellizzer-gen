    "intro": "Melaleuca subfalcata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia, where it typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and its distinctive, papery bark that peels in thin layers. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Melaleuca subfalcata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
