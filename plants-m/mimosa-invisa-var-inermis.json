    "intro": "Mimosa invisa var. inermis, commonly known as the velvetleaf mimosa, is a perennial shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features compound leaves that are typically covered in a dense, velvety pubescence, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flower heads that are clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it an invasive species in many areas where it is not native."
