    "intro": "Mephitidia chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese yew, is a slow-growing evergreen tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, needle-like leaves and reddish-brown bark that exudes a strong, aromatic resin. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain birds and mammals. It is widely cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments. The Chinese yew is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
