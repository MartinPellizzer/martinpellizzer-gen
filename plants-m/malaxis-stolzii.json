    "intro": "Malaxis stolzii, commonly known as the Stolz's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, often hairy growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
