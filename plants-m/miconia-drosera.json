    "intro": "Miconia drosera, commonly known as the sticky miconia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that often have a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves contain a sticky substance that can trap small insects, contributing to its role in the ecosystem. However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native plants."
