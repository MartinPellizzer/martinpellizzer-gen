It is characterized by its ear-shaped, gelatinous cap that turns brown with age. The fungus typically grows on dead wood, particularly in temperate forests, and is often found in association with hardwood trees. Its unique appearance and texture make it a distinctive species within the fungal kingdom. Marcetia auricularia is valued in some culinary traditions for its mild flavor and chewy consistency."
