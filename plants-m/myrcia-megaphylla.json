It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Its flowers are small, clustered, and typically have a fragrant scent, attracting various pollinators. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds."
