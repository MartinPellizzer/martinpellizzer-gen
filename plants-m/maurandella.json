    "intro": "Maurandella, commonly known as the \"bluebell\" or \"blue bellflower,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Bignoniaceae. These plants are native to South America, particularly Brazil, and are characterized by their striking blue or violet flowers. The leaves are typically opposite, simple, and ovate, while the flowers are clustered in racemes or cymes. Maurandella species are often grown as ornamental plants due to their vibrant colors and unique floral structures. They prefer full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making them suitable for gardens and landscapes."
