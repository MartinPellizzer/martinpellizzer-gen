    "intro": "Microchilus repens, commonly known as the creeping microchilus, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically forms dense mats of small, succulent leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
