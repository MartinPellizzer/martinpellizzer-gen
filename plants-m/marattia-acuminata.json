    "intro": "Marattia acuminata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved staghorn fern, is a tropical evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, tree-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its long, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of spore-producing structures called sori. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Marattia acuminata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
