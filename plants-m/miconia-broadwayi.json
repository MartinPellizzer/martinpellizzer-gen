    "intro": "Miconia broadwayi, commonly known as the broadway miconia, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom throughout the year. Miconia broadwayi is often found in humid, lowland forests and thrives in shaded environments. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, where it can outcompete native vegetation."
