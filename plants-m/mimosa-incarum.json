    "intro": "Mimosa incarum, commonly known as the velvetleaf mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. Mimosa incarum is also known for its sensitive leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait that gives it its common name."
