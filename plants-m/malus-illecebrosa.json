    "intro": "Malus illecebrosa, commonly known as the deceptive apple, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the eastern Himalayas and is characterized by its attractive, showy flowers that can be misleading in appearance. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are often mistaken for true apples, hence its common name. It typically grows in moist, temperate climates and prefers well-drained soils. Malus illecebrosa is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
