    "intro": "Munnozia ortiziae, commonly known as the San Benito sage, is a flowering plant native to California and northern Baja California. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and produces showy, violet-blue flowers during the summer months. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. It is a member of the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Munnozia ortiziae is considered a rare and endangered species."
