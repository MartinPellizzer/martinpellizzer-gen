    "intro": "Mansonia altissima var. kamerunia, commonly known as the Cameroon mangrove, is a tropical tree species native to the coastal regions of West Africa. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage and robust, buttressed roots adapted to waterlogged soils. The plant thrives in brackish and freshwater environments, often forming dense mangrove forests. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. This variant is notable for its ecological importance in stabilizing shorelines and supporting diverse marine and terrestrial life."
