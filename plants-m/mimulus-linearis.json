    "intro": "Mimulus linearis, commonly known as the narrowleaf monkeyflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and bright yellow, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows in moist, sunny habitats like streambanks and meadows. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial, depending on the climate, and often forms dense colonies. Mimulus linearis plays an important ecological role in supporting local insect populations and enhancing biodiversity in its native range."
