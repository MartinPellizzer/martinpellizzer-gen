    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 verticillata var. cruciata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairless stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 cm in width. The plant produces small, pale blue to violet flowers arranged in whorls along the stem, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows, often forming dense colonies. Its aromatic leaves and flowers contain essential oils, making it a valuable plant in both traditional medicine and horticulture."
