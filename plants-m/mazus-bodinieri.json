    "intro": "Mazus bodinieri, commonly known as the Chinese wallflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to China. It features fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Mazus bodinieri is valued for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
