    "intro": "Medicago laciniata subsp. brevispina, commonly known as the narrow-leafed clover, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features trifoliate leaves with narrow, serrated lobes and produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is characterized by its short, spiny stipules, which give it its subspecies name *brevispina*. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, meadows, and along roadsides. This species is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and is used in forage and ecological restoration projects."
