It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and intricate, veined foliage that resembles marble, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
