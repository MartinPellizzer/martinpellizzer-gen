It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that turn a striking red or pink color when mature. The plant produces small, yellow, globular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often used in xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
