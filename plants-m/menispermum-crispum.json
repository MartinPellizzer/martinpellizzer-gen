    "intro": "Menispermum crispum, commonly known as Indian raspberry, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Menispermaceae and is characterized by its palmate leaves and fragrant, red-orange berries. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of its distinctive berries. Its roots contain alkaloids and have been used in traditional medicine, though it is toxic in large quantities. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
