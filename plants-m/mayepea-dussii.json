    "intro": "Mayepea dussii, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces showy blue to violet flowers during the summer months. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Mayepea dussii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate regions."
