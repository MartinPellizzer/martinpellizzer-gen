    "intro": "Microlepia chingii, commonly known as the Chinese chain fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori. Microlepia chingii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
