    "intro": "Muscari longissimum, commonly known as the long-stemmed grape hyacinth, is a bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Mediterranean. It produces dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale blue to deep violet. The plant typically grows to a height of 10 to 20 inches and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging from a central bulb. Muscari longissimum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant."
