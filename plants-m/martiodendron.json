    "intro": "Martiodendron, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Olacaceae. It consists of several species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. The plants are characterized by their small, often fragrant flowers and woody stems that can be aromatic. They typically grow as shrubs or small trees, with some species reaching heights of up to 10 meters. The wood of Martiodendron is highly valued for its durability and unique reddish color, though it is also known for its ecological importance in certain habitats."
