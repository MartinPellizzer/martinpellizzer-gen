    "intro": "Menonvillea minima, commonly known as the miniature menonvillea, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires partial to full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental appeal and compact size, it is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a container plant."
