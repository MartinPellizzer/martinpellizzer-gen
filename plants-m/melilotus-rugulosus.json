    "intro": "Melilotus rugulosus, commonly known as rough melilot, is an annual legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in loose spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are small and oblong, enclosed in pods that split open when mature. Rough melilot is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas."
