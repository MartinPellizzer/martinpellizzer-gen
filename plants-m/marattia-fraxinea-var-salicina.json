    "intro": "Marattia fraxinea var. salicina, commonly known as the silver fern, is a varietal form of the native New Zealand fern. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-white undersides on its fronds, which give it its common name. The plant is a member of the Marattiaceae family and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are large, with a fan-like shape, and can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is a symbol of New Zealand's natural heritage."
