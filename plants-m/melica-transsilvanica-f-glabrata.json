    "intro": "Melica transsilvanica f. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth meadowgrass, is a variant of the species Melica transsilvanica, characterized by its reduced leaf pubescence. It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is typically found in moist meadows and riverine habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces inflorescences of spikelets that are often clustered in panicle-like structures. It is native to Central and Eastern Europe and is adapted to temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered plant species."
