    "intro": "Masdevallia elephanticeps, commonly known as the elephant's head orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its large, velvety, elephant-like flowers that are often a deep purple or violet with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows as a sympodial orchid, with pseudobulbs and long, strap-like leaves. It thrives in cool, humid environments with high light exposure but requires careful watering to avoid root rot. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts and conservationists alike."
