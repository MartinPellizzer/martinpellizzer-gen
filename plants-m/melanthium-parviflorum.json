    "intro": "Melanthium parviflorum, commonly known as the smallflower false nettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. Its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature. Melanthium parviflorum is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its aesthetic appeal in natural landscapes."
