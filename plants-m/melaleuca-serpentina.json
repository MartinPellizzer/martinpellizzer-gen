    "intro": "Melaleuca serpentina, commonly known as the narrow-leaf paperbark, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a reddish or brownish inner layer. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically visited by nectar-feeding insects and birds. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered with a fine layer of wax. Melaleuca serpentina is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it is often found in heathlands and coastal scrub habitats."
