    "intro": "Malesherbia solanoides var. solanoides, commonly known as the silverleaf mallow, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It features hairy, silver-green leaves that give it its common name, and it produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
