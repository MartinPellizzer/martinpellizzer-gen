    "intro": "Myllanthus, commonly known as the sacred tree or the tree of life, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its large, spreading canopy and long, pendulous pods. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a valuable species for reforestation. Myllanthus species often have compound leaves and produce showy, yellow or orange flowers that attract pollinators. It is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
