    "intro": "Menodora heterophylla var. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable menodora, is a species of flowering plant in the family Menodoreae. It is native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant is characterized by its alternate, simple, and often hairy leaves, which vary in shape depending on the environmental conditions. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, and its fruit is a capsule that disperses seeds by wind. This plant is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought."
