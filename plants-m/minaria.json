    "intro": "Minaria, commonly known as the rock cress, is a genus of flowering plants in the mustard family, Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically range in color from white to pink. The plants are often found growing in rocky or sandy soils, particularly in arid or semi-arid regions. Minaria species are generally herbaceous, with narrow, grass-like leaves and a short, branching stem. They play a role in stabilizing soil in their native habitats and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
