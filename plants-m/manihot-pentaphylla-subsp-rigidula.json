    "intro": "Manihot pentaphylla subsp. rigidula, commonly known as the rigidleaf arrowleaf, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its broad, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically rigid and covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as riverbanks and forest edges. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in warm climates."
