    "intro": "Milium effusum subsp. confertum, commonly known as the hairy millet, is a flowering plant species native to parts of Asia and the Americas. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, grass-like leaves. The plant produces panicles of tiny, white to pale green flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
