It is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, characterized by its delicate, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant has pinnately divided leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in open fields. The species is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas, making it both a common weed and a subject of ecological study."
