    "intro": "Mendoncia bivalvis, commonly known as the two-valved mendoncia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant features a slender, upright stem with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in compound umbels, and bloom during the cooler months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
