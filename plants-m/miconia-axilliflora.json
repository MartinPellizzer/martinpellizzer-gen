    "intro": "Miconia axilliflora, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are typically borne in the leaf axils. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous tiny seeds. Miconia axilliflora is known for its rapid growth and is often considered an invasive species in certain regions."
