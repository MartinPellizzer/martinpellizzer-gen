    "intro": "Mimosa chochisensis, commonly known as the Choc\u00f3 mimosa, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and riverbanks. It has a shallow root system and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-rich soils. Mimosa chochisensis is also known for its sensitive leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait shared with other species in the Mimosa genus."
