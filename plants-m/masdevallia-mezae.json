    "intro": "Masdevallia mezae, commonly known as the Mezae masdevallia, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, often bi-colored flowers that range from red to purple. The plant typically produces a single, showy bloom on a short stem, which is a common trait among many masdevallia species. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. This orchid thrives in cool, humid environments and requires indirect light for optimal growth."
