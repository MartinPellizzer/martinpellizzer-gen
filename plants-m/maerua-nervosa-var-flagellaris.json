    "intro": "Maerua nervosa var. flagellaris, commonly known as the flagellate maerua, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Capparaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems that often appear whip-like, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Maerua nervosa var. flagellaris is often used in traditional medicine and has ecological importance as a source of forage for wildlife."
