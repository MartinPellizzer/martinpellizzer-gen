    "intro": "Mikania penstemonoides, commonly known as the Mexican morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant is a vigorous climber with opposite, heart-shaped leaves and can grow up to several meters in length. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Due to its rapid growth and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated but can become invasive if not managed properly."
