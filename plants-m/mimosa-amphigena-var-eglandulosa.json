    "intro": "Mimosa amphigena var. eglandulosa, commonly known as the glandular mimosa, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait known as thigmonasty. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its unique foliage and adaptive responses to touch make it an interesting subject in botanical studies."
