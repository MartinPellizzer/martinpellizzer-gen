    "intro": "Mammillaria beiselii, commonly known as the Beisel's hedgehog cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular shape with white to pale green stems covered in dense, white, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
