    "intro": "Mascagnia multiglandulosa var. surinamensis, commonly known as the Surinamese starfruit, is a species native to South America, particularly Suriname and Guyana. It is a shrub characterized by its woody stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces edible, star-shaped fruits that are similar in appearance to common starfruit but are less widely cultivated. Its leaves are typically ovate with a smooth surface and a slightly aromatic scent. The plant is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its potential culinary uses in local cuisines."
