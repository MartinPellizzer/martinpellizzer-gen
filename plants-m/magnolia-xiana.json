    "intro": "Magnolia xiana, commonly known as the Chinese magnolia, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves appear. The tree has broad, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall, adding to its seasonal appeal. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often developing fissures with age. The plant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and parks."
