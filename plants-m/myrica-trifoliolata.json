    "intro": "Myrica trifoliolata, commonly known as the three-leaved wax myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in whorls of three, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Myrica trifoliolata is also valued for its aromatic foliage and its ability to tolerate periodic flooding."
