    "intro": "Millettia australis, commonly known as the Australian legume or millettia, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a woody vine that belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Millettia australis is often found in dry, open habitats and is adapted to tolerate drought conditions. Its ecological importance includes providing food for native fauna and contributing to soil nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
