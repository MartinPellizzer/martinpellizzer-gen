It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and grasslands.
