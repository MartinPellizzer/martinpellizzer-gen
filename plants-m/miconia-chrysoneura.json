    "intro": "Miconia chrysoneura, commonly known as the goldenleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruits are fleshy berries that turn red when mature, containing numerous seeds. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative propagation, it is considered an invasive species in some regions."
