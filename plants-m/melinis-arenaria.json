    "intro": "Melinis arenaria, commonly known as sand bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, which helps it thrive in sandy and well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Sand bluestem is drought-tolerant and often found in disturbed soils, making it an important component of native grassland ecosystems. Its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion contributes to its ecological significance in sandy environments."
