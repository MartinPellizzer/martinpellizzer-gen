    "intro": "Mammillaria xanthina, commonly known as the yellow mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and yellowish-green stems covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on short, erect pedicels. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems and having a slow growth rate. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in rock gardens."
