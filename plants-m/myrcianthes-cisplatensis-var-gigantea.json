    "intro": "Myrcianthes cisplatensis var. gigantea, commonly known as the giant myrcianthes, is a strikingly large shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern Brazil. It is characterized by its robust, woody stems and broad, leathery leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, followed by small, round fruits that are typically red or orange when ripe. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, coastal environments. Due to its size and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens."
