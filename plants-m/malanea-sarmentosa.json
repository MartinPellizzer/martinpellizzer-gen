    "intro": "Malanea sarmentosa, commonly known as the creeping malanea, is a perennial shrub native to the Caribbean islands. It is characterized by its trailing stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of vegetation. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the dry season. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Malanea sarmentosa is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils."
