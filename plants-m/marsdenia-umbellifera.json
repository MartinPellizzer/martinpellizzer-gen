It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its milky sap, which is a common feature among plants in this group. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that are arranged in umbels, giving it its common name. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a hairy texture. Marsdenia umbellifera is typically found in forested areas and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and blooms."
