    "intro": "Microuratea pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf pandanus, is a small, shrub-like plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the family Pandanaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, sword-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in coastal and sandy soils, often in sheltered areas near the shoreline. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in terminal inflorescences, and it produces fruit that is used in traditional practices by local communities. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
