    "intro": "Miconia melanotricha, commonly known as the black-haired miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its broad, glossy leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces distinctive, berry-like fruits that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its ornamental value has made it a popular horticultural plant, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
