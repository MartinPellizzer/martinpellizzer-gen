    "intro": "Medicago, commonly known as the genus that includes species like Medicago sativa, is a group of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are characterized by their trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets, and their pea-like flowers that typically range in color from white to pink. Medicago species are known for their ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in their root nodules. They are often found in a variety of habitats, including grasslands, disturbed soils, and agricultural fields. Many species within this genus are cultivated for forage and are also used in ecological restoration projects due to their hardy nature and nitrogen-fixing capabilities."
