    "intro": "Malcolmia torulosa var. contortuplicata, commonly known as the spiral-flowered mallows, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking spiral arrangement of leaves and its clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to arid environments. Its unique leaf morphology, with leaves curling in a helical pattern, is a key botanical feature. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes other flowering plants such as hibiscus and cotton."
