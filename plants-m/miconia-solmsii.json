    "intro": "Miconia solmsii, commonly known as the Solms's miconia, is a tropical shrub native to South America. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, broad leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats within the rainforest understory. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous small seeds. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
