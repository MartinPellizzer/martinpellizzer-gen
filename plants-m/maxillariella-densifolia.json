It is a small, epiphytic orchid that thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features dense, dark green foliage with a velvety texture, and its flowers are typically small, fragrant, and come in shades of white and pale pink. It prefers well-draining soil and consistent moisture, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation.
