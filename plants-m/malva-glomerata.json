    "intro": "Malva glomerata, commonly known as the woolly mallow, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fuzzy, hairy stems and leaves, which are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its showy inflorescences consist of numerous small, five-petaled flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters. Malva glomerata is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
