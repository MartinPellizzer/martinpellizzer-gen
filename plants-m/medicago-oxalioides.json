    "intro": "Medicago oxalioides, commonly known as the lesser medick, is a low-growing perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters. The plant has a deep root system that helps it thrive in poor soils and drought conditions. It is often found in grasslands, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas. Medicago oxalioides is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil restoration efforts."
