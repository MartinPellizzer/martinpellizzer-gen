    "intro": "Miconia rigidiuscula var. purpurascens, commonly known as the purple-leaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green on the upper surface and purplish on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions, though it can become invasive in some areas."
