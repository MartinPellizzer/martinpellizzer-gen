    "intro": "Montia fontana subsp. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate watercress, is a low-growing annual herb native to the western United States. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as streambanks and woodland floors. The plant features small, alternate leaves that are often submerged or floating, with slender, branched stems. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters, and it produces tiny, capsule-like fruits. This subspecies is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to other watercress species."
