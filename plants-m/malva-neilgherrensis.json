    "intro": "Malva neilgherrensis, commonly known as the Nilgiri mallow, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Western Ghats in India. It is characterized by its large, velvety leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or near streams. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is noted for its ornamental value. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
