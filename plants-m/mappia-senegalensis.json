    "intro": "Mappia senegalensis, commonly known as the Senegalese mallow, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its rough, ridged bark and large, palmate leaves. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal in the wild. Mappia senegalensis is often found in dry savannas and woodland areas, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
