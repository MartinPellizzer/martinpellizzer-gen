    "intro": "Mosiera elliptica subsp. camarioca, commonly known as the Camarioca ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
