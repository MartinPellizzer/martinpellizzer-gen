    "intro": "Malaxis greenwoodiana, commonly known as the Greenwood's Malaxis, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
