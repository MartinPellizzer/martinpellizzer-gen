    "intro": "Machilus grandifolius, commonly known as the large-leaf machilus, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often glossy and have a distinct aromatic scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by elliptical, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Machilus grandifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
