    "intro": "Medicago huberi, commonly known as the Turkish clover, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has a deep root system that helps it thrive in arid and rocky soils. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Medicago huberi is also valued for its role in forage and as a cover crop in agricultural systems."
