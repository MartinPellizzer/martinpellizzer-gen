    "intro": "Modiolastrum sandemanii, commonly known as the sandemanii sandwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or semi-arid regions."
