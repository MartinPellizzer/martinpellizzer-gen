    "intro": "Miconia glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melastomataceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. It produces berries that are typically red when mature, containing several seeds. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
