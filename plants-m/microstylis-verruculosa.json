    "intro": "Microstylis verruculosa, commonly known as the rough-stemmed microstylis, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly known as the sedge family, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in association with other wetland flora."
