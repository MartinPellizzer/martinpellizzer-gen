    "intro": "Monophyllorchis microstyloides, commonly known as the narrow-styled orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it thrives in humid and cool conditions. The plant features a single, slender stem with a few leaves and produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a short, narrow column. Its roots are adapted for absorbing nutrients from the forest floor, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
