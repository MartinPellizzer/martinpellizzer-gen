    "intro": "Melica aurantiaca, commonly known as the orange false brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with a reddish or orange hue, especially along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale green to yellowish flowers, which are typically arranged in two rows. Melica aurantiaca thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and woodland edges. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, where it adds a delicate, soft texture to landscapes."
