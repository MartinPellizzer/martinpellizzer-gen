    "intro": "Mentha aquatica var. limnetes, commonly known as water mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams, thriving in wet, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has slender, aromatic stems that are often square in cross-section, a characteristic feature of the mint family. Its small, opposite leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture. The flowers are tiny, clustered in whorls, and produce a mild, minty fragrance, attracting various pollinators."
