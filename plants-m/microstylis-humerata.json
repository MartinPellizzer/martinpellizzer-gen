    "intro": "Microstylis humerata, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a small, herbaceous plant native to certain regions of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in poorly drained soils. Its slender stems are usually less than 10 cm tall, and it produces small, three-angled spikelets that are often green or brown in color. Microstylis humerata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
