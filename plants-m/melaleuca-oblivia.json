    "intro": "Melaleuca oblivia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a pale, papery inner layer. The plant produces small, fragrant white or yellowish flowers clustered in spikes, which are typically borne in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly waxy texture, and they remain green throughout the year. Melaleuca oblivia is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in coastal and semi-arid regions."
