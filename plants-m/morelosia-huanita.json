    "intro": "Morelosia huanita, commonly known as the Huanita fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the cloud forests of southern Mexico. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are often adorned with small, spore-producing structures called sori. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an important subject for botanical study and conservation efforts. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal in horticultural settings."
