It is characterized by its spherical shape and is covered in white, woolly spines that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in rock gardens."
