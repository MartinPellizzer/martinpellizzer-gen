    "intro": "Microseris parvula, commonly known as the smallleaf scorchedgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and leafy basal rosettes. The plant typically features narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Microseris parvula is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, often found in dry meadows and open woodlands."
