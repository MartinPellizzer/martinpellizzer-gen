    "intro": "Miconia schomburgkii, commonly known as the Schomburgk's miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for various wildlife. It is often found in humid, lowland forests and is known for its rapid growth rate. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
