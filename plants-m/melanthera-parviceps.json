    "intro": "Melanthera parviceps, commonly known as the small-headed blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its small, blue to purple flowers bloom in late summer, and the plant has hairy, narrow leaves that are often mistaken for grasses. Melanthera parviceps is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
