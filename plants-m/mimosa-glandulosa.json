    "intro": "Mimosa glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular mimosa, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves that are sensitive to touch, folding shut when disturbed, a trait known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it often grows in rocky or sandy soils. Mimosa glandulosa is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant once established."
