It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela. The plant is characterized by its large, ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It produces clusters of small, showy flowers that are typically pink or white in color. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous tiny seeds, facilitating its spread in the wild."
