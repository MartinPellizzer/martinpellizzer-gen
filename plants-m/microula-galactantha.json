    "intro": "Microula galactantha, commonly known as the white microula, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. The plant has succulent leaves and stems, which help it retain water in its harsh environment. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in rocky areas. Due to its unique adaptations, it is of interest to botanists studying xerophytic plants."
