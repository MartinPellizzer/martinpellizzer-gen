    "intro": "Mimosa quadrangularis, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its quadrangular, hairy stems and bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in dense, globular clusters, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Its rapid leaf movement has made it a subject of scientific study in the field of plant physiology."
