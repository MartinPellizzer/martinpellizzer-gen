It features striking yellow flowers with a distinctive purple center, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained, moist soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and endangered species in its native range."
