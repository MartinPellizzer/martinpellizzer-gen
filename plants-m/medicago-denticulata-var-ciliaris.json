    "intro": "Medicago denticulata var. ciliaris, commonly known as the curled medic, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a robust root system that helps it thrive in poor soils and dry conditions. It is often found in grasslands, wastelands, and along roadsides. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment and as a forage plant."
