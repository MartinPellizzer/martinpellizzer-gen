    "intro": "Microsorum tenuilore, commonly known as the narrow-veined water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates while absorbing nutrients from the water. The plant's small, spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in aquatic habitats."
