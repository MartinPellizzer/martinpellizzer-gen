    "intro": "Muhlenbergia iridifolia, commonly known as the blue muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that produce clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage that adds a striking visual contrast to gardens. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils. Muhlenbergia iridifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
