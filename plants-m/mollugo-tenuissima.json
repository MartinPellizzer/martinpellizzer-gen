    "intro": "Mollugo tenuissima, commonly known as slender sandpurs, is a low-growing annual plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features tiny, hairless leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily, it is considered a weed in some regions."
