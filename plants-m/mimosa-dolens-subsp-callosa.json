It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its subspecies status highlights its distinct morphological features, including the presence of hairy stipules along the leaf stems."
