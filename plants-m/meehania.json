    "intro": "Meehania, commonly known as the mountain tea, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are native to southern and eastern Africa, with some species found in Australia and the Pacific Islands. Meehania species are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their simple, opposite leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. They often grow in rocky or coastal areas, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
