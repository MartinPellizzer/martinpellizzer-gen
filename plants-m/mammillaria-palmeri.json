    "intro": "Mammillaria palmeri, commonly known as the Palmer's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a dense covering of spines and is often mistaken for other Mammillaria species due to its similar appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, ribbed fruits. Mammillaria palmeri is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts."
