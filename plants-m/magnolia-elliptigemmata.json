    "intro": "Magnolia elliptigemmata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved magnolia, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves and large, showy white flowers that bloom in early spring. The flowers emit a subtle fragrance and are composed of numerous petal-like structures called tepals. This species is known for its slow growth and preference for well-drained, acidic soils in shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but endangered plant in its native range."
