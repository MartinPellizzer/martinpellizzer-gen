    "intro": "Meyna grisea, commonly known as the grey meyna, is a small passerine bird native to Australia and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive grey plumage, with a slightly darker head and underparts. The bird has a slender body, a short beak, and relatively long wings, which aid in its agile flight patterns. Meyna grisea typically inhabits open woodlands, grasslands, and agricultural areas, where it forages for insects and small invertebrates. Its call is a sharp, staccato series of notes, often used for communication within its social group."
