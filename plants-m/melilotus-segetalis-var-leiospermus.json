    "intro": "Melilotus segetalis var. leiospermus, commonly known as yellow sweet clover, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, erect stems with opposite, pinnately compound leaves that are green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and often form a dense mat, contributing to soil stabilization. This variety is valued for its forage qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
