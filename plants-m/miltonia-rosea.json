    "intro": "Miltonia rosea, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper orchid, is a tropical orchid native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its showy, pinkish-white petals and a distinctive, pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers bloom in spring and summer, often in clusters, and it produces small, greenish-yellow fruits that contain seeds. Miltonia rosea is valued for its ornamental beauty and is cultivated for horticultural purposes."
