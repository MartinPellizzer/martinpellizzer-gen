    "intro": "Melaleuca hislopii, commonly known as the coastal melaleuca, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, often greyish bark and its small, aromatic leaves that are typically narrow and linear. The plant produces bottlebrush-like flowers in clusters, which are usually pink or red, and it is known for its ability to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. Melaleuca hislopii is also noted for its resilience to salt spray and its role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
