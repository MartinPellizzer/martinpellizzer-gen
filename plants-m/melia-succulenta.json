    "intro": "Melia succulenta, commonly known as the desert melia, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by orange or red berries. Its roots are deep and extensive, enabling it to access moisture from deep underground. Melia succulenta is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
