    "intro": "Mesosphaerum lorentzianum, commonly known as the Lorentzian mesosphaerum, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in its natural habitat. Its leaves are large,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and often have a waxy surface to reduce water loss in humid environments. The flowers, which bloom in clusters, are predominantly pink or red and attract pollinators such as bees and birds."
