    "intro": "Microcos latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf microcos, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits known as capsules. Its leaves are often hairy and have a rough texture, while its flowers are arranged in terminal or axillary clusters. Microcos latifolia is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
