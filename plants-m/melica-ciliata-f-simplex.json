    "intro": "Melica ciliata f. simplex, commonly known as the simple-fringed wheatgrass, is a grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial plant characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are typically green to pale blue in color. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. This plant is often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky areas."
