    "intro": "Mandevilla subcordata, commonly known as the wax plant, is a tropical vine native to South America. It is characterized by its glossy, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a slight red or purple tinge on the underside. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in warm, humid conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Mandevilla subcordata is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its vibrant flowers and ornamental foliage."
