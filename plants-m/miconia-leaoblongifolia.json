    "intro": "Miconia leaoblongifolia, commonly known as the long-leaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, elongated, and often heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by dark red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain regions."
