    "intro": "Mahonia feddei, commonly known as the coastal mahonia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with dark green, leathery leaves that have a distinctive spiny margin. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, followed by blue-black berries that are a food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it adaptable to coastal environments. Mahonia feddei is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate salt spray and drought conditions."
