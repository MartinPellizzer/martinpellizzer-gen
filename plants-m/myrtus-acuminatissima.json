    "intro": "Myrtus acuminatissima, commonly known as the narrow-leaved myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, compact form. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by dark purple berries. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has a historical use in traditional medicine. Myrtus acuminatissima is well-suited to coastal areas due to its tolerance of salty air and well-drained soils."
