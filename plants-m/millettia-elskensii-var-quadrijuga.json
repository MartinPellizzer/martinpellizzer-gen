    "intro": "Millettia elskensii var. quadrijuga, commonly known as the four-winged millettia, is a deciduous climbing plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive four-winged fruits. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its twining stems allow it to climb and spread across trees and shrubs in its natural habitat. The seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
