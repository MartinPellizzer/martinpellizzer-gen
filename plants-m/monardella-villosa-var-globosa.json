It is characterized by its globular, clustered flower heads that bloom in late summer to early fall. The plant features hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, which help it retain moisture in dry conditions. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and meadows. Its nectar-rich flowers attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
