    "intro": "Monanthos lamproglossus, commonly known as the long-tongued violet, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers with long, narrow petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. The long, slender lower petal, known as the spur, is adapted to attract specific pollinators like bees and butterflies."
