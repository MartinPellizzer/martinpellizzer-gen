    "intro": "Mitrophyllum roseum, commonly known as the roseum mitrophyllum, is a rare and striking plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant pink to red flowers, which bloom in clusters during the summer months. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. Its botanical structure includes a slender, branching stem with a fibrous root system adapted to its moist, shaded habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
