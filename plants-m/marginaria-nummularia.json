    "intro": "Marginaria nummularia, commonly known as the pennywort, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant features small, round, succulent leaves that are often a vibrant green, and it produces tiny white flowers in the summer. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported healing properties. The plant's compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a low-maintenance, decorative plant."
