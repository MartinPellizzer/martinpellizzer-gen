    "intro": "Mangifera parish, commonly known as the dwarf mango, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers and edible, sweet fruits. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, yellow-orange fruits that are typically smaller than those of the common mango. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit production. The tree is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it suitable for various tropical and subtropical regions."
