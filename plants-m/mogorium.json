    "intro": "Mogorium, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Mogorium is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its use in traditional medicine."
