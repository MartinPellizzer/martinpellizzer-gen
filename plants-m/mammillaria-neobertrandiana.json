It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in white to pale green tubercles. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. It produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Due to its small size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
