    "intro": "Mapania hidiriana, commonly known as the hidden mapania, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique leaf structure, featuring broad, lance-shaped leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its growth habit is low shrub-like, with a tendency to form dense clusters in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
