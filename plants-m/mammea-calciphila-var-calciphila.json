    "intro": "Mammea calciphila var. calciphila, commonly known as the limestone mammea, is a rare shrub endemic to limestone soils in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and elliptical, leathery leaves with a smooth surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by orange or red berries. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is adapted to dry, tropical climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
