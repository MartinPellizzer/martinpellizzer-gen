    "intro": "Mammillaria dioica, commonly known as the two-colored prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in dense, white spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil. Mammillaria dioica is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a desert garden."
