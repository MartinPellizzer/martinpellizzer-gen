    "intro": "Meringium dimidiatum, commonly known as the half-moon lichen, is a unique foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive botanical structure. It consists of a dense, leathery thallus with a pale to yellowish-green coloration, often forming irregular, lobed patches. The plant's morphology includes a central layer of fungal hyphae intertwined with algal cells, which contribute to its photosynthetic capabilities. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on bark or stone in temperate regions. Its slow growth and specialized habitat make it a rare and ecologically significant species in forest ecosystems."
