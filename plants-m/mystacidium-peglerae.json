    "intro": "Mystacidium peglerae, commonly known as the New Zealand mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and typically grows on the branches of native trees such as kahikatea and rimu. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or pale yellow flowers that are followed by small, fleshy berries. It plays an important ecological role by providing food for birds and insects, while also drawing nutrients from its host tree. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
