    "intro": "Machaerium lindenianum, commonly known as the yellow machaerium, is a tropical perennial legume native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in compact, spherical clusters. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Machaerium lindenianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
