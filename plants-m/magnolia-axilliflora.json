    "intro": "Magnolia axilliflora, commonly known as the mountain magnolia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. Its flowers are borne in clusters at the base of the leaves, and the fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. Magnolia axilliflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its spring blossoms."
