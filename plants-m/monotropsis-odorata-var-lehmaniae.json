    "intro": "Monotropsis odorata var. lehmaniae, commonly known as the Lehman's Indian pipe, is a rare and unusual plant belonging to the family Onagraceae. It is a mycoheterotrophic species, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungi for its nutrients. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that are typically clustered at the base of its stem. It is native to the eastern United States, particularly in moist, shaded forest environments. Due to its specialized ecological requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for undisturbed habitats."
