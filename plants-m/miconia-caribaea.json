    "intro": "Miconia caribaea, commonly known as the Caribbean miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean region. It is characterized by its large, broad, and often palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia caribaea is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some areas. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially problematic in non-native habitats."
