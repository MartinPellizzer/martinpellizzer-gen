    "intro": "Muhlenbergia uniflora, commonly known as the plains muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the central and southern United States. It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, fluffy flowers, which are often wind-pollinated. Its slender, grass-like leaves are usually blue-green in color, and the plant is known for its drought tolerance and adaptability to various soil types. Muhlenbergia uniflora is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
