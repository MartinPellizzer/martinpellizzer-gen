    "intro": "Myagrum paniculatum, commonly known as the paperbark tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its thick, fibrous bark that peels away in strips, giving it its common name. The tree has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. It produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. The plant is often used in traditional Aboriginal medicine and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance in its native habitat."
