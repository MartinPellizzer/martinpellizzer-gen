    "intro": "Melocactus conoideus subsp. braunii, commonly known as the Braun's cone-shaped cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, conical shape and a short, thick stem that stores water. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, which are often followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its thick, waxy cuticle helps it conserve moisture in harsh desert environments. This subspecies is well adapted to extreme temperatures and low rainfall, making it a hardy choice for xerophytic gardens."
