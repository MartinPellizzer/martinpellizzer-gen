    "intro": "Microchilus goaltalensis, commonly known as the Goaltal mountain orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Goaltal Mountains. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers with a unique coloration pattern. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in shaded forest clearings. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
