    "intro": "Malaxis vitiensis, commonly known as the Vitiensis Malaxis, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil efficiently. Malaxis vitiensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
