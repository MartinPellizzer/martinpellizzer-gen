    "intro": "Muscari racemosum var. neglectum, commonly known as the common grape hyacinth, is a bulbous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It produces dense clusters of small, fragrant, violet-blue flowers that resemble tiny grapes, hence its common name. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained soil in full sun to partial shade. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to naturalize easily. This variety is more robust and less finicky than other grape hyacinth cultivars, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
