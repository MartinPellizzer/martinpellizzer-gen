    "intro": "Miconia anceps, commonly known as the Brazilian starwood, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by round, fleshy fruits. Miconia anceps is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive spread."
