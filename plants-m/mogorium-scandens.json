    "intro": "Mogorium scandens, commonly known as the climbing cypress, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cupressaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, particularly India and Sri Lanka. The plant is characterized by its slender, woody stems that climb using aerial roots, and its small, scale-like leaves arranged in opposite pairs. Its cones are typically borne in clusters and contain seeds that are dispersed by wind. Mogorium scandens is often used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
