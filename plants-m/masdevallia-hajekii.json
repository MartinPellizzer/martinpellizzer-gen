    "intro": "Masdevallia hajekii, commonly known as the Hajek's masdevallia, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its intricate, often pendulous flowers that display a mix of vibrant colors, including shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, exhibiting an epiphytic growth habit, and thrives in cool, humid environments with dappled sunlight. Its foliage consists of narrow, strap-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its unique aesthetic. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Masdevallia hajekii is considered a rare and endangered species."
