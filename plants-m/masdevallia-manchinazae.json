It is characterized by its intricate, often colorful inflorescence and unique floral structure, which includes a spurred labellum. The plant typically grows as a miniature orchid, with compact growth habit and small, delicate leaves. It thrives in high humidity and cool temperatures, making it a challenging species for cultivation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and orchid enthusiasts."
