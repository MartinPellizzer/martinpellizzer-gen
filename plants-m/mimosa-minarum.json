    "intro": "Mimosa minarum, commonly known as the silver mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and it has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. Its leaves are sensitive to touch, folding inward when disturbed, a trait known as thigmonastic response. Mimosa minarum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adaptable to a variety of soil types."
