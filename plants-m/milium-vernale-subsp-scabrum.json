It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and small, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, rough hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows and along roadsides. This subspecies is notable for its hardy nature and historical use in traditional agriculture."
