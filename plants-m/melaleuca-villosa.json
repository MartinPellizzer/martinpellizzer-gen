    "intro": "Melaleuca villosa, commonly known as the silky tea tree, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its greyish, flaky bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers clustered in spikes, which bloom from late spring to autumn. Its leaves and flowers are used in traditional Aboriginal medicine, and it is also cultivated for its ornamental value. Melaleuca villosa is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy areas."
