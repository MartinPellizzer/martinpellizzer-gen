    "intro": "Mollia lepidota subsp. lepidota, commonly known as the silverleaf mallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features lobed, hairy leaves that are often silver or gray in color due to the dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
