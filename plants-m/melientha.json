    "intro": "Melientha, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its small, white flowers and thick, waxy leaves that help it retain water in saline environments. The plant has a distinctive prop root system that allows it to stabilize itself in muddy or tidal soils. Melientha is often found in brackish water areas and plays a role in coastal ecosystem stabilization. Its seeds are dispersed by water, contributing to its distribution along shorelines."
