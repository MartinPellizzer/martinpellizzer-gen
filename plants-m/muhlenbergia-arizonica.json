    "intro": "Muhlenbergia arizonica, commonly known as Arizona muhlenbergia, is a species of grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. Its foliage is typically bluish-green, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are resistant to drought and heat. Arizona muhlenbergia is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
