    "intro": "Microuratea, commonly known as the small-leafed sea hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its small, often palmate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or red in color. These plants are typically found in coastal or brackish environments, thriving in sandy or muddy soils. They play an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species. Microuratea species are also valued for their ornamental qualities and are sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens."
