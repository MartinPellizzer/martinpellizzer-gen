    "intro": "Mentzelia tenerrima, commonly known as the desert evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and showy yellow or orange flowers that open in the evening. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually linear and arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Mentzelia tenerrima is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a short-lived perennial."
