    "intro": "Micrechites gracilis, commonly known as the slender greenbottle bush, is a small shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal umbels, followed by small, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its habitat preferences, it plays a role in supporting local insect and bird populations."
