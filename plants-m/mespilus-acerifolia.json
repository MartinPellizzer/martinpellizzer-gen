    "intro": "Mespilus acerifolia, commonly known as the maple-leaf medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its alternate, palmately lobed leaves that resemble those of maple trees, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by distinctive, fleshy fruits that ripen in the fall. The fruit has a unique, sweet-smelling pulp enclosed in a tough, woody shell. It is often grown for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
