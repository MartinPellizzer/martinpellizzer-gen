    "intro": "Monnina herzogii, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, exhibiting a low, spreading growth habit. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Monnina herzogii is adapted to thrive in harsh, dry environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
