    "intro": "Medicago orbicularis, commonly known as the roundleaf medick, is a low-growing perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, orbicular (rounded) leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, which are followed by small, hairy pods containing several seeds. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils, and is often found in disturbed or marginal areas. Medicago orbicularis is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a useful plant in ecological restoration and agricultural contexts."
