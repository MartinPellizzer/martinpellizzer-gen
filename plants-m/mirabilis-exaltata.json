    "intro": "Mirabilis exaltata, commonly known as the \"Flame Flower,\" is a strikingly beautiful plant native to South America. It is a perennial herb that produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant is characterized by its erect, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers bloom in the evening and remain open through the night, a trait known as nyctinasty. This unique flowering behavior makes it a popular choice for gardens and botanical collections."
