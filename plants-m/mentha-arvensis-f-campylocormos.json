It is characterized by its densely hairy stems and leaves, which provide a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. It produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorled clusters, typical of the Lamiaceae family. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, making it a valuable plant for both ecological and potential medicinal uses."
