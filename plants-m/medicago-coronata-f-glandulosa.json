    "intro": "Medicago coronata f. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular crown vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with glandular structures on the leaflets, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees. It is a perennial shrub that thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or semi-natural habitats. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
