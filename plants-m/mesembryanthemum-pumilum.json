    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features fleshy, ribbed leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow, and white, typically blooming in spring. It is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal make it a valued addition to rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
