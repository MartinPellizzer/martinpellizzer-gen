    "intro": "Mucuna pruriens var. thekkadiensis, commonly known as the Kerala velvet bean, is a climbing legume native to the tropical regions of India. It is characterized by its hairy, serpentine stems and trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine, irritating hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elongated pods containing flat, dark seeds. It is valued for its high protein content and traditional use in Ayurvedic medicine. Due to its allergenic properties, it requires careful handling during cultivation and processing."
