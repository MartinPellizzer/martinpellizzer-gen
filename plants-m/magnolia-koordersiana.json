    "intro": "Magnolia koordersiana, commonly known as the Koord's magnolia, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southern China and northern Vietnam. It is characterized by its large, showy, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The leaves are broad, ovate, and have a smooth, dark green surface with a slightly hairy underside. The plant thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in forested areas at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after species in horticulture, though it is relatively rare in cultivation."
