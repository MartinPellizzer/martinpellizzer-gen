    "intro": "Marcetia hatschbachii, commonly known as the Hatschbach's marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized plant found in specific wetland habitats. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, waterlogged soils, often in marshy or swampy areas. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Marcetia hatschbachii is considered endangered in many regions."
