    "intro": "Mariscus riparius var. gillii, commonly known as the Gill's marshmallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of North America. It features succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to thrive in moist, often waterlogged environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, arranged in clusters at the base of the stems. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize the soil in its wetland habitat. This variant is distinguished by its slightly larger leaves and more robust growth compared to the typical Mariscus riparius."
