    "intro": "Menophyla lunaria, commonly known as the moonlight fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices, where it can absorb the necessary nutrients from decaying organic matter. The plant's fronds are characterized by their finely divided, silvery-green leaves that shimmer in the light, giving it its common name. Its reproductive structure consists of small, spore-bearing capsules that release microscopic spores into the air. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Menophyla lunaria is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
