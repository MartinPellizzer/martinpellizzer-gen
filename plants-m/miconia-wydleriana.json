    "intro": "Miconia wydleriana, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces showy, clustered inflorescences with bright red bracts that are highly visible and attract pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
