    "intro": "Mentha longifolia var. polyadena, commonly known as sweet catnip, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers arranged in whorled clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, giving it a distinct minty scent and making it useful in herbal teas and as a natural insect repellent. This variety is closely related to other members of the mint family and is often cultivated for its ornamental and medicinal properties."
