It features slender, branching stems with small, bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow, spherical flower heads that open in response to touch, a characteristic known as thigmonastic movement. Its flowers are followed by flat, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. This species is adapted to dry, open habitats and is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils."
