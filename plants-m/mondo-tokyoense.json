    "intro": "Mondo tokyoense, commonly known as Japanese forest grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to East Asia. It features narrow, dark green leaves that form a dense, mat-like growth pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in late spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often used in ornamental landscaping. Its ability to tolerate shade and compact growth make it a popular choice for ground cover in woodland gardens."
