    "intro": "Malus pumila f. translucens, commonly known as the translucent apple, is a botanical variant of the apple tree characterized by its unique leaf and fruit characteristics. The leaves are typically thinner and more translucent compared to standard apple varieties, allowing light to pass through them. The fruit is usually smaller and has a distinct, often more delicate skin texture. It is primarily cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal rather than for fruit production. This cultivar is valued in botanical gardens and private collections for its visual interest and genetic significance."
