    "intro": "Mazus fruticosus, commonly known as creeping mazus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and western Asia. It features prostrate or ascending stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly across the ground. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a hairy texture that helps it retain moisture. Mazus fruticosus thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
