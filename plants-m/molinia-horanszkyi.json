    "intro": "Molinia horanszkyi, commonly known as the Hungarian moor grass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Europe. It typically grows in wet meadows, bogs, and other moist habitats, preferring acidic soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tufted at the base, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It plays an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of its native wetland environments. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
