    "intro": "Medicago tornata subsp. helix, commonly known as the helix medick, is a perennial legume native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense mats. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture and produces small, yellow flowers in racemes. Its root system is well-developed, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. It is also valued for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, benefiting surrounding vegetation."
