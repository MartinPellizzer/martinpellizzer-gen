    "intro": "Mammillaria sulphurea, commonly known as the sulphur mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its globular shape and dense covering of white to yellowish spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its spiny exterior. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water. Mammillaria sulphurea is a popular choice for rock gardens and succulent collections due to its compact size and ornamental appeal."
