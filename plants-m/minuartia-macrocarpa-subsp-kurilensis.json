    "intro": "Minuartia macrocarpa subsp. kurilensis, commonly known as the Kuril sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Russian Far East and the Kuril Islands. It thrives in rocky, coastal environments and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh, maritime climates and is often found in sand dunes or on cliffs. It has a compact growth habit and is well-suited to nutrient-poor soils. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
