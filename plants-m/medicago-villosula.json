    "intro": "Medicago villosula, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Medicago villosula is often used in agriculture as a cover crop and forage plant."
