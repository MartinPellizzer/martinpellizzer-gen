    "intro": "Maxillaria parva, commonly known as the miniature orchid or dwarf orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to Central and South America. It typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories or rocky crevices. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom during the warmer months. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil. Maxillaria parva is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its compact size and ornamental value."
