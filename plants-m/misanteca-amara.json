    "intro": "Misanteca amara, commonly known as the bitter nightshade, is a perennial plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and peppers. The plant is characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the evening. Its berries, which are toxic, are often mistaken for edible fruits due to their appearance. The plant's name reflects both its bitterness and its association with the night, as it thrives in shady, moist environments."
