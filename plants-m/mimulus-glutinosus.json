    "intro": "Mimulus glutinosus, commonly known as the sticky monkeyflower, is a flowering plant native to western North America. It is characterized by its bright orange or yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces sticky, glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which give it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Mimulus glutinosus is a perennial herb that is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for pollinators."
