    "intro": "Menomphalus cineraria, commonly known as the ash-gray orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale green to brownish flowers that bloom in late spring. Its flowers are often overlooked due to their muted color, but they play a role in attracting specific pollinators. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
