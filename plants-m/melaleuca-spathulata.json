    "intro": "Melaleuca spathulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled pattern of white and grey underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pink, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a greyish-green hue. Melaleuca spathulata is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
