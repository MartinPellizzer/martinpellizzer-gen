    "intro": "Magostan, commonly known as the tropical fruit tree, is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in warm, humid climates. It produces a large, round fruit with a thick, leathery rind that contains a sweet, aromatic pulp. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its roots are deep and fibrous, allowing it to absorb nutrients efficiently from the soil. The fruit is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its high vitamin C content."
