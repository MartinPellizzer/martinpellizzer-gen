    "intro": "Maianthemum racemosum var. amplexicaule, commonly known as the clasping false lily of the valley, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial with a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often clasping around the stem. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in a raceme, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
