    "intro": "Masdevallia spectrum, commonly known as the rainbow orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its striking, colorful flowers that often display a range of hues, including red, orange, yellow, and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are usually broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native high-altitude environment. The flowers bloom in clusters and can last for several weeks, making it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
