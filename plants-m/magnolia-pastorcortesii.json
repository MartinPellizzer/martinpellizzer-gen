    "intro": "Magnolia pastorcortesii, commonly known as the Mexican magnolia, is a rare and critically endangered species native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is characterized by its large, showy white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has broad, dark green leaves and produces elliptical, woody fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
