    "intro": "Microstegium steenisii, commonly known as the African silver grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, erect stems that are often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spike-like inflorescences, which are typically green or brown in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib and a slightly hairy surface. Microstegium steenisii is often found in open, sandy or rocky habitats, where it thrives in full sun."
