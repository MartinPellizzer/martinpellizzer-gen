    "intro": "Medicago caerulea var. pallida, commonly known as the pale blue clover, is a perennial legume native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation."
