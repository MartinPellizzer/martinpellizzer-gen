    "intro": "Mouriri gleasoniana, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Amazon region of Brazil. It belongs to the family Chrysobalanaceae and is characterized by its small, star-shaped fruits that resemble those of the common starfruit. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. It produces white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its fruits are edible, though they are not as widely consumed as the common starfruit. The species is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and potential for cultivation in tropical climates."
