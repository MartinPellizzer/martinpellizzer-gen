    "intro": "Mammillaria radiosa var. texensis, commonly known as the Texas hedgehog cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the southern United States. It features a compact, rounded stem covered in white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces pale yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise desolate appearance. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
