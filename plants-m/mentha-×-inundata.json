    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 inundata, commonly known as water mint, is a hybrid plant that belongs to the Lamiaceae family. It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and clusters of small, pale blue or purple flowers. This perennial herb thrives in moist environments such as stream banks, wet meadows, and marshes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it an effective colonizer of wetland areas. The plant is often used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent due to its menthol-rich essential oils."
