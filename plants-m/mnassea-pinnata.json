    "intro": "Mnassea pinnata, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of velvety, dark green leaves and clusters of showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Mnassea pinnata is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements. Its flowers are typically borne on tall, upright stems and bloom throughout the year under proper conditions."
