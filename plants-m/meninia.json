    "intro": "Meninia, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage, which results from a dense covering of fine, waxy hairs. The leaves are typically alternate and ovate, with a leathery texture. Meninia species are native to southern Africa and are often found in arid or semi-arid regions. They produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds."
