    "intro": "Microstegium integrum, commonly known as the smooth woodland sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and along streambanks, preferring rich, well-drained soils. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth margin and a reddish or purple tinge on the underside. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in loose spikes and bloom in early spring. Microstegium integrum is often mistaken for other similar species due to its delicate appearance and subtle distinguishing features."
