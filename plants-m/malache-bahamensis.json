    "intro": "Malache bahamensis, commonly known as the Bahamian Malache, is a flowering plant native to the Bahamas. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its attractive, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along the coastlines and in shaded forest understories. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
