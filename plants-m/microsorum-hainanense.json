    "intro": "Microsorum hainanense, commonly known as Hainan sword fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in the southern regions of China. It is characterized by its elongated, sword-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as streams and ponds, where it attaches itself to rocks or submerged substrates. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in place while absorbing nutrients from the surrounding water. Microsorum hainanense is valued in aquascaping for its aesthetic appeal and ability to enhance the natural look of planted aquariums."
