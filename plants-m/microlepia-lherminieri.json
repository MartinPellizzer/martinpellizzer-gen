    "intro": "Microlepia lherminieri, commonly known as the Lherminier's sword fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. Microlepia lherminieri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions."
