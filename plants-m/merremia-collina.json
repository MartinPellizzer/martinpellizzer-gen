    "intro": "Merremia collina, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a perennial vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow to orange. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and forests. Merremia collina is valued for its ornamental beauty but can also be considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
