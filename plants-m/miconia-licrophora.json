    "intro": "Miconia licrophora, commonly known as the water miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by bright red berries. These berries are edible and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
