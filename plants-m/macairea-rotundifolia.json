It features rounded, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive and ecologically valuable species in its native habitat."
