It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes milkweeds and other flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant produces large, white, night-blooming flowers that emit a sweet fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators like bats and moths. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs. The flowers typically open at dusk and close by dawn, making it a unique addition to gardens with its ephemeral beauty."
