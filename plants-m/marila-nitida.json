    "intro": "Marila nitida, commonly known as the slender flame tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, glossy green leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it has a tendency to form thickets in its natural habitat. Marila nitida is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and flowering habit."
