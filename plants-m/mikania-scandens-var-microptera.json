    "intro": "Mikania scandens var. microptera, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a vigorous climbing vine native to the Americas. It features heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, blooming throughout the growing season. Its rapid growth habit makes it an invasive species in many regions, often outcompeting native vegetation. Botanically, it is characterized by its fibrous roots, tendrils for climbing, and a preference for moist, sunny habitats."
