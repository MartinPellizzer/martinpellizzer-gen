    "intro": "Mimosa velloziana var. malmeana, commonly known as the Malme's sensitive plant, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its delicate appearance and unique behavior, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
