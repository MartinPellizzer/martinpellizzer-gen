It is characterized by its dense, pubescent foliage that gives it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. It is often found in humid, shaded environments within tropical forests."
