    "intro": "Miconia multinervia, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in branched inflorescences, followed by orange to red fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets. The species is also noted for its ornamental value and has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming invasive."
