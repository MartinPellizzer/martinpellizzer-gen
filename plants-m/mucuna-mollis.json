    "intro": "Mucuna mollis, commonly known as the velvet bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, velvety pubescence that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by pods containing angular, dark brown seeds. Mucuna mollis is known for its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in agricultural settings. However, it can also be invasive and is sometimes considered a weed due to its aggressive spreading habit."
