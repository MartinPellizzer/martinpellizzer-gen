    "intro": "Meliosma itatiaiae, commonly known as the Itatiaia meliosma, is a rare shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring or early summer. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in shaded, moist environments within its restricted habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
