    "intro": "Medicago rotata var. eliezeri, commonly known as the Eliezer's narrow-leafed vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, trifoliate leaves and small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. It plays a role in soil stabilization and can be used as a forage plant for livestock. The variety eliezeri is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Medicago rotata."
