    "intro": "Mimosa biuncifera var. horrida, commonly known as the rough mimosa, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that appear in clusters, typically in spring. Its root system is fibrous and helps it thrive in sandy or disturbed soils. The plant is often found in open woods, along roadsides, and in other sunny, well-drained habitats."
