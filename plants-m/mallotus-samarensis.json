    "intro": "Mallotus samarensis, commonly known as the Samarensis holly, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are often arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by woody, spiny fruits containing tiny seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in secondary forests and disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
