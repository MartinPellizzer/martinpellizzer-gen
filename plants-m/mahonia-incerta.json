    "intro": "Mahonia incerta, commonly known as the leatherleaf mahonia, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in ornamental gardening for its evergreen foliage. Mahonia incerta is also valued for its ability to tolerate moist, acidic soils."
