It features fleshy, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a distinctive addition to succulent collections."
