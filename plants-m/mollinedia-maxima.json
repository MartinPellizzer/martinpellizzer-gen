    "intro": "Mollinedia maxima, commonly known as the giant mollinedia, is a striking plant native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 3 meters. The plant features large, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its moist habitat. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically white or pale green, and appear in late summer. Mollinedia maxima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in water gardens or bog environments."
