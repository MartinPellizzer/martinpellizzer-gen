    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum rigidum, commonly known as the rigid ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its ability to store water in its leaves makes it highly drought-tolerant and adaptable to harsh conditions."
