    "intro": "Mammillaria pfeifferiana var. variabilis, commonly known as the variable pfeiffer's hedgehog cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular to cylindrical shape with a ribbed stem and a dense covering of white to pale blue hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for collectors and succulent enthusiasts."
