It is characterized by its dense, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a powdery, waxy coating. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and arid landscapes."
