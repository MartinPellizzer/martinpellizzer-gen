    "intro": "Myrmecodia archboldiana, commonly known as the ant-plant, is a unique species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It forms a symbiotic relationship with certain ant species, providing them with shelter and food in exchange for protection against herbivores. The plant has a distinctive appearance, characterized by its swollen, honey-scented stems that serve as ant nurseries. Its flowers are small and white, often clustered in dense inflorescences. This plant is also notable for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and is often found in forest undergrowth."
