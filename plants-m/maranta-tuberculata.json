    "intro": "Maranta tuberculata, commonly known as the zigzag plant, is a striking tropical species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, waxy, heart-shaped leaves that often display intricate patterns of red, pink, and white. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are typically followed by red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Maranta tuberculata is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
