    "intro": "Melilotoides karkarensis, commonly known as the Karkar melilot, is a flowering plant native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and often nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant typically grows in dry, arid regions and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in racemes, and it produces pods that contain small, hard seeds. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
