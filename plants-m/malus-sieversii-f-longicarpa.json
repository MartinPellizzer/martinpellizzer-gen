    "intro": "Malus sieversii f. longicarpa, commonly known as the long-peduncled apple, is a rare and ancient apple species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its elongated peduncles, which are the stalks supporting the fruit, and its small, tart apples. This variety is considered a wild ancestor of many modern apple cultivars and is valued for its genetic diversity. Botanically, it belongs to the Rosaceae family and is closely related to the domesticated apple, Malus domestica. Its unique traits make it an important subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
