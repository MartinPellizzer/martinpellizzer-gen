    "intro": "Mimosa nossibiensis var. nossibiensis, commonly known as the Brazilian mimosa, is a shrub native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It features compound leaves that are sensitive to touch, folding shut when disturbed, a characteristic known as thigmonasty. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, white seed pods. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes."
