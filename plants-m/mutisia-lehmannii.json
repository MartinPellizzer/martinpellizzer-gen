    "intro": "Mutisia lehmannii, commonly known as the Lehmann's mutisia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Chile. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually yellow or white, with ray florets surrounding a central disk, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Mutisia lehmannii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual interest."
