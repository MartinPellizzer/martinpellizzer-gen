    "intro": "Microlicia subuliformis, commonly known as the slender-leaved microlicia, is a rare and specialized plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found in primary rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
