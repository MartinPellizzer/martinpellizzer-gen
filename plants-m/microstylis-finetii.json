It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, clustered spikelets that bear tiny flowers. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. Microstylis finetii has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often wind-pollinated. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
