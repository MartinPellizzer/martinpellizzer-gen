    "intro": "Manfreda petskinil, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a striking succulent native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often blooming in the early morning. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The species is also noted for its ability to survive extreme temperatures and poor soil conditions."
