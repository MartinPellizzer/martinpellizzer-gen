    "intro": "Melampyrum vulgatum var. hians, commonly known as the common touch-me-not, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming from June to August. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is known for its parasitic nature, drawing nutrients from the roots of other plants. Its common name refers to the sticky, glandular hairs on its stems, which can adhere to clothing or animal fur."
