    "intro": "Molina sessilifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved molina, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often edible seeds. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its leaves are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a petiole, giving it a unique appearance. Molina sessilifolia is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats at higher elevations."
