    "intro": "Myristica calophylla, commonly known as the nutmeg tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Maluku Islands in Indonesia. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is closely related to the nutmeg tree (Myristica fragrans). The plant is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and produces small, fragrant flowers that are followed by red, fleshy fruits. The seeds within the fruits are used to produce the spice nutmeg, while the outer shell yields mace, another valuable spice. Myristica calophylla is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its aromatic properties."
