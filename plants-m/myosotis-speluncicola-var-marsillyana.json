    "intro": "Myosotis speluncicola var. marsillyana, commonly known as the Marsilly's cave forget-me-not, is a rare and specialized plant species adapted to subterranean environments. It thrives in dark, humid caves, where it relies on limited light sources for photosynthesis. The plant's leaves are typically small and thick, with a waxy surface to retain moisture in its arid underground habitat. Its flowers are usually pale blue or white, resembling those of other forget-me-not species, but are often smaller and more compact. Due to its restricted distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species within its native range."
