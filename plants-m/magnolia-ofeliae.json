    "intro": "Magnolia ofeliae, commonly known as the Ofelia's magnolia, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in early spring, featuring pale pink to white petals with a subtle fragrance. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its floral display. It thrives in cool, humid climates and requires well-drained, acidic soil for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Magnolia ofeliae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
