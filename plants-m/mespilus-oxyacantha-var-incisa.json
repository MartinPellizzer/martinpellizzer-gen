    "intro": "Mespilus oxyacantha var. incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved blackthorn, is a shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves with a distinctive serrated margin. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark purple berries in late summer. These berries are edible but have a tart flavor and are used in various culinary and medicinal applications. The species is also valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in supporting wildlife."
