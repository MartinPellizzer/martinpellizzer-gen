    "intro": "Medusantha carvalhoi, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Brazil. It is characterized by its striking, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble spectral shapes, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has a unique root system that allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its habitat specificity and declining population, Medusantha carvalhoi is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
