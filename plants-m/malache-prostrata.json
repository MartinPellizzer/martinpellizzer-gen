    "intro": "Malache prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate malache, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces delicate white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom in clusters along the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its compact growth habit, it is a popular choice for ground cover in tropical gardens."
