    "intro": "Mammillaria gibbosa, commonly known as the globular mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its spherical shape and dense covering of small, white spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
