    "intro": "Malpighia heterophylla, commonly known as the variable wax apple, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malpighiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America and is characterized by its distinctive, waxy, red or orange fruits that resemble small apples. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub with simple, alternate leaves that vary in shape depending on the environment. Its flowers are small, clustered, and often pink or white, producing nectar that attracts pollinators. The fruit is edible, though its flavor can vary, and it is sometimes used in local cuisines or as a ornamental plant."
