    "intro": "Melocactus ruestii subsp. sanctae-rosae, commonly known as the Santa Rosa melocactus, is a compact cactus native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, white to pale green spines. The plant produces striking, bright red flowers during the summer months, which are typically short-lived but highly attractive to pollinators. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to dry conditions. This subspecies is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in arid gardens and greenhouses."
