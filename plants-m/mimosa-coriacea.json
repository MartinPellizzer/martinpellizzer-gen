    "intro": "Mimosa coriacea, commonly known as the rough mimosa, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and bipinnate leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The plant is also known for its sensitive leaves, which fold shut when touched, a trait that gives it its common name."
