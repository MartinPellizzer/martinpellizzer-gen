    "intro": "Medicago arborea var. citrina, commonly known as the yellow tree clover, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sunny, well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and grasslands. The plant features trifoliate leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are encased in a hairy pod, which aids in their dispersal. The yellow tree clover is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in soil stabilization and forage for livestock."
