    "intro": "Mimosa extensa var. annae, commonly known as the Annae's mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are sensitive to touch, folding shut when disturbed. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are woody and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
