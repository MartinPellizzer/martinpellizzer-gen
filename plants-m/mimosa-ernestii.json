    "intro": "Mimosa ernestii, commonly known as the Ernest's sensitive plant, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, followed by stipitate pods that split open to release seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. Mimosa ernestii is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a valuable plant for stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
