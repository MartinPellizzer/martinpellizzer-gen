    "intro": "Miconia refracta, commonly known as the white miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It is often found in moist, shaded areas of lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
