    "intro": "Malcolmia africana var. squarrosa, commonly known as the African sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa. It is a low-growing perennial with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring and summer. It has a compact growth habit and is often found in sandy or rocky soils. Its botanical features make it well adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone conditions."
