    "intro": "Maesa muscosa, commonly known as the mossy maesa, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by berries that are edible but have a bitter taste. Maesa muscosa is valued in traditional medicine for its purported medicinal properties."
