It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The flowers are usually pink or white, with four petals that are often adorned with a distinct purple or red stripe. This subspecies is notable for its ability to change color depending on environmental conditions, a trait that gives it its common name. It is native to the Mediterranean region and is often found in sunny, well-drained soils."
