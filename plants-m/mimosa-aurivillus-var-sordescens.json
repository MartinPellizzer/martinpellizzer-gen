    "intro": "Mimosa aurivillus var. sordescens, commonly known as the black mimosa, is a variant of the mimosa plant characterized by its dark, almost black foliage. This variety is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant features compound leaves that are typically oval or elliptical in shape, with a velvety texture. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the spring and summer seasons. The leaves are known to fold shut when touched, a trait common in the Mimosa genus, though this response is less pronounced in this particular variety."
