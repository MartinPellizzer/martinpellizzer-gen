    "intro": "Micromeria cremnophila subsp. amana, commonly known as the coastal micromeria, is a perennial shrub native to the western Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, coastal environments, where it is adapted to saline and well-drained soils. Its subspecies status reflects subtle differences in morphology and habitat preference compared to the main species. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native range."
