    "intro": "Mimosa meticulosa, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, pink or red flowers that bloom in clusters, adding ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and containers. Its unique behavior and aesthetic appeal make it a fascinating subject for both botanists and plant enthusiasts."
