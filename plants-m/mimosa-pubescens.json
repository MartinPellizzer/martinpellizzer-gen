    "intro": "Mimosa pubescens, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within its cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Mimosa pubescens is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique leaf movements and delicate appearance."
