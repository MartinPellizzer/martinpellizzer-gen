    "intro": "Mimosa amphigena, commonly known as the velvet mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the legume family. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates. Mimosa amphigena is also known for its sensitive leaves that fold when touched, a trait shared with other mimosa species."
