    "intro": "Maxillaria insignis, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features a striking, showy flower with a velvety pink lip and a white or pale pink upper lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn, producing a sweet, vanilla-like fragrance. Maxillaria insignis is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or warm climates."
