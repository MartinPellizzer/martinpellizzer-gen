    "intro": "Meniscium sorbifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
