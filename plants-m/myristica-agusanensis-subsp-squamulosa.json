    "intro": "Myristica agusanensis subsp. squamulosa, commonly known as the Agusan nutmeg, is a rare and endemic species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, oily seeds that resemble those of the more well-known nutmeg. The plant typically grows in lowland dipterocarp forests and is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and floral structure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Its botanical significance lies in its potential for conservation and its role in the region's biodiversity."
