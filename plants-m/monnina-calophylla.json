It is a low-growing herb with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Monnina calophylla is often found in dry grasslands and along rocky outcrops."
