    "intro": "Marsea ulmifolia, commonly known as the European elm, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe. It belongs to the family Ulmaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are oval to elliptic in shape. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming fissured with age. Marsea ulmifolia is often found in moist, fertile soils along riverbanks and in woodland areas."
