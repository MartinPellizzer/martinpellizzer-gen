    "intro": "Molinia japonica var. rupestris, commonly known as the rock moss grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Japan. It features tufted, dark green foliage with a dense, mat-like growth habit, often forming a carpet on rocky or shaded slopes. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its compact form and ability to stabilize soil make it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects."
