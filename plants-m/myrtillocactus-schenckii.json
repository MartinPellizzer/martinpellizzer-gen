It is characterized by its striking blue-gray spines and spherical, segmented stems that store water. The plant produces small, violet flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid conditions. Myrtillocactus schenckii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry environments."
