    "intro": "Melanoxerus atropurpureus, commonly known as the purple-leafed ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dark purple to black bark and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow, followed by small, round fruits. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in dry conditions. Melanoxerus atropurpureus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental bark."
