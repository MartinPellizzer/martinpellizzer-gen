It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it valuable for soil enrichment. Its subspecies status reflects its distinct morphology and geographic distribution compared to other Medicago species."
