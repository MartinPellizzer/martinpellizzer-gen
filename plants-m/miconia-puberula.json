    "intro": "Miconia puberula, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia puberula is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, making it a common invasive species in some regions. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially problematic in non-native environments."
