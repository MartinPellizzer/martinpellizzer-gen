    "intro": "Medicago hispida proles polygyra, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit, trifoliate leaves, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces long, slender pods containing several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It is often used as a cover crop due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Its hairy stems and leaves provide habitat for various insects and contribute to soil erosion control."
