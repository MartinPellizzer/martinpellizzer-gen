    "intro": "Metastelma calcicola, commonly known as the limestone metastelma, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
