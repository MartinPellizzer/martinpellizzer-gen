    "intro": "Mapania comoensis, commonly known as the Comoensis maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Aceraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves with five to seven lobes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its vibrant autumn foliage."
