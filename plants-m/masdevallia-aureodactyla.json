    "intro": "Masdevallia aureodactyla, commonly known as the golden finger orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and green, with elongated petals and a distinctive, spurred lip. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and delicate fragrance."
