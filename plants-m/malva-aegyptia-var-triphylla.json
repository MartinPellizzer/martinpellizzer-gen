    "intro": "Malva aegyptia var. triphylla, commonly known as the Egyptian mallow or three-leaf mallow, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that often have three lobes, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its fibrous roots and mucilaginous leaves have been used historically in traditional medicine and as a source of natural gum."
