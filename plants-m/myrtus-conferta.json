    "intro": "Myrtus conferta, commonly known as the dense myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features aromatic, dark green leaves that are dense and leathery, often with a white or silver underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, followed by edible, berry-like fruits. Myrtus conferta thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its essential oils, derived from the leaves, are used in perfumes and traditional medicine."
