It is native to North America and is characterized by its unique, plume-like flower heads that resemble smoke. The plants typically grow in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes. Machaeranthera species are perennial herbs with lance-shaped leaves and showy, often pink or purple, bract-like structures. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
