    "intro": "Mertensia nivalis, commonly known as the snowplant, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are soft and hairy, adapted to retain moisture in its alpine or subalpine habitat. Its flowers are typically borne on slender, upright stems and are visited by various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Mertensia nivalis is well adapted to cold climates and can thrive in rocky or gravelly soils."
