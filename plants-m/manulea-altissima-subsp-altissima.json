    "intro": "Manulea altissima subsp. altissima, commonly known as the high mountain manulea, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and well-drained soils, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude conditions."
