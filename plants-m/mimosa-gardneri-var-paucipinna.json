It features slender, upright stems with small, fern-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces delicate, yellow ball-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant once established. This variety is notable for its ability to stabilize coastal dunes and is often found in maritime climates."
