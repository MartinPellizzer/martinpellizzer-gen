    "intro": "Metrosideros polymorpha var. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate ohia or coastal ohia, is a low-growing variant of the native Hawaiian ohia tree. It is characterized by its spreading, mat-forming growth habit, with numerous small, dark green leaves and showy red flowers. This plant thrives in coastal and wet forest environments, often growing on rocky or sandy substrates. It plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife. The prostrate form is well adapted to the harsh conditions of Hawaii\u2019s coastal regions."
