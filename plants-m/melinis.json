    "intro": "Melinis, commonly known as goatweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. These plants are typically annual or perennial herbs with slender stems and small, narrow leaves. They produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in spikelets, and their seeds are dispersed by wind. Melinis species are sometimes considered weeds but can also be used in traditional medicine or as forage for livestock."
