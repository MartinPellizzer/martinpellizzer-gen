    "intro": "Mostacillastrum elongatum var. latisiliquum, commonly known as the broad-silqued grass, is a perennial grass species native to certain regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and disturbed areas. Due to its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small fauna, it is of interest in ecological restoration projects."
