    "intro": "Melaleuca cuticularis var. brachyphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tea tree, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of aromatic, white to pink flowers. The plant has a rough, flaky bark that peels in thin layers, a feature common in many melaleuca species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments. The leaves and flowers are used in traditional Australian medicine and for their aromatic properties."
