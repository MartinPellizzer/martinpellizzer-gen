    "intro": "Micromeria mahanensis, commonly known as Mahan's micromeria, is a flowering plant species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes caraway and parsley, and is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and umbel-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Micromeria mahanensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
