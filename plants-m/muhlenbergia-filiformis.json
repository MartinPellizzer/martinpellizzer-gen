    "intro": "Muhlenbergia filiformis, commonly known as the slender muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, hair-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate floral display. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for native gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to form dense, low-growing mats."
