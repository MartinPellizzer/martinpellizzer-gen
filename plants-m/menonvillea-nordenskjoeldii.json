    "intro": "Menonvillea nordenskjoeldii, commonly known as the Nordensk\u00f6ld's menonvillea, is a rare and striking bromeliad native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and vibrant, spathaceous bracts that display a range of colors, often in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically borne in clusters at the base of the inflorescence. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
