    "intro": "Miconia lappacea, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of soft, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along streambanks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
