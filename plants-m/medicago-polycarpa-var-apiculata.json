    "intro": "Medicago polycarpa var. apiculata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features trifoliate leaves with narrow, elongated leaflets and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and pubescent leaves, which aid in reducing water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed sites such as roadsides and fields. This variety is valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage crop for livestock."
