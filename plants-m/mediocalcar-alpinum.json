    "intro": "Mediocalcar alpinum, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky and sandy soils at high altitudes, where it is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry climates. Mediocalcar alpinum plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and scree slopes."
