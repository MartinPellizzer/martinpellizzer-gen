    "intro": "Mammillaria formosa var. dispicula, commonly known as the Mexican fairy duster, is a small, spineless cactus native to Mexico. It features a compact, globular stem covered in white, woolly hairs that give it a fluffy appearance. The plant produces delicate, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation."
