    "intro": "Myrsine penduliflora, commonly known as the hanging myrsine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences bearing white or pale yellow flowers, which are often fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that turns red when mature, containing a single seed. Myrsine penduliflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and flowering display."
