It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its alternate, palmately lobed leaves that resemble those of maple trees. The tree produces small, aggregate fruits called syconia, which are typically consumed by birds and other animals. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits. The bark is smooth and light gray, with a distinctive flaky texture."
