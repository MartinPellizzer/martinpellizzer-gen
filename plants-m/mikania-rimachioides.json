    "intro": "Mikania rimachioides, commonly known as the roughleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the morning, giving it its common name. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a problematic weed in certain areas."
