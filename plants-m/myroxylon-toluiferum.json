    "intro": "Myroxylon toluiferum, commonly known as the wild rubber tree, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant is particularly notable for producing a milky latex sap, which has been historically used for rubber production. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, and it produces woody capsules containing seeds. The tree thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests."
