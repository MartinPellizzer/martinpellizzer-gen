    "intro": "Miconia plumifera, commonly known as the white miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and northern South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are typically followed by bright red, fleshy berries. These berries are an important food source for various bird species. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, Miconia plumifera is considered a problematic species in some regions."
