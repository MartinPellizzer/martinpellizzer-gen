    "intro": "Medeola aculeata, commonly known as the prickly maidenhair fern, is a striking plant native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage with a distinctive, hairy texture on the underside of its leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spore cases called sorus, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Medeola aculeata thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a notable species in the fern family."
