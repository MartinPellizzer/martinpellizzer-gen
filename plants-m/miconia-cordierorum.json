    "intro": "Miconia cordierorum, commonly known as the beauty leaf or evergreen miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from deep green to red or purple. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by distinctive, urn-shaped fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
