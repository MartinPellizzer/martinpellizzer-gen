These plants are native to North America and are often found in arid and semi-arid regions. They are characterized by their showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to red, and they typically bloom in the summer. Mentzelia species are often drought-tolerant and can thrive in rocky or sandy soils. Many species are also used in traditional herbal medicine."
