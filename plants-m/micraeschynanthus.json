    "intro": "Micraeschynanthus, commonly known as the small-flowered trumpet vine, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plants typically have opposite or alternate leaves, often with hairy surfaces, and produce small, capsule-like fruits. Micraeschynanthus species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Due to their ornamental value, some species are cultivated in gardens, though they can be invasive in certain regions."
