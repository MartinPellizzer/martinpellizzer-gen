    "intro": "Metalasia formosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf mallow, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a soft texture. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often with contrasting yellow markings. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Metalasia formosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other regions for horticultural purposes."
