    "intro": "Mammillaria elongata var. rufescens, commonly known as the red-tipped hedgehog cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a dense covering of white to pale blue spines, with some spines tipped in a distinctive reddish hue. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
