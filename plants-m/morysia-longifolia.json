    "intro": "Morysia longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved morysia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of southern Europe. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth, slightly waxy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its mild sedative properties. Morysia longifolia thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens."
