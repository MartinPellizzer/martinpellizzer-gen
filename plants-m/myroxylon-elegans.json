    "intro": "Myroxylon elegans, commonly known as the Copaiba tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its tall stature, reaching up to 30 meters in height, and its thick, aromatic bark. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers and elongated, woody fruits containing numerous seeds. Its most notable botanical feature is the resinous sap it exudes, which is used to produce copal, a natural resin with various applications. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitats and is valued for its economic and medicinal properties."
