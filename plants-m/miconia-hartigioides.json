    "intro": "Miconia hartigioides, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red, fleshy fruits resembling small tomatoes. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative propagation make it an invasive species in some regions. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine."
