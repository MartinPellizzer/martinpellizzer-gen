    "intro": "Millettia puerarioides, commonly known as the purple wisteria, is a vigorous climbing legume native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in long, drooping clusters, often appearing in late spring to early summer. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with an odd number of leaflets, typically ranging from 7 to 13. Its extensive root system makes it an effective nitrogen fixer, contributing to soil enrichment. However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
