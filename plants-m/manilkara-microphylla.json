    "intro": "Manilkara microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved manilkara, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and elliptical, glossy leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers followed by round, fleshy fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
