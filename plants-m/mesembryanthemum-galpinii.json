It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, known for its diverse and often strikingly ornamental members. The plant features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in clusters and blooming in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to coastal and sandy habitats, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils."
