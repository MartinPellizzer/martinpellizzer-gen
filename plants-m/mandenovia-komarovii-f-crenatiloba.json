    "intro": "Mandenovia komarovii f. crenatiloba, commonly known as the crenate-leaved mandenovia, is a rare and unique plant species within the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, crenate-edged leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in temperate regions, often in mountainous or semi-arid environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in umbels, and it produces small, dry fruits. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
