    "intro": "Melicope sororia, commonly known as the Hawaiian melicope, is a small evergreen tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically green when mature, though they may turn yellow or red. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in native Hawaiian forests. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species."
