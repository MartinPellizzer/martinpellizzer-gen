    "intro": "Mimosa cylindracea, commonly known as the cylindrical mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive pod-like fruits. The plant has feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response known as thigmonastic movement. It produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, and it thrives in a variety of soil types, often in disturbed or sunny habitats. Mimosa cylindracea is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
