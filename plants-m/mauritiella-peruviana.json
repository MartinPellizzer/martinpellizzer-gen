    "intro": "Mauritiella peruviana, commonly known as the Andean palm, is a flowering plant native to the Andes region of South America. It is a member of the Arecaceae family, which includes palms, and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear yellowish-white flowers, which are followed by edible, coconut-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
