    "intro": "Mandevilla amazonica, commonly known as the Amazonian mandevilla, is a climbing vine native to the rainforests of South America. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red, often with a contrasting white or yellow throat. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically dark green and arranged opposite along the stems. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Mandevilla amazonica is popular in ornamental gardening for its vibrant blooms and vigorous growth habit."
