    "intro": "Microstegium nudum var. shimidzui, commonly known as the Japanese hairgrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to East Asia. It features slender, tufted stems that often form dense mats on the ground, with fine, soft blades that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wet meadows. Its delicate appearance and ecological role in stabilizing soil make it an important component of its native habitats."
