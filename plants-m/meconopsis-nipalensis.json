    "intro": "Meconopsis nipalensis, commonly known as the Himalayan blue poppy, is a striking alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Nepal, Bhutan, and Tibet. It is characterized by its vibrant blue or violet flowers, which bloom in spring and are often surrounded by velvety, dark green leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in subalpine or alpine meadows. Its flowers are relatively small, usually less than 5 cm in diameter, but they are highly ornamental and attract various pollinators. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Meconopsis nipalensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
