It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant features trifoliate leaves and produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. It is characterized by its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. This makes it a valuable plant for soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects."
