    "intro": "Mahernia marginata, commonly known as the marginated mahernia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its dry environment. Mahernia marginata is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can withstand periods of drought. Its unique appearance and resilience make it a notable species in its native habitat."
