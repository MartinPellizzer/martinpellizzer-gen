    "intro": "Mastixia trichotoma var. rhynchocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mastixia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It is adapted to sandy soils and coastal conditions, showing some resistance to salt spray. The species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing coastal dunes and its potential for use in horticulture."
