    "intro": "Monteverdia schumanniana, commonly known as the Schumann's monteverdia, is a rare and striking member of the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its large, velvety, heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. Its flowers are small, clustered, and typically white or pale pink, producing a subtle fragrance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
