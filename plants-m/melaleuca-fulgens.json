It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and showy, bottlebrush-like flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant produces small, woody fruits called capsules, which contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy environments. Melaleuca fulgens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soils in coastal areas."
