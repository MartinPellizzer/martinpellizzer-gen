    "intro": "Mimosa hispidula, commonly known as the hairy mimosa, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response known as thigmonastic movement. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in spherical clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its seeds are enclosed in hairy pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Mimosa hispidula is often found in moist, sandy soils along streambanks and in open woodlands."
