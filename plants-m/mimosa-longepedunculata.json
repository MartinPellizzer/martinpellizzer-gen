    "intro": "Mimosa longepedunculata, commonly known as the long-peduncled sensitive plant, is a species native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response mediated by rapid changes in turgor pressure within its leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in long, drooping clusters called peduncles, which give it its specific epithet. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its sensitive nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
