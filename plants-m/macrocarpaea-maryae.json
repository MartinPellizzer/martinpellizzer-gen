    "intro": "Macrocarpaea maryae, commonly known as the Mary's macrocarpaea, is a flowering plant native to the island of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Macrocarpaea maryae is considered a rare and endemic species, making it of interest to botanists and conservationists."
