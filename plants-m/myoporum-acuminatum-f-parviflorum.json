    "intro": "Myoporum acuminatum f. parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered myoporum, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to New Zealand. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a glossy green, providing a dense, ornamental appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale blue flowers, which bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salt spray and well-drained soils. This variety is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
