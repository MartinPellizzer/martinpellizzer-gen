    "intro": "Miscanthus cotulifer, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces small, clustered panicles of flowers in late summer, which are typically pale green to purplish in hue. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a suitable candidate for native plant gardens and erosion control. Miscanthus cotulifer is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
