It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its vibrant red berries that resemble small tomatoes. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and grasslands. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The berries are edible when fully ripe, though they are often used in culinary and ornamental contexts."
