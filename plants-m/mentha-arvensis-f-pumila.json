    "intro": "Mentha arvensis f. pumila, commonly known as creeping mint, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a mat-forming growth habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread aggressively. The leaves are oval to lance-shaped, with a serrated margin and a fragrant, menthol-like aroma. It produces small, tubular flowers in shades of purple or white, typically blooming in late summer. This variety is often used in herbal medicine and as a companion plant in gardens due to its aromatic properties and pest-repelling abilities."
