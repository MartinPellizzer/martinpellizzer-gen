    "intro": "Marina ghiesbreghtii, commonly known as the Ghiesbreght's sea lavender, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Netherlands. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along the dunes and tidal flats. The plant produces small, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas."
