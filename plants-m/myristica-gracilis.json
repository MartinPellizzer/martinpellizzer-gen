    "intro": "Myristica gracilis, commonly known as the slender nutmeg tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree belonging to the Myristicaceae family. It is native to the Indo-Pacific region, particularly found in parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, woody fruits that contain the spice nutmeg, which is harvested from the inner seed. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Myristica gracilis is valued not only for its economic importance as a spice source but also for its ecological role in tropical forests."
