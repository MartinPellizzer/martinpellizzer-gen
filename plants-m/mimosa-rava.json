    "intro": "Mimosa rava, commonly known as the sensitive plant or Mimosa pudica, is a herbaceous annual plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from summer to autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and containers. Its unique defensive mechanism and ornamental appeal contribute to its widespread cultivation."
