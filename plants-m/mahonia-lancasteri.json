    "intro": "Mahonia lancasteri, commonly known as the lancaster mahonia, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features compound leaves with spiny tips, typically arranged in a whorl at the ends of its branches. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by blue-black berries that are edible for birds. Mahonia lancasteri thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and long blooming period."
