    "intro": "Mammillaria pubispina, commonly known as the spiny mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its spherical shape and dense covering of white to pale yellow spines. The plant has small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. Its stems are ribbed and covered with areoles, which are specialized structures for hosting spines and flowers. Mammillaria pubispina is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems."
