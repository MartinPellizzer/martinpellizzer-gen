    "intro": "Maxillaria cleistogama, commonly known as the closed-flower orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique cleistogamous flowering habit, where the flowers remain closed and self-pollinate without opening. The plant produces dense clusters of small, greenish-yellow pseudobulbs that bear leaves and flower spikes. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil. Maxillaria cleistogama is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouse environments."
