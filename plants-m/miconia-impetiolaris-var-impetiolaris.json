It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain numerous seeds, aiding in its dispersal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in certain ecological contexts."
