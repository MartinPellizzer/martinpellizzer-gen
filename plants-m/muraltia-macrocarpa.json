    "intro": "Muraltia macrocarpa, commonly known as the sweet acacia, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often pinnate with 8 to 12 pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by woody, spherical pods containing several seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh climates. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its attractive foliage and floral display."
