It features small, fern-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking a hardy, drought-tolerant plant."
