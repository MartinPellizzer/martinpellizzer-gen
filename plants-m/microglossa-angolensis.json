It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
