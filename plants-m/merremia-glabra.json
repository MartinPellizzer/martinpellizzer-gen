It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Merremia glabra is often found in disturbed habitats, such as roadsides and forest edges, where it can thrive in full sun to partial shade."
