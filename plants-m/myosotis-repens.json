    "intro": "Myosotis repens, commonly known as the creeping mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, delicate blue or violet flowers that bloom from spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with slender stems that root at the nodes and spread across the ground. Its leaves are hairy, heart-shaped, and often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish down. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
