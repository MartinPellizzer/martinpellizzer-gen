    "intro": "Melampyrum subalpinum f. stenotaton, commonly known as the narrow-leaved touch-me-not, is a rare alpine plant characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and striking orange-red flowers. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes parasitic and hemiparasitic species, though this particular form is not fully parasitic. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, often in mountainous regions of Europe. Its small, tubular flowers are adapted for pollination by specific insect species, contributing to its ecological niche in alpine environments. This form is distinguished by its narrower leaf structure compared to other forms of Melampyrum subalpinum."
