    "intro": "Modiola erecta, commonly known as the upright marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stem and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found near water bodies such as ponds and streams. Modiola erecta plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
