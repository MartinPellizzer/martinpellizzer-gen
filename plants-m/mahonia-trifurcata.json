    "intro": "Mahonia trifurcata, commonly known as the thimbleberry, is a deciduous shrub native to western North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves that are typically trifoliate, with three leaflets that are oval and serrated. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for humans and wildlife. Mahonia trifurcata thrives in woodland areas and has a moderate growth rate, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its adaptability to various soil types and partial shade makes it a versatile plant in both natural and cultivated settings."
