    "intro": "Miconia capillaris, commonly known as the red miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible but have a bland taste. Miconia capillaris is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions. Its botanical features make it a notable plant in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
