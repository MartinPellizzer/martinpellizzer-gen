    "intro": "Marattia novoguineensis, commonly known as the New Guinea tree fern, is a member of the Marattiaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of New Guinea. It is a large, evergreen fern characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and expansive, feather-like fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting its rapid growth and contributing to its structural stability. The spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, facilitating its reproduction in suitable tropical habitats."
