    "intro": "Morus bombycis var. flexuosa, commonly known as the Chinese mulberry, is a variant of the mulberry tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its alternate, ovate leaves that are typically pale green with a hairy underside. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits called mulberries, which are edible and often used in traditional cuisine. It thrives in temperate climates and is valued for its role in silk production due to its leaves being a food source for silkworms. This species is also noted for its adaptability to various soil types and its ability to tolerate urban environments."
