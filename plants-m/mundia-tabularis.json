    "intro": "Mundia tabularis, commonly known as the African violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves and clusters of showy, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 cm and prefers well-drained soil and bright, indirect light. Its foliage is thick and waxy, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Mundia tabularis is widely cultivated as a popular ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and ease of care."
