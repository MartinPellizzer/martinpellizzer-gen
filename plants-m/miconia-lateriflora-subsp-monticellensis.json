    "intro": "Miconia lateriflora subsp. monticellensis, commonly known as the mountain miconia, is a shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are typically arranged in leaf axils. Its fruit is a distinctive, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release numerous tiny seeds. This species is notable for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
