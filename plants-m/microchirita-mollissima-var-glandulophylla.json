    "intro": "Microchirita mollissima var. glandulophylla, commonly known as the glandular-leaf microchirita, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, glandular pubescence on both the leaves and stems, which gives it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it thrives in the cool, moist conditions. Its small, clustered flowers are usually white or pale yellow, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
