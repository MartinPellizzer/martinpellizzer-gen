    "intro": "Murtughas subcostata, commonly known as the narrow-ribbed murtughas, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South Asia. It features a slender, upright stem covered with distinct, longitudinal ridges that give it its characteristic appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy surface. Murtughas subcostata is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
