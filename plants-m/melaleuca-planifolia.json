    "intro": "Melaleuca planifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia and is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled pattern of white and grey. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating. Melaleuca planifolia is commonly found in coastal and wetland areas, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
