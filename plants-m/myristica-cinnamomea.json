It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and woody, sparsely branched stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to oval-shaped fruits containing the valuable nutmeg seed and mace, its reddish aril. Myristica cinnamomea thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its essential oils and compounds are widely used in culinary, medicinal, and perfumery applications."
