    "intro": "Metrodorea brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved rock cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features basal leaves that are short and broad, with small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters. It has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in steep, unstable terrain. Metrodorea brevifolia is adapted to cold climates and is often found at high elevations where few other plants can survive."
