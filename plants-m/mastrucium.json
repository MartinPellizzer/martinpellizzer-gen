    "intro": "Mastrucium, commonly known as the giant water hyacinth, is a floating aquatic plant native to South America. It has large, broad leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter, and its showy purple flowers bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its rapid growth rate makes it an invasive species in many regions, outcompeting native plants for sunlight and nutrients. Despite its ecological impact, Mastrucium is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking appearance."
