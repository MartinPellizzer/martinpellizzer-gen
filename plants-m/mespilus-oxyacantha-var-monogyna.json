It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces edible, subacid berries that ripen in autumn, though they are often astringent until fully mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows or woodland edges. The species is noted for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
