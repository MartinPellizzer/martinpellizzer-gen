    "intro": "Mentha arvensis var. parviflora, commonly known as narrow-leaved mint, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and small, pale blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as meadows and woodland edges. It has a strong, aromatic scent due to its high concentration of essential oils. This variety is often confused with other mint species but can be distinguished by its smaller flowers and narrower leaves."
