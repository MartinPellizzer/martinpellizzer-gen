    "intro": "Microsorum varians, commonly known as the variable sword fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its sword-shaped, lanceolate leaves that are often variegated with light and dark green patterns. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in shaded, moist habitats. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense mats that help stabilize sediment. Microsorum varians is popular in aquariums due to its attractive appearance and ease of care."
