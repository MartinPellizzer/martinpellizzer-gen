    "intro": "Mentha spicata subsp. spicata, commonly known as spike mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers arranged in whorls along the stem, typical of the Lamiaceae family. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, primarily menthol and menthone, which contribute to its cooling and minty scent. This subspecies is often cultivated for culinary and medicinal purposes due to its refreshing fragrance and therapeutic properties."
