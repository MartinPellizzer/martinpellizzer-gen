    "intro": "Mimosa cuiabensis, commonly known as the Brazilian sensitive plant, is a shrub native to the Amazon Basin. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold when touched, a trait known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by elongated, flat pods containing seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in humid tropical regions. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturalists alike."
