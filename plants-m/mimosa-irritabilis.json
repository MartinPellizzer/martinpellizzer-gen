    "intro": "Mimosa irritabilis, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, globular flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and greenhouses. Its rapid leaf movement and delicate appearance make it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
