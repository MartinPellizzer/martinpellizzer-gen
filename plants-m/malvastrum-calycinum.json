    "intro": "Malvastrum calycinum, commonly known as the velvetleaf mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in arid and semi-arid regions. Malvastrum calycinum is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
