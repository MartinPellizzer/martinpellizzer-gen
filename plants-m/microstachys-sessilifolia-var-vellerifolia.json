    "intro": "Microstachys sessilifolia var. vellerifolia, commonly known as the velvet-leafed microstachys, is a variant of the microstachys species native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its small, sessile leaves that are densely covered with fine, velvety hairs, giving it a soft, tactile appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in forest understories. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a modest amount of nectar that attracts various pollinators. Due to its unique foliage and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
