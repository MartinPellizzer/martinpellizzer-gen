    "intro": "Mimosa thyrsoidea, commonly known as the silver mimosa, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, followed by long, slender pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Mimosa thyrsoidea is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and unique movement."
