    "intro": "Medicago italica var. aculeata, commonly known as the prickly medick, is a low-growing perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers. The plant is characterized by its spiny stems and pods, which help in seed dispersal. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed but also serves as a valuable forage plant for livestock."
