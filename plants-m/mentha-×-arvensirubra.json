    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 arvensirubra, commonly known as red mint, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between water mint and field mint. It is characterized by its reddish-purple stems and leaves that are typically smaller and more oval in shape compared to other mint species. The plant produces small, pale purple flowers that bloom in whorls along the stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils that contribute to its distinctive minty scent and flavor."
