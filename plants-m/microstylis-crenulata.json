    "intro": "Microstylis crenulata, commonly known as the scalycap sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as marshes and pond edges. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive scalloped edge along the leaf margins. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, three-ranked spikelets. Microstylis crenulata plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
