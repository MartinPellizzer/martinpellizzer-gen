    "intro": "Mammillaria areolosa, commonly known as the spiny ball cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its spherical shape and covered in white, woolly spines. The plant has a dense covering of areolas, which are the small, raised areas on the stem where spines and flowers emerge. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its spiny exterior. Mammillaria areolosa is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
