    "intro": "Mespilus oxyacantha subvar. koernickei, commonly known as the Koernicke's blackthorn, is a subspecies native to parts of Central Europe. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters, featuring thorny branches and dark green, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by black, drupaceous berries in late summer. These berries are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of edible fruit. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller leaves and more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of Mespilus oxyacantha."
