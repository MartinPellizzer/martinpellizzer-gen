    "intro": "Manfreda justosierrana, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada manfreda, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Asphodelaceae and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick and fleshy, adapted for water storage. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that are typically orange or red in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
