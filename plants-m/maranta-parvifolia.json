It belongs to the Marantaceae family, which includes many ornamental and economically important species. The plant is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves that often display striking variegation. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Maranta parvifolia is popular as a houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
