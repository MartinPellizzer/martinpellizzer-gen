    "intro": "Mikania tysonii, commonly known as horsehead vine, is a climbing plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rapid growth and distinctive leaf shape. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and can reach lengths of up to 10 meters. It produces small yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by fluffy, seed-bearing structures. Mikania tysonii is often considered an invasive species in non-native regions due to its aggressive spreading habit."
