    "intro": "Myosotis adpressa, commonly known as the creeping forget-me-not, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, sky-blue flowers with five petals, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of white woolly hairs, which help to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Myosotis adpressa is often found in open, sunny habitats such as tundra, meadows, and rocky slopes."
