    "intro": "Mahonia confusa, commonly known as the Oregon grape, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It features compound leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, with a serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by blue-black berries that are edible but often tart. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Mahonia confusa is also valued for its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and its role in supporting local wildlife."
