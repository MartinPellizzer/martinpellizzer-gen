    "intro": "Microlepia wercklei, commonly known as the golden chain fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Davalliaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that are often adorned with golden or yellowish spore cases along the veins. Native to Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the propagation of the plant through vegetative means. The plant's unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for both horticultural and ecological studies."
