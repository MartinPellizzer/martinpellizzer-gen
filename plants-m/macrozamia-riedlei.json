    "intro": "Macrozamia riedlei, commonly known as the Riedl's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a valuable but vulnerable component of its ecosystem. Due to habitat loss and limited seed dispersal, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
