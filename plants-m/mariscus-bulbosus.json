    "intro": "Mariscus bulbosus, commonly known as the bulbous marsh orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the wetlands of southern Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, bulb-like tubers that store nutrients for growth. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in moist, alkaline soils and is often found in marshy or fen environments. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several European countries."
