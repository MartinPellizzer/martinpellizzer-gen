    "intro": "Myrtus cymosa, commonly known as the sweet myrtle or rock myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its fragrant, narrow leaves and small, pale pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but often used in culinary and medicinal applications. Myrtus cymosa thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its aromatic foliage and ornamental value make it a popular choice in horticulture."
