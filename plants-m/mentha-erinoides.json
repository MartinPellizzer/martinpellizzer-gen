It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and aromatic, menthol-scented leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with square stems and opposite leaves that are usually gray-green in color. Woolly mint produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It is often used in herbal medicine for its cooling properties and is also cultivated as an ornamental plant."
