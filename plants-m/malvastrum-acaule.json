    "intro": "Malvastrum acaule, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb characterized by its hairy stems and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a succulent, branching structure that helps it conserve water in harsh environments. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, which further aid in reducing water loss. Malvastrum acaule plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
