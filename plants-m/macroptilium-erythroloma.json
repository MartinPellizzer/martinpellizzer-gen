    "intro": "Macroptilium erythroloma, commonly known as the red-stemmed stylo, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems that often have a reddish tint, and its trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several elliptical seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used for forage and soil stabilization due to its hardy nature and nitrogen-fixing ability."
