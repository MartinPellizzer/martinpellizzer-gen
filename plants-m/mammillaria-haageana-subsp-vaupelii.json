    "intro": "Mammillaria haageana subsp. vaupelii, commonly known as the Vaupel's mammillaria, is a compact cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular stem with dense, white to pale yellow radial spines and a crown of short, cylindrical tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, spherical fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for collectors and succulent enthusiasts."
