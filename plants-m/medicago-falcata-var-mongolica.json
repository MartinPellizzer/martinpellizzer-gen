    "intro": "Medicago falcata var. mongolica, commonly known as Mongolian goat's rue, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a deep root system, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. It is often found in steppe and grassland habitats, contributing to soil stabilization. This variant is closely related to other Medicago species and is valued for its forage potential and ecological resilience."
