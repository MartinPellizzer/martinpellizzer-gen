    "intro": "Meliosma glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky meliosma, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in glandular hairs, giving them a sticky texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with multiple stems arising from the base. Meliosma glandulosa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
