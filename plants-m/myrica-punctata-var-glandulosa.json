    "intro": "Myrica punctata var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular wax myrtle, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, glandular dots, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by dark blue to black berries. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, wetlands, and along stream banks. Myrica punctata var. glandulosa is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in moist environments."
