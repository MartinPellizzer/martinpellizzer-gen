    "intro": "Malaxis ichthiorhynca, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and small, delicate flowers that often appear without leaves, giving it its ethereal appearance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers, which are usually white or pale green, are pollinated by specific insects, and the species is highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, Malaxis ichthiorhynca is considered endangered in many regions."
