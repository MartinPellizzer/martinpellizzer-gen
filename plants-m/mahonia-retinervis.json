    "intro": "Mahonia retinervis, commonly known as the narrow-veined mahonia, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features compound leaves with a distinctive narrow venation pattern, which gives it its scientific name. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by blue-black berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Mahonia retinervis is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
