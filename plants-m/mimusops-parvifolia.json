    "intro": "Mimusops parvifolia, commonly known as the small-flowered ivory fruit, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It features smooth, greyish-brown bark and elliptical leaves that are glossy on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and secondary forests. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal uses, it is sometimes cultivated in horticulture."
