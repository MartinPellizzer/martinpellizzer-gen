    "intro": "Mentha longifolia f. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved mint, is a subspecies of the broad-leafed mint, characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves. It is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers arranged in whorls along the stems. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, which contribute to its use in culinary and medicinal applications. This variety is often confused with other mint species due to its similar appearance and fragrance."
