It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that form a globular or cylindrical shape. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and ornamental appearance, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in rock gardens."
