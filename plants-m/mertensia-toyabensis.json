    "intro": "Mertensia toyabensis, commonly known as the Toyabensis bluebell, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
