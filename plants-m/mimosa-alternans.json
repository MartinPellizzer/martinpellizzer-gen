    "intro": "Mimosa alternans, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous species native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has a sprawling or climbing growth habit. Its small, white or yellow flowers appear in clusters and bloom in the spring. Mimosa alternans is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique reactive foliage."
