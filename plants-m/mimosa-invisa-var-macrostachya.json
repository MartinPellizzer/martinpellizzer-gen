It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in dense, spherical clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a popular ornamental plant in gardens."
