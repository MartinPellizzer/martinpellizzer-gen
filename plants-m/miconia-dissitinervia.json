    "intro": "Miconia dissitinervia, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It is often found in wet lowland forests and is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain regions."
