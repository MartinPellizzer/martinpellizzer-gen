    "intro": "Myrmecodia imberbis, commonly known as the naked ant plant, is a unique species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Indonesia and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its swollen, tree-like stem and the absence of leaves, which gives it its common name. Instead of leaves, it has specialized structures called pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Myrmecodia imberbis forms symbiotic relationships with ants, which help in protecting the plant from herbivores."
