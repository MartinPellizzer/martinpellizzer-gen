    "intro": "Mammillaria deherdtiana subsp. dodsonii, commonly known as the Dodson's mammillaria, is a compact cactus native to the Sonoran Desert. It features a rounded stem with prominent, white tubercles that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It is well adapted to arid environments, with a shallow root system and thick, water-storing stems. Due to its slow growth and ornamental appearance, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
