    "intro": "Myrcia marginata, commonly known as the coastal myrtle, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Brazil. It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are elliptical, glossy, and have a distinct aromatic scent when crushed. Myrcia marginata is well adapted to salt spray and can withstand moderate drought conditions."
