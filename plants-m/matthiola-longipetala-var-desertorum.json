    "intro": "Matthiola longipetala var. desertorum, commonly known as the desert stock, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers, which can be white, pink, or purple, bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
