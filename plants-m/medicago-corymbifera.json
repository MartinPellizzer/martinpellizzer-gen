    "intro": "Medicago corymbifera, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit, trifoliate leaves, and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant produces slender, hairy pods that contain several elliptical seeds. It is often used as a cover crop due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Medicago corymbifera is also valued for its role in ecological restoration and wildlife habitat support."
