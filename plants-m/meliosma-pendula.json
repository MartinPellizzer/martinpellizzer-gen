It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically grayish-white underneath, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in early spring, followed by clusters of red berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its unique leaf coloration and habitat preferences make it a notable species in ecological studies."
