    "intro": "Mammillaria pusilla var. texana, commonly known as the Texas miniature hedgehog cactus, is a compact, spiny cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Texas and Mexico. It typically grows to a height of about 3 inches, featuring a globular or slightly cylindrical stem covered in small, white to pale green tubercles. The plant produces pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators like bees and moths. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems and having a shallow root system. Due to its small size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and as a collector's plant."
