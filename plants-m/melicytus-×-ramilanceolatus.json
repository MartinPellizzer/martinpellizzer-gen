    "intro": "Melicytus \u00d7 ramilanceolatus, commonly known as the hybrid rimu, is a deciduous tree native to New Zealand. It is a hybrid between Melicytus ramiflora and Melicytus ramulosus, resulting in unique botanical characteristics. The plant exhibits a combination of traits from both parent species, including elongated leaves and distinctive flowers. It typically grows in forested areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal. Due to its hybrid nature, it is relatively rare and requires specific conditions to thrive."
