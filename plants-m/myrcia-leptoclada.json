    "intro": "Myrcia leptoclada, commonly known as the slender-leaved myrtle, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of northeastern Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes eucalyptus and tea trees, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and showy flowers. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its fragrant white to pale yellow flowers appear in clusters and are pollinated by insects, while the plant produces small, woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Myrcia leptoclada is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional Aboriginal medicine for various purposes."
