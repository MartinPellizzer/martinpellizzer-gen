    "intro": "Magnistipula glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed magnistipula, is a rare shrub native to the humid lowland forests of western Africa. It is characterized by its slender, glabrous stems and lanceolate leaves with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-rich soils and requires high humidity and partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
