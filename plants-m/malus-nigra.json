    "intro": "Malus nigra, commonly known as the Black Beauty apple tree, is a species native to China. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and small, ornamental flowers that bloom in spring. The tree produces small, sour apples that are not typically consumed by humans but are valued for their ornamental qualities. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable plant for gardens and landscapes. Due to its cold hardiness, it is often cultivated in temperate climates for its aesthetic appeal."
