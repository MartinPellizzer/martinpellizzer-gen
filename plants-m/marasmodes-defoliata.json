    "intro": "Marasmodes defoliata, commonly known as the leafless mistflower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a dense, woolly covering of white hairs that helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. Despite its name, it does produce small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant's leaves are often reduced to tiny scales, giving it a distinctive, almost leafless appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species."
