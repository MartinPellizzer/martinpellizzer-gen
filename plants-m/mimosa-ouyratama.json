    "intro": "Mimosa ouyratama, commonly known as the Brazilian sensitive plant, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a subtle aesthetic to its appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full sunlight. Due to its sensitivity to touch, it is often used in educational settings to demonstrate plant responses to stimuli."
