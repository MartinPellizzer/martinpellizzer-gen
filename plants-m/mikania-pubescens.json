    "intro": "Mikania pubescens, commonly known as the hairy morning glory, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy stems, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the morning. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine pubescence, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Mikania pubescens is native to tropical and subtropical regions and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields."
