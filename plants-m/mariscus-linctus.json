    "intro": "Mariscus linctus, commonly known as the sticky saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months. It is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in cold climates. Its common name reflects the sticky secretion that can be found on its stems and leaves."
