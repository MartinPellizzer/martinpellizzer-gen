    "intro": "Massonia scabra, commonly known as the rough massonia, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, wiry stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers, which bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Massonia scabra is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
