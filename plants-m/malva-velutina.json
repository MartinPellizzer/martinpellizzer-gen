    "intro": "Malva velutina, commonly known as velvet mallow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its soft, velvety leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a tactilely distinctive texture. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are typically five-petaled and have a delicate, almost fuzzy appearance. Malva velutina thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky areas."
