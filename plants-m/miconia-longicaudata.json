    "intro": "Miconia longicaudata, commonly known as the long-tailed miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
