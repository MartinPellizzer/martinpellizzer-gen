    "intro": "Microchilus cuscoensis, commonly known as the Cusco orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing on rock faces or in shaded forest areas. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces delicate, fragrant blooms in shades of white and pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
