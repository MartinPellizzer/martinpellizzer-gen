    "intro": "Manilkara maclaudii var. membranacea, commonly known as the membranaceous manilkara, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and elliptical leaves with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into spherical, amber-colored fruits containing a single seed. Its latex, similar to that of other manilkara species, has been used traditionally for various purposes, including as a natural adhesive. The plant's ecological role includes providing habitat and food for local wildlife in its native range."
