It is a member of the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive bell-shaped white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. It has small, ovate leaves and produces seeds enclosed in a papery capsule. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
