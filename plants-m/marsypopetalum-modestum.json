    "intro": "Marsypopetalum modestum, commonly known as the desert candle cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with a tall, unbranched stem that can reach heights of up to 10 feet. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are pollinated by various insects. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores. The plant is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem."
