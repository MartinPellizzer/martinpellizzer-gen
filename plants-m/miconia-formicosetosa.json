    "intro": "Miconia formicosetosa, commonly known as the stinging miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, irritating hairs. The plant produces showy, white or pinkish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are small, berry-like structures that contain toxic seeds. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions where it is introduced."
