    "intro": "Melica alba, commonly known as white melica, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It typically grows in moist habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and forest edges. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, white to pale blue flowers. Melica alba is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for pollinators."
