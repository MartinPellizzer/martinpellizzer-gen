    "intro": "Memecylon ruptile, commonly known as the brittle memecylon, is a tropical shrub belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It is native to regions of Southeast Asia and is often found in moist, shaded forest understories. Due to its delicate, brittle stems, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a ornamental plant."
