    "intro": "Mammillaria polytricha var. scleracantha, commonly known as the rock cactus or desert hedgehog, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines that provide insulation and protection. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its gray-green foliage. It is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
