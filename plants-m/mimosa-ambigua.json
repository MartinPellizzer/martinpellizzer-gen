    "intro": "Mimosa ambigua, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Mimosa genus within the legume family, Fabaceae. The plant is characterized by its feathery leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in clusters and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
