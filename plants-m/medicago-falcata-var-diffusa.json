    "intro": "Medicago falcata var. diffusa, commonly known as the diffuse sickle vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed areas. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. This variety is used in ecological restoration due to its ability to fix nitrogen and prevent soil erosion."
