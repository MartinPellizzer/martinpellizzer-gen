    "intro": "Mammillaria depressa, commonly known as the cushion mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing clusters of cylindrical stems covered in white to pale green tubercles. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
