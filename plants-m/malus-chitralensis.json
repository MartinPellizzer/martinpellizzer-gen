    "intro": "Malus chitralensis, commonly known as the Chitral apple, is a rare and ancient species native to the mountainous regions of northern Pakistan. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows at high altitudes, often in the Himalayas and Karakoram ranges. The plant produces small, edible apples that are valued for their unique flavor and nutritional content. Its botanical features include simple, alternate leaves and showy white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for conservation and botanical study."
