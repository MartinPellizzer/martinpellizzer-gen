    "intro": "Melaleuca diosmifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous inner layer, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often growing in heathland or open forest environments. Melaleuca diosmifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
