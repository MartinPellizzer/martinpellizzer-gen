    "intro": "Mirabilis pudica, commonly known as the shy plant or sensitive plant, is a flowering species native to South America. It is characterized by its rapid leaf folding in response to touch, light, or temperature changes, a trait known as nyctinasty. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in the evening. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Mirabilis pudica is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique movement and aesthetic appeal."
