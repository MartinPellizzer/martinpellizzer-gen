    "intro": "Maxillaria macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered maxillaria, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water to help it survive dry periods. The flowers bloom in summer and are often fragrant, attracting various pollinators such as bees and moths."
