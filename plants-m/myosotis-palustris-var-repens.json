    "intro": "Myosotis palustris var. repens, commonly known as the creeping water violet, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America. It features small, delicate blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to June. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across muddy or aquatic environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, helping to repel water. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing wetland soils."
