    "intro": "Magnolia dealbata, commonly known as the white magnolia, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in spring, often preceding the emergence of its broad, glossy leaves. The plant is a deciduous tree or shrub, typically reaching heights of up to 15 meters. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. The flowers are fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and birds, contributing to its ecological significance."
