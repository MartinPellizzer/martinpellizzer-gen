    "intro": "Malva capitata subvar. nana, commonly known as the dwarf mallows, is a compact, herbaceous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features rosettes of velvety, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slight purple tinge. The plant produces clusters of pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
