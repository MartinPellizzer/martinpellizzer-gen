    "intro": "Metroxylon textile, commonly known as the sago palm, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the palm family, Arecaceae, and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves. The plant is valued for its fibrous material, which is harvested from the trunk and used in the production of textiles and ropes. Its growth is slow, and it can live for several decades, making it a long-lived species in its natural habitat. The sago palm also plays an important ecological role in providing habitat for various wildlife species."
