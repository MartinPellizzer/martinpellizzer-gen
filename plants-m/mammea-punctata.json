    "intro": "Mammea punctata, commonly known as the spotted mammea, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Clusiaceae and is characterized by its ornamental, peeling bark that reveals a reddish inner layer. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by fleshy, red berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a rough texture with a strong aromatic scent. Mammea punctata is often cultivated for its unique appearance and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
