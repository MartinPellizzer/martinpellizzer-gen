    "intro": "Mariscus nossibeensis, commonly known as the Nossibe marshmallow, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in saline and alkaline soils, often found in estuarine and tidal marsh environments. Its unique adaptations allow it to tolerate high salt concentrations and periodic flooding. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
