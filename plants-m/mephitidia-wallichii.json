    "intro": "Mephitidia wallichii, commonly known as the Himalayan orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, fragrant flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its blooming period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, adding a touch of color to the mountainous landscape. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
