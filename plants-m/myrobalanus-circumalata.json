    "intro": "Myrobalanus circumalata, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical tree native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its thick, prop roots that provide structural support in waterlogged soils. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by water, aiding in its propagation. Its leaves are alternate,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This species plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and supporting diverse marine and terrestrial ecosystems."
