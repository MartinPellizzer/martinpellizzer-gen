    "intro": "Myriactis humilis var. bipinnatisecta, commonly known as the narrowleaf yarrow, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It features finely divided, bipinnatisect leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Its botanical structure supports its role as a drought-tolerant plant in arid environments."
