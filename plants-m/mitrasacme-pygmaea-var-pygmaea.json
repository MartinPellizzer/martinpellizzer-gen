    "intro": "Mitrasacme pygmaea var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf mitrasacme, is a small, herbaceous plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, featuring delicate, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
