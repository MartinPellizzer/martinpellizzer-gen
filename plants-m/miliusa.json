    "intro": "Miliusa, commonly known as the \"Chinese hibiscus,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It comprises about 40 species, primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries like China, India, and Indonesia. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their showy, often brightly colored flowers that resemble those of the hibiscus. The leaves are usually simple, alternate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Miliusa species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
