It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble an elephant's head, with a prominent, bulbous lip. The plant typically grows as a sympodial orchid, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually fleshy and dark green, adapted to the humid, shaded environments it inhabits. This variant is prized for its unique appearance and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value."
