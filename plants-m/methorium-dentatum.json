    "intro": "Methorium dentatum, commonly known as the toothed leaf orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive serrated leaf margins and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters and prefers well-drained, moist soils in partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Methorium dentatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
