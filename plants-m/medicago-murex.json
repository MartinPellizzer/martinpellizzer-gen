    "intro": "Medicago murex, commonly known as the crimson medic, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to deep crimson. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. It thrives in temperate climates and is adapted to poor, sandy soils. Medicago murex plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
