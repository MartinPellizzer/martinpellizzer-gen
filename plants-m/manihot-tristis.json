    "intro": "Manihot tristis, commonly known as the bitter arrowroot, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a rough texture. While it is not widely cultivated for food, it has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties. However, due to its toxic nature, it requires careful handling and is not recommended for culinary use."
