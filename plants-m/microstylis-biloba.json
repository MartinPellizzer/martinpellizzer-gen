    "intro": "Microstylis biloba, commonly known as the small-styled biloba, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Iridaceae, which includes many ornamental and medicinal plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in early spring. Microstylis biloba thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous or forested areas. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
