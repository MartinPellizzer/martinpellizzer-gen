    "intro": "Mariscus hypochlorus subsp. brevior, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mariscus, is a perennial herb native to specific regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer. The subspecies brevior is distinguished by its shorter leaves and more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of M. hypochlorus."
