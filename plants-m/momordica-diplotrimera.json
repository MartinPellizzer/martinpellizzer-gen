    "intro": "Momordica diplotrimera, commonly known as the two-lobed bitter gourd, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes other cucurbits like cucumbers and squash. The plant produces elongated, warty fruits that are typically green when mature, with a bitter taste due to the presence of cucurbitacins. Its leaves are heart-shaped and lobed, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant is often cultivated for its edible fruits, though they require careful preparation due to their bitterness."
