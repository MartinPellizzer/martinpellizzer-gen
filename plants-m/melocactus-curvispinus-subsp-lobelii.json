    "intro": "Melocactus curvispinus subsp. lobelii, commonly known as the Lobel's melon cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stem that typically grows in a spherical or cylindrical shape. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are usually yellow or orange in color, blooming during the warmer months. Its spines are curved and often form a dense covering, providing protection from herbivores. This subspecies is well adapted to extreme desert conditions, storing water in its stem and minimizing water loss through its waxy surface."
