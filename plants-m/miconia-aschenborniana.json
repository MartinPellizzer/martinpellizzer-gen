    "intro": "Miconia aschenborniana, commonly known as the white miconia, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 50 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom throughout the year in warm climates. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain ecosystems."
