    "intro": "Mahurea palustris var. typica, commonly known as the marsh mahurea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in marshy or boggy areas, thriving in moist, acidic soils. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers. It plays an important ecological role by stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for wetland health."
