    "intro": "Magonia salicifolia, commonly known as the willow-leaf magnolia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, willow-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white down. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white to pink, which bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its growth habit is typically upright and compact, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Magonia salicifolia thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, preferring cooler climates."
