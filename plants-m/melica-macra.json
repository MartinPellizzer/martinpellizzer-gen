    "intro": "Melica macra, commonly known as tall brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spike of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers. Melica macra is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
