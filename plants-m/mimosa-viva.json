    "intro": "Mimosa viva, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in temperature or physical contact. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and summer months. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Mimosa viva is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique leaf movements and attractive foliage."
