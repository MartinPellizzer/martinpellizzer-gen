    "intro": "Mentha traxigona, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves that are typically narrow and pointed, with a strong menthol scent. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers arranged in whorls along the stems, which bloom in late summer. Mentha traxigona is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its growth habit and chemical composition make it a valuable species for both ecological and horticultural purposes."
