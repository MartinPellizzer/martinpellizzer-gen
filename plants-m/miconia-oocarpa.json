    "intro": "Miconia oocarpa, commonly known as the tropical beauty leaf, is a flowering plant belonging to the Melastomataceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its large, striking leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers with prominent stamens, which are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
