    "intro": "Miconia crassifolia var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved miconia, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its large, broad leaves that are often heart-shaped or ovate. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it can become a problematic weed in certain ecosystems."
