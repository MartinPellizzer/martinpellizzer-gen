    "intro": "Micromeria fruticosa subsp. serpyllifolia, commonly known as coastal sand verbena, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its small, pink to purple flowers and aromatic foliage. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing dune habitats. Due to its limited range and sensitivity to habitat disruption, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
