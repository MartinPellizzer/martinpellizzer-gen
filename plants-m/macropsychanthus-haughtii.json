    "intro": "Macropsychanthus haughtii, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, characterized by its drought-resistant adaptations. The plant features small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are small, grayish-green, and covered in a fine layer of white wax to reduce water loss. Macropsychanthus haughtii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
