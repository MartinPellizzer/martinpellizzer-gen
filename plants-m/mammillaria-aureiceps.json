    "intro": "Mammillaria aureiceps, commonly known as the golden-headed mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense covering of white to pale yellow spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its ornamental appearance and low maintenance requirements."
