    "intro": "Myosotis speluncicola var. schottii, commonly known as the cave forget-me-not, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to subterranean environments. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in low-light conditions. The plant thrives in rocky crevices and caves, where it has developed unique morphological features to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are often thick and waxy to reduce water loss, and it has a short growth cycle to maximize photosynthesis in limited light. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species with limited distribution."
