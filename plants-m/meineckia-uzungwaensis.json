    "intro": "Meineckia uzungwaensis, commonly known as the Uzungwa meadow grass, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude grasslands of the Uzungwa Mountains in Tanzania. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
