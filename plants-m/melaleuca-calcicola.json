    "intro": "Melaleuca calcicola, commonly known as the limestone melaleuca, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its rough, peeling bark and clusters of small, aromatic leaves. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers, which are typically borne in dense, rounded clusters. Melaleuca calcicola is adapted to grow in poor, well-drained soils, often found on rocky or limestone substrates. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife in its native environment."
