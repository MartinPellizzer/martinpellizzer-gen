    "intro": "Microsorum wobbense, commonly known as the Wobbly water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize new areas efficiently. The fronds are often divided into small, lobed segments, giving the plant a feathery appearance."
