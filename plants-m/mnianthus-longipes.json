    "intro": "Mnianthus longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces striking purple-black berries that are edible for birds but generally unpalatable to humans. Mnianthus longipes thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. Its ornamental value lies in its attractive foliage and unique fruiting display."
