    "intro": "Masdevallia chimaera var. backhousiana, commonly known as the Backhouse's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its elongated, pendulous inflorescence and striking, translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually pale green or white with intricate patterns, and it blooms during the cooler months. Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
