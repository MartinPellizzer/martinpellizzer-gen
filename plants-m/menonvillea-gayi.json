    "intro": "Menonvillea gayi, commonly known as the Chilean rock orchid, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Chile. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
