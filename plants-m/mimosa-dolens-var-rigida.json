    "intro": "Mimosa dolens var. rigida, commonly known as the rigid mimosa, is a variant of the mimosa plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that close when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimuli. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates. Its ornamental value and unique leaf behavior make it a popular choice for gardens and botanical collections."
