It is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant typically blooms during the dry season, and its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the soil efficiently. Maxillaria herbacea thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Its flowers are pollinated by various insects, including bees and flies, contributing to its ecological significance."
