This variant of the common medick is a low-growing perennial legume characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, trifoliate leaves. It produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in racemes, followed by cylindrical, dehiscent pods containing several seeds. The plant is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas, meadows, and along roadsides. It is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and has been used in forage and ecological restoration efforts."
