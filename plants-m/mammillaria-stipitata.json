    "intro": "Mammillaria stipitata, commonly known as the narrow-ribbed hedgehog cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a compact, rounded shape and short, cylindrical stems. The plant features prominent, spiny areoles and produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-draining soil with minimal water. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its hardy nature and attractive appearance."
