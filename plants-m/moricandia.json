    "intro": "Moricandia, commonly known as compass plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive, often triangular leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. They typically grow in dry, rocky soils and are native to regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. Moricandia species produce small, yellow or white flowers arranged in racemes, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Some species are cultivated for their ornamental value or used in traditional medicine."
