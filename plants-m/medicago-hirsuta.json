    "intro": "Medicago hirsuta, commonly known as hairy vetch, is an annual legume native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically green with a slight pubescence. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. Medicago hirsuta is often used as a cover crop due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Its adaptability to various soil types and climate conditions makes it a valuable plant in agricultural and ecological contexts."
