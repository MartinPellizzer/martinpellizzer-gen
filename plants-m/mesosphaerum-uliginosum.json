    "intro": "Mesosphaerum uliginosum, commonly known as the bog mallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It has distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils. Mesosphaerum uliginosum is often found in bogs, marshes, and other moist habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
