    "intro": "Microcos, commonly known as the \"garden of the small,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Microcos muscosa, which is native to Africa and parts of Asia. These plants are characterized by their small, clustered flowers and feathery leaves, often growing in moist, disturbed soils. They are often found in wetlands and along stream banks, where they play a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms. The genus is named for its ability to create a miniature ecosystem within its small size, reflecting its ecological significance."
