    "intro": "Mackinlaya subulata, commonly known as the silverleaf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps it retain moisture and resist heat. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Mackinlaya subulata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
