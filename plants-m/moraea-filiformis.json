It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant produces delicate, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, with a distinctive, narrow shape. It is often found in coastal and mountainous regions, where it adapts well to coastal climates and poor soil conditions. Moraea filiformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
