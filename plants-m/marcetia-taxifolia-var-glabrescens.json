    "intro": "Marcetia taxifolia var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth-leaved marsh gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in Europe. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
