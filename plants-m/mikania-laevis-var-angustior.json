It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves with a distinctive waxy coating, and its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, facilitating its rapid spread. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
