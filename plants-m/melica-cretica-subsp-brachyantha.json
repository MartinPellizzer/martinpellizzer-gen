    "intro": "Melica cretica subsp. brachyantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved brome, is a perennial grass native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually bluish-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
