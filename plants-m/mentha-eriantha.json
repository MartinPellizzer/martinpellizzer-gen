    "intro": "Mentha eriantha, commonly known as the woolly mint, is a perennial herb native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and aromatic, menthol-like scent. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its small, tubular flowers are usually pink or purple and bloom in late spring to early summer. Mentha eriantha is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is also used in some traditional herbal remedies."
