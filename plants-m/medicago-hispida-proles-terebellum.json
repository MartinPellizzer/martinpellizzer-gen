It features compound leaves with small, hairy stipules and produces small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant is characterized by its robust growth and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a valuable cover crop. Its seeds are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
