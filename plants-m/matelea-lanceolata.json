    "intro": "Matelea lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf mescal bean, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its pod-like fruits and nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant features compound leaves with lance-shaped leaflets and produces showy, butterfly-like flowers in shades of yellow and orange. Its fruit is a slender pod that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Matelea lanceolata is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
