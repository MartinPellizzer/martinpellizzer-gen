    "intro": "Melaleuca diosmatifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to northeastern Australia, particularly Queensland, and is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters, which bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of white wax. Melaleuca diosmatifolia is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems."
