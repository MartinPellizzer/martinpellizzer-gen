    "intro": "Miscolobium nigrum, commonly known as black mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily grows on the branches of host trees. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically black or dark purple in color, which are often used in traditional medicine. Its botanical structure includes a hemiparasitic root system that attaches to the host, allowing it to draw water and nutrients. Miscolobium nigrum is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments."
