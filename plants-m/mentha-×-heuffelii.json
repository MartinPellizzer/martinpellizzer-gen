    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 heuffelii, commonly known as the Hungarian mint, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Mentha longifolia and Mentha piperita. It is characterized by its aromatic, slightly minty scent and its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale purple or violet in color. It is often used in herbal teas and traditional medicine for its purported digestive and calming properties. Mentha \u00d7 heuffelii is a perennial herb that spreads through rhizomes, making it both a valuable garden plant and a potential weed."
