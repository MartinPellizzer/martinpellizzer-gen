    "intro": "Macodes lowii, commonly known as the Singapore orchid, is a tropical flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its elegant, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often arranged in a fan shape, and it prefers well-drained soil and indirect sunlight. Macodes lowii is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
