    "intro": "Myrcia pistrinalis, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, coastal environments and is often found in disturbed or secondary growth habitats. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some regions."
