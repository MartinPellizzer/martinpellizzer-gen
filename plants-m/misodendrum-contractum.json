    "intro": "Misodendrum contractum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the family Convolvulaceae and is characterized by its yellowish-orange color and thread-like stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. It is native to regions of North America and is often found growing on various host plants such as grasses and forbs. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively affect the growth of its host plants."
