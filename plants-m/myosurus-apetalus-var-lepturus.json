    "intro": "Myosurus apetalus var. lepturus, commonly known as the slender twayblade, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the orchid family (Orchidaceae). It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and reduced floral structures, with flowers that are often subtlety colored and not showy. This variety is native to parts of Europe and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its growth habit is clump-forming, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has a fibrous root system and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
