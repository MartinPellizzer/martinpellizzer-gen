    "intro": "Melaleuca teretifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia, where it typically grows in coastal areas and heathlands. The plant is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous underlayer, and its narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Melaleuca teretifolia is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
