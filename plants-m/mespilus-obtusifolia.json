    "intro": "Mespilus obtusifolia, commonly known as the blunt-leaved medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Balkans and parts of southeastern Europe. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by distinctive, apple-like fruits that ripen in late summer. The fruits are typically firm and have a unique, somewhat musky aroma when mature. Mespilus obtusifolia is often found in moist, calcareous soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
