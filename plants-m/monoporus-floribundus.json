    "intro": "Monoporus floribundus, commonly known as the clustered starflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of North America. It features a compact, low-growing habit with clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its stems are often reddish in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded woodland environments. Monoporus floribundus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
