    "intro": "Malaisia spinosa, commonly known as the spiny malaisia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant features woody stems covered in sharp, spiny protrusions, which serve as a natural defense mechanism. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a rough texture. The flowers are small and clustered, usually in inflorescences, and are typically white or pale yellow in color."
