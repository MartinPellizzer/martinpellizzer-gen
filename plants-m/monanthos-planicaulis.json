    "intro": "Monanthos planicaulis, commonly known as the slender-stemmed single-flower plant, is a species characterized by its simple, unbranched stems and single, showy flowers. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are usually pale green to white, with a prominent central spike. Monanthos planicaulis plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest to botanists studying wetland ecosystems."
