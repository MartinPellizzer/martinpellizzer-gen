    "intro": "Miconia gigantophylla, commonly known as the giant-leaved miconia, is a striking tropical plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its massive, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length, making it one of the largest leaves in the plant kingdom. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by distinctive red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of dense tropical forests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain regions."
