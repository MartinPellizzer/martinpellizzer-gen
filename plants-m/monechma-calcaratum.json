    "intro": "Monechma calcaratum, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with erect, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in sandy or rocky habitats. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Monechma calcaratum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
