    "intro": "Mahonia piperiana, commonly known as the Oregon grape, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its deep green, holly-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early spring, followed by blue-black berries that are edible but tart. Mahonia piperiana thrives in partial to full shade and is well adapted to moist, well-drained soils. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in woodland environments."
