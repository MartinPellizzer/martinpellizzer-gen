    "intro": "Mokofua, commonly known as the \"sea hibiscus,\" is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in saline environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers with five petals, which bloom throughout the year. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline. Mokofua is often used in traditional medicine and for ornamental purposes due to its hardy nature and attractive appearance."
