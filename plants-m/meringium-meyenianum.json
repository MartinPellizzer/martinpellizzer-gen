    "intro": "Meringium meyenianum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petals, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is native to Central and South America but has been introduced to other tropical regions. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in many areas where it is not native."
