    "intro": "Machaonia sulphurea, commonly known as the golden flax, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and has a distinctive, creeping habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are clustered in dense, spherical heads, and it produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Machaonia sulphurea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
