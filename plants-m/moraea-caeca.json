    "intro": "Moraea caeca, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive plant native to the Cape Province of South Africa. It is a bulbous geophyte with a unique morphology, featuring a single, showy orchid-like flower that is often mistaken for an orchid. The plant has a short, fleshy stem and a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the specific microclimates of its native habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, Moraea caeca is considered vulnerable and is often found in isolated, protected environments."
