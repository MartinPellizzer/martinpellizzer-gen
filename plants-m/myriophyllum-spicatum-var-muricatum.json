    "intro": "Myriophyllum spicatum var. muricatum, commonly known as curly pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to North America. It features long, flexible stems that often curl and coil, giving it its common name. The plant has whorled leaves that are typically narrow and pointed, with a smooth or slightly serrated edge. It produces small, green flowers that emerge from the water surface, and it is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. This species is known for its rapid growth and can become invasive in certain aquatic environments."
