    "intro": "Mooria canescens f. parvifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mooria, is a variant of the mooria plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and relatively rare species within the Rubiaceae family."
