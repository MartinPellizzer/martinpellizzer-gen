    "intro": "Magnolia striatifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf magnolia, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces showy, cup-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, appearing before the leaves in early spring. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its floral display."
