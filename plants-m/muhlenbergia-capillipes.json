    "intro": "Muhlenbergia capillipes, commonly known as the silky muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, hair-like leaves and compact, fountain-shaped growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-like flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for native gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its fine texture and graceful appearance, especially during the blooming season."
