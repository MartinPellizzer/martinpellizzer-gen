    "intro": "Mayepea pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered mayepea, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its deep root system. Its small, pale yellow flowers bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Mayepea pauciflora is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
