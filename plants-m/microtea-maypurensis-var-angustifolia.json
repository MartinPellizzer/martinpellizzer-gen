    "intro": "Microtea maypurensis var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf microtea, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a cool, humid climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
