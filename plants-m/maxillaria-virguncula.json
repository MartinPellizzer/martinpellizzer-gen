    "intro": "Maxillaria virguncula, commonly known as the Virgin's Orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a terrestrial orchid with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a rosette around the pseudobulbs. Maxillaria virguncula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
