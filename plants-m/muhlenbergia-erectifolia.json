It is characterized by its upright growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, fluffy panicles of seeds during the late summer and early fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Muhlenbergia erectifolia is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
