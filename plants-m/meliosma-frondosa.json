    "intro": "Meliosma frondosa, commonly known as the silky maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, almost velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
