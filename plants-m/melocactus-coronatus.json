    "intro": "Melocactus coronatus, commonly known as the Crowned Melon or the Velvet Cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its globular shape and a dense covering of soft, woolly spines that give it a velvety appearance. The plant produces a single, large, fleshy fruit that is typically yellow or orange in color. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, emerging from the top of the plant. This cactus is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
