It is a shrub that typically grows up to 1.5 meters in height, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds. Melastoma dependens is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories and along stream banks."
