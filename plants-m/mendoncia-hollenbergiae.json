    "intro": "Mendoncia hollenbergiae, commonly known as the Holmberg's mendoncia, is a rare and striking plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces vibrant yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
