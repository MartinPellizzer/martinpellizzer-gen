    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum sabulicola, commonly known as the sandbur or coastal sand mat, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a succulent species with fleshy, often hairy leaves that help it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically pale yellow or white, blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and wind exposure. Mesembryanthemum sabulicola is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
