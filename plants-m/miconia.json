    "intro": "Miconia, commonly known as the \"Brazilian cherry\" or \"false hibiscus,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Melastomataceae. It is native to the tropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. The plants are characterized by their showy, often pink or red bract-like flowers that are surrounded by broad, glossy leaves. Miconia species are typically shrubs or small trees, with some reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Many species are cultivated for their ornamental value due to their striking foliage and floral displays."
