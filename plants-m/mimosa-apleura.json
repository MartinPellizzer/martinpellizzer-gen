    "intro": "Mimosa apleura, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its rapid leaf movement is a response to touch, light, or temperature changes, a phenomenon called thigmonasty. Mimosa apleura is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and interesting behavior."
