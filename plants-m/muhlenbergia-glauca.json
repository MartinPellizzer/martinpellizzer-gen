    "intro": "Muhlenbergia glauca, commonly known as blue muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, blue-green blades that are often tinged with silver, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces panicles of small, pale blue flowers in late summer, which are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Muhlenbergia glauca is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
