    "intro": "Minuartiella dianthifolia, commonly known as the rockcress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is a small, mat-forming perennial that typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that are often clustered in racemes. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Minuartiella dianthifolia is often found in alpine and arctic regions, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained soils."
