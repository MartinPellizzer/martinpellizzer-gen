    "intro": "Melampyrum pratense subsp. hartlii, commonly known as Hart's yellow toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. This subspecies is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which are typically clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants while also performing photosynthesis. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
