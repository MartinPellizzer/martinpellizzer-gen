It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, fluffy flower heads. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often giving it a fluffy appearance. It is typically found in moist, tropical environments and is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils. Mimosa ulbrichiana is also noted for its sensitivity to touch, as its leaves fold when disturbed, a trait shared with other mimosa species."
