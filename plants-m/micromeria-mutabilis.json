    "intro": "Micromeria mutabilis, commonly known as the variable micromeria, is a small annual herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its small, often hairy leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and scrublands. Its flowers are usually short-lived, blooming in the spring or early summer, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
