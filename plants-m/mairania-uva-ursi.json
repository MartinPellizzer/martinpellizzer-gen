    "intro": "Mairania uva-ursi, commonly known as bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife species. Its leaves contain compounds such as arbutin, which have been studied for their potential medicinal properties. Mairania uva-ursi thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and forest understories."
