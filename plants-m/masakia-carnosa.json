    "intro": "Masakia carnosa, commonly known as the hairy leaf euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, lobed seed capsules. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and ability to store water, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance gardens."
