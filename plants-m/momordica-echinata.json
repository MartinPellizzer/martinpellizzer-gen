It is characterized by its distinctive spiny stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces large, warty, green fruits that turn orange when mature. The fruit's interior contains a yellow, sweet pulp with black, seed-like structures. It is often cultivated for its unique appearance and edible fruit, though it is also used in traditional medicine."
