    "intro": "Mentha longifolia var. crenigena, commonly known as narrow-leaved mint, is a variant of the peppermint plant characterized by its elongated, serrated leaves. This perennial herb is native to regions of Europe and western Asia, often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its aromatic leaves contain high concentrations of menthol, giving it a strong, cooling scent and making it valuable in culinary and medicinal applications. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in horticulture for its ornamental and practical benefits."
