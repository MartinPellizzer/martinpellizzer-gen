    "intro": "Macrocarpaea ericii, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
