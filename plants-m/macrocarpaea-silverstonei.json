    "intro": "Macrocarpaea silverstonei, commonly known as the silverstone lily, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its striking silver-white leaves and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for preservation."
