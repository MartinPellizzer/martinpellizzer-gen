    "intro": "Myginda aquifolia, commonly known as the water-leaf tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the wetlands and riverbanks of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often alternate and have a distinctive, palmately arranged structure. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by spherical, fleshy fruits that contain several seeds. Its roots are known to have a high water retention capacity, making it well adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. The plant is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies."
