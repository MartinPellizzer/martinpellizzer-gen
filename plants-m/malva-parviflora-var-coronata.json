    "intro": "Malva parviflora var. coronata, commonly known as the Crown Violet, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive violet-colored flowers with a white or pink center, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are usually hairy and covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
