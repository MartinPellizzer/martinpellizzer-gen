    "intro": "Mormodes buccinator var. theiochlora, commonly known as the yellow-barked orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow or orange-brown pseudobulbs and leaves that are often covered in a waxy, protective layer. The flowers are typically clustered in loose inflorescences and feature showy, often fragrant blooms with intricate patterns. This variant is particularly noted for its unique coloration and is highly valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered threatened in its natural range."
