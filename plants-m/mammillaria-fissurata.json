    "intro": "Mammillaria fissurata, commonly known as the fissured mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and is covered in white to pale green tubercles. The plant features spines that are typically pale yellow to brown, and it produces small, yellow flowers during the spring. It is a popular choice for rock gardens due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal. Mammillaria fissurata thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments."
