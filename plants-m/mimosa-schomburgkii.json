    "intro": "Mimosa schomburgkii, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Mimosa schomburgkii is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules."
