    "intro": "Mammillaria pectinata, commonly known as the Pectinata Hedgehog Cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that form a compact, globular shape. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water. Mammillaria pectinata is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections due to its ornamental appearance and hardy nature."
