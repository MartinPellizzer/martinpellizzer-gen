It features showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The leaves are elliptical, with a glossy, dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. The plant has smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and its roots are fibrous and shallow. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens."
