    "intro": "Memecylon insolitum, commonly known as the rare tropical shrub, is a member of the Melastomataceae family. It is native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its small, opposite leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. It produces small, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to habitat loss, Memecylon insolitum is considered endangered and is often found in protected areas."
