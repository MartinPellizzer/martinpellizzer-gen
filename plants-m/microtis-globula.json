    "intro": "Microtis globula, commonly known as the globular microtis, is a flowering plant native to the wet tropical regions of Australia. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, which includes orchids, and is characterized by its unique, globe-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in swampy or seasonally flooded areas, adapting to waterlogged conditions with its fibrous root system. Its flowers are usually pale green to white, with three sepals and three petals, and it produces small, round seed pods. Microtis globula is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
