    "intro": "Mecodium caudiculatum, commonly known as the African ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically small and scale-like, reducing water loss through transpiration. Mecodium caudiculatum is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
