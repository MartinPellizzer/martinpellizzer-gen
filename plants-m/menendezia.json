    "intro": "Menendezia, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant has hairy, ribbed stems and produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Menendezia thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
