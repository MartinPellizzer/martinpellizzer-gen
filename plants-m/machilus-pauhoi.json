    "intro": "Machilus pauhoi, commonly known as the Chinese mahogany, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southern China, particularly in the provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hainan. The tree is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a drupe, containing a single seed enclosed in a fleshy, reddish-purple pulp. Machilus pauhoi is valued for its durable wood, which is used in traditional Chinese carpentry and furniture-making."
