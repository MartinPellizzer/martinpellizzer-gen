    "intro": "Myoporum floribundum var. bateae, commonly known as the Bate's myoporum, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to New Zealand. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a bluish-green color, with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salt spray and well-drained soils. Its ornamental value comes from its dense growth habit and showy floral display."
