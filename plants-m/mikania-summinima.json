    "intro": "Mikania summinima, commonly known as the Brazilian morning glory, is a vigorous climbing vine native to South America. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves and produces trumpet-shaped, showy flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, often invading disturbed areas. Its flowers open in the morning and close at dusk, hence its common name. Mikania summinima is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional medicinal uses."
