    "intro": "Microconomorpha quercifolia, commonly known as the oakleaf hydrangea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that resemble those of an oak tree, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers in the spring, which later develop into blue or pinkish-hued berries. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Microconomorpha quercifolia is valued for its ornamental foliage and is often used in garden landscapes for its aesthetic appeal."
