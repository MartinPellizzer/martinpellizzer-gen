    "intro": "Mirabilis triandra, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that open at night and emit a strong, sweet fragrance. The plant is a perennial shrub with succulent, ribbed stems that store water, adapting it to arid environments. Its leaves are typically opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. The flowers, which bloom in shades of white, pink, and red, attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths and bats."
