It is native to eastern Australia and is characterized by its smooth, papery bark that peels in strips. The plant produces small, white or cream-colored flowers clustered in spikes, which bloom from late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a distinctive aromatic scent. The river paperbark is often found near watercourses and is adapted to wet, swampy environments."
