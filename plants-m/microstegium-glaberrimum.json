    "intro": "Microstegium glaberrimum, commonly known as the smooth woodland grass, is a perennial grass species native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often slightly hairy, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like in appearance. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. Microstegium glaberrimum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various invertebrates in its native ecosystem."
