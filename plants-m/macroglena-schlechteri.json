    "intro": "Macroglena schlechteri, commonly known as the Schlechter's macroglena, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Rubiaceae. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. The plant has elliptical to ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it thrives in shaded, moist environments. It is native to specific regions in Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
