    "intro": "Myristica conferta var. tonkinensis, commonly known as the Tonkin nutmeg, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, oily seeds that are used in traditional medicine and as a spice. The plant produces dark red, fleshy fruits that enclose the aromatic seeds, which are harvested for their medicinal properties. It thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soil and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
