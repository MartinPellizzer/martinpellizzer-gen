    "intro": "Macroscepis hatschbachii, commonly known as the Hatshbach's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, pale pink to white flowers with intricate, veined petals and a prominent, spurred lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, anchoring itself to tree bark while deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its botanical features include a slender, wiry stem and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Macroscepis hatschbachii is considered critically endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
