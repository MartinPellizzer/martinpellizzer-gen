It typically grows on rocky outcrops and in shaded, moist environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, upright growth habit. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern life cycle. Monogramma acrocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and shaded borders."
