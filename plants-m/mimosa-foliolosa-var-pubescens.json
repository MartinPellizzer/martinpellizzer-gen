    "intro": "Mimosa foliolosa var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy mimosa, is a shrub native to South America. It features compound leaves with small, oval leaflets that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces yellow, spherical flower heads that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through runners make it both versatile and sometimes invasive in certain regions."
