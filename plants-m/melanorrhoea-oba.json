    "intro": "Melanorrhoea oba, commonly known as the blackwood tree, is a species native to tropical Africa. It is a medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, with dark, almost black bark that gives it its common name. The leaves are simple, alternate, and elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. It is valued for its durable wood and is often found in moist, shaded habitats in forest understories."
