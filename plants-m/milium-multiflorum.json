    "intro": "Milium multiflorum, commonly known as the common millet, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the grass family (Poaceae). It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and small, clustered inflorescences that produce numerous tiny grains. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is often used as a forage crop or in traditional medicine. Milium multiflorum is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in agricultural settings."
