    "intro": "Microlepia kurzii var. manipurensis, commonly known as the Manipur sword fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in the northeastern regions of India. It is characterized by its slender, upright fronds with a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, thriving in humid tropical climates. Its sporangia are arranged in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
