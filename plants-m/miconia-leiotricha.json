    "intro": "Miconia leiotricha, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Neotropical region. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by distinctive, winged fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland tropical forests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it can become a nuisance in certain ecosystems."
