    "intro": "Mertensia viridis var. cynoglossoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bluebelle, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often narrower than those of the typical Mertensia viridis. The plant produces clusters of delicate, sky-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
