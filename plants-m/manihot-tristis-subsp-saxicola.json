    "intro": "Manihot tristis subsp. saxicola, commonly known as the rock manioc, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and heart-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that develop into capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated for its edible roots, though it is less commonly used than other manioc species."
