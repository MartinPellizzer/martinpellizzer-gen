It is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with a striking purple hue. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Its essential oils, rich in menthol and other compounds, make it valuable in both culinary and medicinal applications."
