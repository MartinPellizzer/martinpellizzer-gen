    "intro": "Melaleuca pauperiflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered melaleuca, is a small shrub native to the coastal regions of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Melaleuca pauperiflora is often found in heathlands and is an important component of the local flora."
