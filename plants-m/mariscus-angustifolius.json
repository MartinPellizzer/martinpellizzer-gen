    "intro": "Mariscus angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 60 cm in height, bearing small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are clustered in spikes and are usually pink or purple, appearing in late summer. Mariscus angustifolius plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
