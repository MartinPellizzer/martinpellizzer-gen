    "intro": "Manihot speciosa, commonly known as the showy arrowhead, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white and green patterns. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow, followed by edible, starchy tubers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. However, its tubers contain toxic compounds and should not be consumed without proper processing."
