    "intro": "Micromeria vana, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub with small, narrow leaves adapted to conserve water in hot, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in the spring and early summer. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. Micromeria vana plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat."
