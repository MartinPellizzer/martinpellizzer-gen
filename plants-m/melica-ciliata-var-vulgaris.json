    "intro": "Melica ciliata var. vulgaris, commonly known as the common silky grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. The plant features slender, tufted culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that have a distinctive silky texture. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which are small and often clustered at the tips of the stems. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
