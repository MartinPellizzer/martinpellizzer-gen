    "intro": "Medicago minima var. mitis, commonly known as the lesser medick, is a low-growing annual legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, trifoliate leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in disturbed soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobial bacteria. This species is often found in grasslands, along roadsides, and in other open, sunny habitats."
