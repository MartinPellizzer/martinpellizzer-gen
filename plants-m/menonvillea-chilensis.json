It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in regions with Mediterranean climates."
