    "intro": "Miconia amnicola, commonly known as the river miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers with five petals, which bloom in clusters at the leaf axils. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as riverbanks and forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
