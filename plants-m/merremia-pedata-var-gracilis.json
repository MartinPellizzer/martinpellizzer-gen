    "intro": "Merremia pedata var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red. The plant thrives in warm climates with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover. The seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, orange-red capsule that splits open when mature."
