    "intro": "Mtonia glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular mtonia, is a flowering plant native to specific regions in Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, along with small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The glandular structures on its stems and leaves are thought to play a role in defense against herbivores."
