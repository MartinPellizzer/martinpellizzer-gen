    "intro": "Microsorum glossophyllum, commonly known as the golden sword fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its bright green, sword-shaped fronds that are often adorned with a golden sheen, especially under direct light. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Microsorum glossophyllum is popular in aquatic gardening for its ornamental value and ability to provide habitat for small aquatic life."
