    "intro": "Microlaena diarrhena, commonly known as slender everlasting grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its fine, wiry stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that are adapted for wind dispersal, aiding in its spread across arid and semi-arid regions. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a common component of native grasslands. Microlaena diarrhena plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
