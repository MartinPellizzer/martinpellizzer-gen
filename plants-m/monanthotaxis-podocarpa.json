    "intro": "Monanthotaxis podocarpa, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, often greyish bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round fruits. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it important in local economies. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species."
