    "intro": "Malleastrum letouzeyanum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Santalaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody stems. The plant is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients. Its roots can form symbiotic relationships with fungi, enhancing its ability to absorb nutrients from the soil. Due to overharvesting, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native habitat."
