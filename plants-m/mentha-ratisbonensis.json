    "intro": "Mentha ratisbonensis, commonly known as peppermint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, serrated leaves that are typically a deep green. The plant produces small, pale purple flowers in whorled clusters, which are borne on slender spikes. Peppermint is known for its strong, aromatic scent and contains high concentrations of menthol, which contributes to its cooling effect. It is widely cultivated for use in teas, aromatherapy, and as a flavoring agent in various products."
