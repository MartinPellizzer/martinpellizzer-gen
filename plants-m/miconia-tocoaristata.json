    "intro": "Miconia tocoaristata, commonly known as the pink miconia, is a tropical shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often bright green with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a distinctive red, fleshy berry that contains numerous small seeds. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in some regions, though it can become invasive if not managed properly."
