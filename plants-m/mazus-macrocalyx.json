    "intro": "Mazus macrocalyx, commonly known as the large-flowered mazus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to eastern Asia. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shady areas. Due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation, it is popular among gardeners interested in native plants."
