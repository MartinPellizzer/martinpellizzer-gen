It belongs to the Podocarpaceae family and is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dense, evergreen foliage. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 30 meters in its natural habitat. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and is used in traditional construction and crafts. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a threatened species."
