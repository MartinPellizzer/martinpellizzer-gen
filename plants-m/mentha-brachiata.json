It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom during the summer months. Mentha brachiata is known for its aromatic, menthol-like scent and is often used in traditional Chinese medicine. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is a member of the Lamiaceae family."
