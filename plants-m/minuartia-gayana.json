    "intro": "Minuartia gayana, commonly known as the sandstone saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky environments in southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial with small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found on sandstone outcrops. Due to its delicate nature, it is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and over-collection."
