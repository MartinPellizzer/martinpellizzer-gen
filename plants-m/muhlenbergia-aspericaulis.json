It features slender, upright stems with hairy, rough-textured leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces panicles of small, fluffy flowers in late summer, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Muhlenbergia aspericaulis is often used in native plant gardens for its ecological benefits and low maintenance requirements."
