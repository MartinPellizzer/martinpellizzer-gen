    "intro": "Melicope frutescens, commonly known as the Hawaiian melicope, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, including Hawaii, Madagascar, and parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its aromatic, often fragrant leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal or lowland forest areas, thriving in humid, warm climates with well-drained soil. Its fruit is a small, round drupe that turns from green to red or orange as it matures, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for various bird and insect species."
