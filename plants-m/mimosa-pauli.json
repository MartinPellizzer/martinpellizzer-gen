    "intro": "Mimosa pauli, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a deciduous shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardens and containers. Despite its delicate appearance, Mimosa pauli is relatively low maintenance and resistant to most pests and diseases."
