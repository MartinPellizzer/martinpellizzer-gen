    "intro": "Mollia lepidota f. acrocarpa, commonly known as the acrocarpous form of the moss, is a variant of the species characterized by its acrocarpous growth habit, where the sporophytes develop at the apex of the gametophyte. It is a small, leafy moss that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The leaves are usually ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Its spore capsules are terminal, and the plant exhibits a simple yet distinct morphology typical of many mosses. This form is of interest in botanical studies due to its morphological variation and ecological adaptability."
