    "intro": "Mystacinus mystacinus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its delicate, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. It has long, slender roots that anchor it to tree bark and absorb moisture from the air. Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
