It features elliptical, glossy leaves with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that are typically red or pink in color, which bloom throughout the year in some regions. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds. Melastoma cinchonifolium is often found in moist, shaded forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
