    "intro": "Myosurus minimus subsp. pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's lesser mouse-ear, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant features tiny, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, white flowers in the spring. It is a member of the Primulaceae family, which includes other flowering plants with similar morphological traits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
