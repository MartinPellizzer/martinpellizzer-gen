It features small, alternate, ovate leaves with a slightly toothed margin and produces tiny, white, four-petaled flowers. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to thrive in wet environments, often found near streams and damp meadows. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is closely related to other species of the genus Montia. Its botanical significance lies in its ecological role and potential medicinal properties."
