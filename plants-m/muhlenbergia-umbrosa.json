    "intro": "Muhlenbergia umbrosa, commonly known as the shade muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in woodland and shaded environments, preferring moist, well-drained soils. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often a deep green. Its inflorescence consists of loosely arranged spikelets that produce small, pale blue to purple flowers. Muhlenbergia umbrosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, low-growing mats in shaded garden settings."
