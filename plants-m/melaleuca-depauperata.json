    "intro": "Melaleuca depauperata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels off in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bottlebrush-like flowers in shades of yellow to red, which are typically borne in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a leathery texture and a bluish-green hue. Melaleuca depauperata is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in coastal and inland regions, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
