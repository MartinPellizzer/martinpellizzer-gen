    "intro": "Marrubium aquaticum, commonly known as water horehound, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to thrive in moist, aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions. Marrubium aquaticum is often found in marshes, stream banks, and other waterlogged habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
