    "intro": "Mucuna birdwoodiana, commonly known as the birdwood morning glory, is a vigorous climbing vine native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet. The plant produces distinctive, flat, bean-like pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its rapid growth and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a garden plant."
