    "intro": "Monium, commonly known as the \"liverworts,\" is a group of non-vascular plants that belong to the division Marchantiophyta. These plants typically grow in moist, shaded environments and are characterized by their simple structure and lack of true roots, stems, and leaves. Monium species often have a thalloid body, which is a flat, leaf-like structure that absorbs water and nutrients directly from the environment. They play an important role in ecological systems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitats for microorganisms. Due to their ancient lineage, they offer valuable insights into the early evolution of land plants."
