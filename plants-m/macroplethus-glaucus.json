    "intro": "Macroplethus glaucus, commonly known as the blue spurge, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
