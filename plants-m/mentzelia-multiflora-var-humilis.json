    "intro": "Mentzelia multiflora var. humilis, commonly known as the plains blazingstar, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in open, dry habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
