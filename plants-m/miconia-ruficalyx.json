    "intro": "Miconia ruficalyx, commonly known as the red-veined miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with prominent reddish veins, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
