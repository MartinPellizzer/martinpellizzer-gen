    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum stelligerum, commonly known as the coastal dune mesem, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a succulent shrub that thrives in arid and coastal environments, often found on sandy soils. The plant features fleshy, ribbed stems and leaves that are typically covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered, often with a yellow or orange hue, and bloom in the morning. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion."
