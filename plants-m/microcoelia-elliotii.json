    "intro": "Microcoelia elliotii, commonly known as Elliot's microcoelia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky soils, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Microcoelia elliotii is considered a species of conservation concern."
