    "intro": "Metrodorea mollis var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth false nettle, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Urticaceae family, which includes stinging nettles, and is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and opposite leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in clustered inflorescences. The species is often confused with other similar-looking plants due to its lack of stinging hairs, making it a notable species in ecological studies."
