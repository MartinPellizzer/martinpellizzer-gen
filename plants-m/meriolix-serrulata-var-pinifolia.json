    "intro": "Meriolix serrulata var. pinifolia, commonly known as the needleleaf meriolix, is a rare and specialized plant species characterized by its unique leaf morphology. It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy cuticle, an adaptation to its typically arid or high-altitude habitat. The plant belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs, though it is less commonly cultivated for its fragrance. Its small, clustered flowers are usually white or pale yellow, contributing to its ornamental value in certain horticultural contexts. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a botanically interesting but ecologically fragile species."
