    "intro": "Meliosma simplicifolia subsp. yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan meliosma, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China, where it thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Its small, pale yellow flowers are clustered in inflorescences and bloom in late spring to early summer. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution."
