It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds.

Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in tropical ecosystems."
