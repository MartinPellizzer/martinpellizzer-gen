    "intro": "Montia saxosa, commonly known as the alpine bladderwort, is a small flowering plant native to mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, a feature adapted to its harsh, arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers with four petals, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in rocky soils and high elevations, often found in alpine tundra and scree slopes. Due to its specialized habitat, Montia saxosa is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of ecological health in mountain ecosystems."
