    "intro": "Microloma glabratum, commonly known as the smooth microloma, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and is adapted to dry, sandy soils. It produces pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in its native habitat. Microloma glabratum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
