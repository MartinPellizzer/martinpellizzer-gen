    "intro": "Misodendrum planifolium, commonly known as the flat-leafed mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on various host trees. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in a flat, spreading pattern. The plant produces small white or yellowish flowers, followed by berries that are often consumed by birds. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is adapted to thrive in humid, tropical environments. Its botanical structure reflects its parasitic lifestyle, with reduced roots and specialized structures for nutrient absorption from its host."
