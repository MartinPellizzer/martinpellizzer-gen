    "intro": "Mokof oleifolia, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and rough, fissured bark that becomes more prominent with age. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions. Mokof oleifolia is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used for construction and tool-making."
