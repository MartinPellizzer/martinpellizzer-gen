    "intro": "Merremia bracteata, commonly known as the velvetleaf morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, black seeds. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some areas."
