    "intro": "Maxillaria caulina, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, often with a distinctive lip that is marked with purple or brown patterns. Maxillaria caulina is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks rather than in soil. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for rock gardens and specialized orchid collections."
