    "intro": "Matelea cynanchoides, commonly known as the Mexican moonflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes milkweeds and related species. The plant is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a hairy texture. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release its seeds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in arid environments."
