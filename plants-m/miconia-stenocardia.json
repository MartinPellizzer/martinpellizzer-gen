    "intro": "Miconia stenocardia, commonly known as the broadleaf miconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers, which are followed by distinctive, red, fleshy fruits. Miconia stenocardia is often found in humid, lowland forests and thrives in warm, moist environments. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, it can become invasive in certain regions."
