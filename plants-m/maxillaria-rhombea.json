It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically blooms during the summer months, with flowers that have a distinctive rhombus-shaped lip. Its pseudobulbs are relatively short, and the leaves are narrow and grass-like. Maxillaria rhombea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
