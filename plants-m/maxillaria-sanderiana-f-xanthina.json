    "intro": "Maxillaria sanderiana f. xanthina, commonly known as the Yellow Maxillaria, is a hybrid orchid species native to South America. It is characterized by its striking yellow and green floral coloration, which sets it apart from the typical green and white blooms of the parent species. The plant features elongated, narrow pseudobulbs and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This cultivar is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
