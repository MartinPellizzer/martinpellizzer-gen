    "intro": "Macrozanonia, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a large aquatic plant native to South America. It features broad, floating leaves that can reach up to three meters in diameter, providing shade over water bodies. The plant has showy, fragrant flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like bats and moths. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in shallow waters while absorbing nutrients from the surrounding environment. Macrozanonia plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by offering habitat and shelter for various aquatic life forms."
