    "intro": "Marathrum minutiflorum f. allenii, commonly known as the Allen's dwarf marathrum, is a rare and compact cultivar of the marathrum genus. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and dense, foliage that gives it a bushy appearance. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its botanical features make it a desirable addition to rock gardens and alpine collections.
