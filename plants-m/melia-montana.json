    "intro": "Melia montana, commonly known as the mountain ash or white ash, is a deciduous tree native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and pinnately arranged, and its small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The tree produces small, round fruits that are encased in a persistent, woody husk. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often peeling in thin layers. Melia montana is valued for its hard, durable wood and is also used in traditional medicine for its various therapeutic properties."
