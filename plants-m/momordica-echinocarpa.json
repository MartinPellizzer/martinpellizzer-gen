    "intro": "Momordica echinocarpa, commonly known as the horned melon, is a tropical vine native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive spiky, green, gourd-like fruit that turns orange when ripe. The plant produces small, white flowers and has heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The fruit is edible, though its thick, waxy rind can be tough to remove. It is often cultivated for its unique flavor and ornamental value."
