    "intro": "Maytenus heterophylla subsp. puberula, commonly known as the hairy mayten, is a shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and often hairy leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, woody fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in dry forests and scrublands. The subspecies is distinguished by its pubescent (hairy) foliage, which gives it its common name."
