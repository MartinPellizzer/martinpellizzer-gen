    "intro": "Mentha tomentosa var. viridula, commonly known as the woolly mint or green-haired mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fuzzy, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers arranged in whorled clusters, which bloom in late summer. Mentha tomentosa var. viridula is often found in rocky or alpine habitats where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is valued in traditional herbal medicine for its purported cooling and digestive properties."
