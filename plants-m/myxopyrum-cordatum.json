It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette, with a distinctive heart-shaped base on some of the lower leaves. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Myxopyrum cordatum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora."
