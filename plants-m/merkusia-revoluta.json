    "intro": "Merkusia revoluta, commonly known as the revolute merkusia, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stem and pinnately compound leaves that are often revolute, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by coconut-like fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and ample sunlight. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
