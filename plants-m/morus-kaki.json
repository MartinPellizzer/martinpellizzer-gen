    "intro": "Morus kaki, commonly known as the Japanese or Chinese white mulberry, is a deciduous tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pinkish flowers that appear in spring. The tree produces small, fuzzy fruits called mulberries, which are edible and have a sweet, juicy flavor. Morus kaki is widely cultivated for its fruit and has been used in traditional medicine for centuries. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a valuable plant in both horticulture and ecological restoration."
