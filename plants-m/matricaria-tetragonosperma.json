    "intro": "Matricaria tetragonosperma, commonly known as the four-angled hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows, and it is known for its hairy, four-angled stems. Its small yellow flowers bloom in the summer, and the plant produces small, spherical seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Matricaria tetragonosperma is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize various environments."
