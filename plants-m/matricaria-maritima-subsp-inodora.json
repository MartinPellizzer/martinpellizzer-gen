    "intro": "Matricaria maritima subsp. inodora, commonly known as the coastal everlasting or sea dandelion, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and gray-green, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. It is drought-tolerant and has a long flowering period, typically from late spring to early autumn. Its subsp. inodora variant is distinguished by its lack of a strong scent, unlike the more commonly known Matricaria chamomilla."
