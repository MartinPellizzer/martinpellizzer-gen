    "intro": "Malaxis chevalieri, commonly known as the Chevalier's Malaxis, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant has a short, erect stem with a single or few leaves, and its flowers are usually greenish-white with prominent purple or brown markings. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
