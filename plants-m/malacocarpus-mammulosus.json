    "intro": "Malacocarpus mammulosus, commonly known as the woolly pod plant, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its distinctive, hairy, pod-like fruits that give it its common name. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are bipinnate, and the flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, arranged in racemes. The woody pods contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals, contributing to its ecological role in its native habitat."
