    "intro": "Medicago tribuloides var. subinermis, commonly known as narrowleaf sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, often hairy stems and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval to lance-shaped leaflets. It is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Narrowleaf sainfoin is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and historical use as forage for livestock."
