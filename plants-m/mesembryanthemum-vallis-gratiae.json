It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its compact growth habit and vibrant blooms make it an attractive addition to Mediterranean-style landscapes."
