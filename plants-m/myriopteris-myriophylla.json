    "intro": "Myriopteris myriophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf huperzia, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of its leaves, a feature common among ferns. Myriopteris myriophylla is known for its slow growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
