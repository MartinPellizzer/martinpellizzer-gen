    "intro": "Meibomia psilophylla var. wrightii, commonly known as Wright's meibomia, is a rare and delicate fern native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its slender, arching fronds with finely divided, lance-shaped pinnae. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often near streams or in the understorey of tropical rainforests. Its small, spore-producing sorus is located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
