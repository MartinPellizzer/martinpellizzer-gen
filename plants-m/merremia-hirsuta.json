    "intro": "Merremia hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves, which are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, blooming in the early morning. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release seeds. Merremia hirsuta is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
