    "intro": "Metalasia caespitosa, commonly known as the tufted grass or coastal grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It forms dense, tufted clumps with slender, wiry stems that often grow close to the ground. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish or brownish and appear in clusters at the base of the plant. Metalasia caespitosa is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a common sight in coastal dune environments."
