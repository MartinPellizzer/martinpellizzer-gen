    "intro": "Mallotus lackeyi, commonly known as the African wild almond, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
