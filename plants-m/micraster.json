    "intro": "Micraster, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny leaves and showy, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to coastal areas of the northern hemisphere, Micraster thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value. Its flowers attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
