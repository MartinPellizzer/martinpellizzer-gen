    "intro": "Myrica elliptica, commonly known as the wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, elliptical leaves that are often coated with a waxy cuticle, giving the plant its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by dark blue, waxy berries. Myrica elliptica thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands and along streambanks. It has aromatic foliage and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
