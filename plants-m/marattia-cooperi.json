    "intro": "Marattia cooperi, commonly known as the Cooper's marattia, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Marattiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant exhibits a unique growth habit, with its rhizomes forming a dense underground network that supports its structure. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in rich, organic soil found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
