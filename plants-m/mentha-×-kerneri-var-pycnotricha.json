    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 kerneri var. pycnotricha, commonly known as the woolly mint, is a hybrid perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and aromatic, slightly menthol-like scent. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often glandular and covered in fine pubescence. Its flowering stems bear whorled clusters of small, pale blue to violet flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in well-drained, sunny conditions."
