    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 aquaticoarvensis f. eifliensis, commonly known as the Eifel water mint, is a hybrid plant that exhibits characteristics of both Mentha aquatica and Mentha arvensis. It is a perennial herb with a creeping rhizome system, allowing it to spread across wetland and marshy areas. The plant produces opposite, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it bears small, pale blue to purple flowers arranged in whorls. It thrives in moist to waterlogged soils and is often found in temperate regions of Europe. Due to its hybrid nature, it shows variability in morphology and is sometimes challenging to classify botanically."
