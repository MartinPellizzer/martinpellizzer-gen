    "intro": "Mammillaria spinosissima f. typica, commonly known as the spiny mammillaria, is a compact cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular stem covered in prominent, sharp spines that are typically white or yellowish in color. The plant produces small, white flowers during the spring and summer months. Its growth is slow, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections. The f. typica form is distinguished by its more robust spines compared to other forms of the species."
