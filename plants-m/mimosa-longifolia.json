    "intro": "Mimosa longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf mimosa, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait known as thigmonasty. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil in its native habitat. Mimosa longifolia is often found in sandy soils along the coastlines and in open woodlands."
