    "intro": "Miconia macrodon, commonly known as the giant miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces showy, white to pale yellow flowers with prominent, fleshy petals. Its fruit is a bright red, fleshy berry that contains numerous small seeds. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
