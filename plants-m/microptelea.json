It consists of a single species, Microptelea neriifolia, which is native to eastern Asia, particularly China and Japan. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate or elliptic in shape.

The tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes."
