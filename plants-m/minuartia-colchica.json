    "intro": "Minuartia colchica, commonly known as the Caucasian rockcress, is a low-growing flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers and linear, fleshy leaves. The plant thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often growing on slopes and cliffs where it can access adequate sunlight. Its compact growth habit and ability to tolerate harsh conditions make it well adapted to its native habitat. Minuartia colchica is typically found in areas with well-drained soil and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental appeal."
