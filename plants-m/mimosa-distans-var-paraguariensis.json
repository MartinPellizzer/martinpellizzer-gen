    "intro": "Mimosa distans var. paraguariensis, commonly known as the Paraguayan mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a phenomenon known as nyctinasty. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by legume pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its unique properties, it has been used traditionally in folk medicine and for its ornamental value."
