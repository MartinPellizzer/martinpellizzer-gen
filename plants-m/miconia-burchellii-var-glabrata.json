    "intro": "Miconia burchellii var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth-leaved miconia, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain ecosystems."
