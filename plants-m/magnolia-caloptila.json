    "intro": "Magnolia caloptila, commonly known as the narrow-leaved magnolia, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top. The tree produces large, showy flowers that are usually white or pale pink, with a subtle fragrance. These flowers appear in early spring before the leaves emerge, adding to its ornamental value. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and the tree can grow up to 20 meters tall in its natural habitat."
