    "intro": "Monadenium echinulatum, commonly known as the spiny globemallow, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense covering of spiny bracts. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the dry season. Its leaves are small, hairy, and adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Monadenium echinulatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in drought-tolerant gardens."
