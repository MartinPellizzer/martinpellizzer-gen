    "intro": "Mesopteris pseudostenobasis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and play a key role in its reproductive cycle."
