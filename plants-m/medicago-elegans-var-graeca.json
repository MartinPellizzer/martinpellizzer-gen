    "intro": "Medicago elegans var. graeca, commonly known as Greek clover, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it a common sight in dry, open habitats. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
