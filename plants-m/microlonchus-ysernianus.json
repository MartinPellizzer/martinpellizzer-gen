It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clusters of pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
