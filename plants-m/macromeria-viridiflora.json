    "intro": "Macromeria viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered macromeria, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are notable for their bright green petals, which contrast with the yellow-orange centers, making it a visually striking species. Macromeria viridiflora is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along stream banks."
