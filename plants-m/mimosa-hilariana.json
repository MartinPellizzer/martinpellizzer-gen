The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in response to touch or light. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its sensitivity to environmental changes, it is sometimes used as an indicator plant for soil health."
