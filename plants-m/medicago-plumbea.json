    "intro": "Medicago plumbea, commonly known as the pale medic, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with silvery-white markings and small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, elongated pods containing several seeds, and it thrives in well-drained soils. It is often found in disturbed areas, roadsides, and dry grasslands. Medicago plumbea is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
