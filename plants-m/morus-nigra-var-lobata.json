    "intro": "Morus nigra var. lobata, commonly known as the black mulberry with lobed leaves, is a variant of the black mulberry tree native to the Middle East and South Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive lobed leaves, which give it a unique appearance compared to the standard black mulberry. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are edible and often used in traditional foods and beverages. It thrives in temperate climates and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. The tree is also valued for its ornamental qualities and historical significance in horticulture."
