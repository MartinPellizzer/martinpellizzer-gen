    "intro": "Melaleuca pallescens, commonly known as the white honey myrtle, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish powdery coating. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically pink or pale red, which bloom in spring. Its bark is smooth and ranges in color from grey to white, and it is often found in sandy or coastal soils. Melaleuca pallescens is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in horticulture for its hardy nature and attractive appearance."
