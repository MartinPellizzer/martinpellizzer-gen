It is characterized by its daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, and its aromatic, slightly bitter leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and prefers well-drained soil in full sun. It blooms from late spring to early autumn, producing small, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators. Matricaria tenella is often used in herbal teas and traditional medicine for its calming and anti-inflammatory properties."
