    "intro": "Mononeuria glabra, commonly known as the smooth bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its simple, unbranched stems and small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used for capturing prey. The plant is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are reduced to scale-like structures, and it lacks true roots, relying instead on its bladders for nutrient absorption. Mononeuria glabra is a carnivorous plant that plays a unique role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling through its predation on small invertebrates."
