    "intro": "Melaleuca torulosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous inner layer, and its narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, which attract nectar-feeding insects and birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and heathlands. Melaleuca torulosa is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soils in degraded environments."
