    "intro": "Menonvillea flexuosa f. tomentosa, commonly known as the velvety menonvillea, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are covered in a dense, woolly pubescence. The plant produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored bracts that attract pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
