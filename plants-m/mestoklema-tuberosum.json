It features a thick, tuberous root system that stores nutrients and water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a waxy coating, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. Its tubers are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The botanical characteristics of Mestoklema tuberosum make it well adapted to its native environment and useful in both culinary and medicinal contexts."
