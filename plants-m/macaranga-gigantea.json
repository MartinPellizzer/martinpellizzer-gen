    "intro": "Macaranga gigantea, commonly known as the giant macaranga, is a fast-growing tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody, three-lobed capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas, it plays a significant role in ecological succession."
