    "intro": "Melilotus leiospermus, commonly known as silky melilot, is a perennial legume native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round pods containing several seeds, and it has finely hairy foliage that gives it a silky appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Silky melilot is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
