    "intro": "Myrteola humifusa, commonly known as the ground myrtle, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands and coastal areas of eastern Australia. It is a low-growing shrub with small, aromatic leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its botanical features include a woody stem, opposite leaf arrangement, and a preference for moist, well-drained soils. Myrteola humifusa is often found in swampy or brackish environments, contributing to the ecological diversity of these habitats."
