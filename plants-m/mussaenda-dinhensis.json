    "intro": "Mussaenda dinhensis, commonly known as the Dinh's Mussaenda, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its showy, clustered inflorescences that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure. Mussaenda dinhensis is appreciated for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
