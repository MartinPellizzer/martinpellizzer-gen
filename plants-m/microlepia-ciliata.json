    "intro": "Microlepia ciliata, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a slender, arching appearance. The sori, which are clusters of sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
