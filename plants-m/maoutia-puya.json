    "intro": "Maoutia puya, commonly known as the Andean giant hogweed, is a striking plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its large, umbrella-like inflorescence. The plant can grow up to 4 meters tall, with thick, fleshy stems and large, pinnately compound leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds. Due to its size and appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
