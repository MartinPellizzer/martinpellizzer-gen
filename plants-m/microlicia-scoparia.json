    "intro": "Microlicia scoparia, commonly known as the desert thornbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round fruits containing seeds. It is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can withstand prolonged periods of drought. Microlicia scoparia plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing shelter for small animals in its native habitat."
