    "intro": "Miersiella costata, commonly known as the ribbed liverwort, is a species of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive ribbed or corrugated thallus, which gives it its scientific name. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. It has a simple structure with no true roots, stems, or leaves, and relies on spores for reproduction. Miersiella costata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem."
