    "intro": "Mercurialis ovata, commonly known as the smooth mercury plant, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a herbaceous annual that grows up to 1 meter tall, characterized by its slender, branching stems and alternate leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, three-lobed capsule that splits open when mature to release the seeds. The species is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, showing adaptability to various environmental conditions."
