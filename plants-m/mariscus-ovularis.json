    "intro": "Mariscus ovularis, commonly known as the oval leaf mariscus, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches a height of about 30 centimeters. The plant features small, ovular leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Its flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences and are usually pale green to yellow in color. Mariscus ovularis is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a resilient species in rocky or coastal habitats."
