    "intro": "Minuartia mesogitana subsp. flaccida, commonly known as the flaccid rock-cress, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to rocky and arid environments in the Mediterranean region. It features small, fleshy, orbicular leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, with four petals arranged in a cross shape, typical of the Brassicaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found on limestone or sandstone substrates. This subspecies is adapted to harsh, sunny conditions and is considered a characteristic plant of Mediterranean scrublands."
