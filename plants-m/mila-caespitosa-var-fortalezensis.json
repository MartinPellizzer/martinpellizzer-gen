It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, silver-gray foliage that reflects sunlight effectively. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, moist environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in native plant gardens."
