    "intro": "Menodora gypsophila, commonly known as the gypsum nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub or subshrub with woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white or grayish pubescence. The plant produces violet to purple flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It thrives in well-drained soils, often found on limestone or gypsum outcrops, and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Menodora gypsophila plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying xerophytic plants."
