    "intro": "Myroxylon, commonly known as Copaiba, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Burseraceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. The plant is characterized by its aromatic resin, which is harvested from the bark and used in traditional medicine and perfumery. Myroxylon trees can grow up to 30 meters tall, featuring smooth, grayish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The genus includes several species, with Myroxylon balsamum and Myroxylon insulare being the most commercially significant."
