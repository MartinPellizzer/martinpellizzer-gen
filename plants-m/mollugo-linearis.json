    "intro": "Mollugo linearis, commonly known as sandpennywort, is a low-growing, annual plant native to sandy and disturbed soils in temperate regions. It features small, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a common weed in gardens and along roadsides. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Mollugo linearis is often used in ecological studies due to its resilience and adaptability to various environmental conditions."
