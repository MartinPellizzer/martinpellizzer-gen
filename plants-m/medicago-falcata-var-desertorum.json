    "intro": "Medicago falcata var. desertorum, commonly known as the desert burclover, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces bur-like seed pods that contain numerous small, dark seeds. It is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained soils and requiring minimal water. This species plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife and livestock in desert ecosystems."
