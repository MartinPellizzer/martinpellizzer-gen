    "intro": "Micranthus, commonly known as the small-flowered grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae. These plants are typically found in temperate regions and are characterized by their compact growth habit and small, delicate flowers. Micranthus species often thrive in moist, well-drained soils and are sometimes used in ornamental gardening. They produce grass-like leaves and have inflorescences that can be either spike-like or panicle-shaped. Due to their resilience and adaptability, some species of Micranthus are also used in ecological restoration projects."
