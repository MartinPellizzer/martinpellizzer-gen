    "intro": "Mimosa azuensis, commonly known as the Azuensian sensitive plant, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold when touched, a trait known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in hairy pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Mimosa azuensis is often found in moist, sunny habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role."
