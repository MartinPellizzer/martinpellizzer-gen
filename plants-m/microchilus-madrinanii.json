    "intro": "Microchilus madrinanii, commonly known as the Madrilenian microchilus, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, limestone-rich soils in open habitats such as scrublands and forest edges. It features small, greenish-yellow flowers and is often found in regions with a Mediterranean climate. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
