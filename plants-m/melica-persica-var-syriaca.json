It features slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or semi-arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
