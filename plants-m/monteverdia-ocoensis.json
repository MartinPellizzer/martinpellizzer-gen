    "intro": "Monteverdia ocoensis, commonly known as the Ocoa monteverdia, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and climbing growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests, where it plays a role in supporting local biodiversity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
