    "intro": "Miconia scabra, commonly known as rough miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of stinging hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia scabra is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain regions."
