    "intro": "Miconia decorticans, commonly known as the \"Brazil nut tree,\" is a tropical plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It is a large evergreen tree that can grow up to 40 meters tall, characterized by its broad, palmate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody pods containing seeds surrounded by a hard, resinous coat. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility. The tree plays a vital ecological role in the rainforest, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
