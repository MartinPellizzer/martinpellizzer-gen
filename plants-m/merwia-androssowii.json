It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which is known for its diverse and often toxic species. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cyathia, a unique structure typical of the family. It typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, showing adaptations to withstand drought conditions. Due to its ornamental potential and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though caution is advised due to its potential irritant properties."
