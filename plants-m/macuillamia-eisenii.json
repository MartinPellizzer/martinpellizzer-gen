    "intro": "Macuillamia eisenii, commonly known as the Eisen's macuillamia, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, thriving in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
