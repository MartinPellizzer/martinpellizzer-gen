    "intro": "Mimosa nobilis, commonly known as the silky mimosa, is a deciduous shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by light or touch. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers in spring, which are followed by fluffy, white seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often considered a weed in non-native habitats."
