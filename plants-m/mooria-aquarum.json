    "intro": "Mooria aquarum, commonly known as the aquatic moor grass, is a species of flowering plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, clustered inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, adapting to aquatic conditions with its rhizomatous growth habit. Its leaves are narrow and cylindrical, often floating or submerged depending on the water depth. Mooria aquarum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
