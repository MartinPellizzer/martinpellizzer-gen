    "intro": "Medicago sativa var. atriflora, commonly known as black medic, is a flowering plant in the legume family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, dark purple to black flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is native to Europe and western Asia but has been introduced to many other regions. Black medic is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of soil types. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
