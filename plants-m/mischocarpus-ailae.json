    "intro": "Mischocarpus ailae, commonly known as the Andean chestnut, is a member of the Sapotaceae family and is native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into woody, spiny fruits containing one or two seeds. Its seeds are encased in a hard, inedible shell, and the tree is valued for its ecological role in its native habitat."
