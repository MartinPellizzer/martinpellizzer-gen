    "intro": "Medicago laciniata var. brevidenticulata, commonly known as the narrow-toothed clover, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features trifoliate leaves with narrow, serrated lobes and produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or white. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities. Its botanical structure supports its role in soil enrichment and as a forage plant for livestock."
