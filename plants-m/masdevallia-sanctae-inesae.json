    "intro": "Masdevallia sanctae-inesae, commonly known as the Santa In\u00e9s orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the Andes of Ecuador. It is characterized by its intricate, often colorful inflorescences and delicate, strap-like leaves. The plant thrives in high-altitude cloud forests, where it attaches itself to tree trunks or branches. Its flowers typically bloom in late winter or early spring, showcasing a range of hues including red, orange, and yellow. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
