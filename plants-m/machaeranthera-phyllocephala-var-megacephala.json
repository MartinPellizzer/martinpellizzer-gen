It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a grayish-blue hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The variety megacephala is distinguished by its notably large, rounded flower heads compared to other varieties of Machaeranthera."
