    "intro": "Miconia amazonica, commonly known as the Amazonian miconia, is a tropical tree native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 50 cm in diameter. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It is often found in the understory of humid lowland forests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain regions."
