    "intro": "Monvillea apoloensis, commonly known as the Apoloensis monvillea, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Cameroon. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has a compact growth habit with fleshy, dark green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
