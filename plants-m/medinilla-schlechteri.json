    "intro": "Medinilla schlechteri, commonly known as the velvet tangerine. This evergreen shrub is native to the Philippines and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruits are small, round, and resemble tangerines, hence its common name. Medinilla schlechteri is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of care."
