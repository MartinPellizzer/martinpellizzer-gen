    "intro": "Malaxis juliani, commonly known as the Julian's lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a dense, spiraled inflorescence of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by flies and beetles due to their lack of showy color. Malaxis juliani is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
