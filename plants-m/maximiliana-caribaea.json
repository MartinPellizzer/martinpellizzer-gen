    "intro": "Maximiliana caribaea, commonly known as the Caribbean mahogany, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, ovate leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, woody fruits containing several seeds. Its heartwood is highly valued for its durability and rich, reddish-brown color. Due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species in many regions."
