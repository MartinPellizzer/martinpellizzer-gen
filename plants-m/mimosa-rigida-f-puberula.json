    "intro": "Mimosa rigida f. puberula, commonly known as the woolly mimosa, is a variant of the rigid mimosa, characterized by its dense, soft pubescence covering its stems and leaves. This plant is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of multiple pairs of small, feather-like leaflets. The flowers are typically yellow and appear in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soil."
