    "intro": "Melochia diffusa, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Native to Africa, it has been introduced to various parts of the world and is often considered an invasive species. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils make it a significant ecological concern in some regions."
