    "intro": "Miconia biserrata, commonly known as the serrated miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often attracting pollinators like bees and birds. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature. Miconia biserrata is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it a potential invasive species in certain regions."
