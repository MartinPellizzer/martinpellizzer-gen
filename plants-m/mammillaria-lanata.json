    "intro": "Mammillaria lanata, commonly known as the woolly mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in dense, white, woolly hairs. The plant produces pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, typically from a single central bud. Its succulent leaves are modified into spines, and it thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for indoor and rock garden cultivation."
