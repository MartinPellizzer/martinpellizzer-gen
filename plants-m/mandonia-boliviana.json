    "intro": "Mandonia boliviana, commonly known as the Bolivian mandonia, is a flowering plant native to the Andes region of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, where it thrives in cool and dry conditions. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, and it produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Mandonia boliviana is considered a rare and endemic species."
