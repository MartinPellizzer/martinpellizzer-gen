    "intro": "Mikania buddlejifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a vine that typically grows up to 3 meters in length, featuring heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, such as along roadsides and in forest edges. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative means make it an invasive species in some regions."
