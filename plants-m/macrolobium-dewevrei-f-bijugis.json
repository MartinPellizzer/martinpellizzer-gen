    "intro": "Macrolobium dewevrei f. bijugis, commonly known as the Bijugis macrolobium, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical regions of Central Africa. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that are often fragrant and attract various pollinators. Its unique foliage and ornamental value make it a sought-after specimen in botanical gardens and private collections. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
