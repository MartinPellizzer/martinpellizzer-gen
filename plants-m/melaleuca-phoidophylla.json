    "intro": "Melaleuca phoidophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to northern Australia, particularly Queensland and the Northern Territory, where it thrives in wet tropical environments. The plant is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous inner layer, and its small, fragrant white or pink flowers that appear in clusters. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating, and it produces small, woody fruits. This species is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil conditions."
