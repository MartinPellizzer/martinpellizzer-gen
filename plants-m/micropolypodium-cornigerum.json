    "intro": "Micropolypodium cornigerum, commonly known as the corn-crested polypody, is a small epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks. The plant has delicate, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Micropolypodium cornigerum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of care in the right conditions."
