It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and pinnately compound leaves with small, oval leaflets. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. This variety is often cultivated for forage and has ornamental value in gardens."
