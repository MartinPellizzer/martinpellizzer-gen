    "intro": "Mimosa mangensis, commonly known as the mangrove mimosa, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in brackish or saline environments, often found in mangrove forests and tidal wetlands. Its root system helps stabilize coastal soils and prevent erosion. Mimosa mangensis plays an important ecological role in supporting diverse marine and terrestrial life in its habitat."
