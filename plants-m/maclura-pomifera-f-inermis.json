    "intro": "Maclura pomifera f. inermis, commonly known as the smooth-fruited honeylocust, is a cultivated form of the honeylocust tree native to North America. It is characterized by its smooth, thornless stems and distinctive, compound leaves that are bipinnately divided. The plant produces large, yellow, fleshy fruits that are edible but have a strong, sweet aroma. It is often grown as an ornamental tree due to its attractive foliage and manageable size. This variety is adapted to a range of soil types and is relatively drought-tolerant."
