    "intro": "Microsorum scandens, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically thrives in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, allowing it to form dense mats that help stabilize the ecosystem. Microsorum scandens is often used in aquascaping due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide shelter for aquatic life."
