    "intro": "Myristica hypargyraea subsp. insularis, commonly known as the island myristica, is a member of the Myristicaceae family and is native to certain tropical regions. It is a small evergreen tree or shrub characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant flowers. The plant produces distinctive red berries that contain a single seed, which is often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
