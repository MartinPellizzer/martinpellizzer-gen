    "intro": "Medicago \u00d7 polychroa var. glomerata, commonly known as the yellow sweet clover, is a hybrid perennial legume characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers. It is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia and is often found in disturbed soils, fields, and along roadsides. The plant is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. It produces small, round seed pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. Due to its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing capabilities, it is sometimes used in agricultural settings for soil enrichment."
