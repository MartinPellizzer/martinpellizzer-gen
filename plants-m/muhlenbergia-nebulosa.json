    "intro": "Muhlenbergia nebulosa, commonly known as the cloudgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive, almost ethereal appearance. The plant produces fluffy, pinkish-white seed heads that are visually striking and attract pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Muhlenbergia nebulosa is also valued for its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
