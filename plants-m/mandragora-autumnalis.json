    "intro": "Mandragora autumnalis, commonly known as the autumn mandrake, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its distinctive, often lobed leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces small, spherical berries that contain toxic alkaloids, making it both dangerous and valuable in traditional medicine. Its historical significance in folklore and herbalism is closely tied to its appearance and potent chemical composition."
