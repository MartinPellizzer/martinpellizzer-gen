It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically blooms in spring and summer, producing bright yellow or orange flowers that attract pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid conditions."
