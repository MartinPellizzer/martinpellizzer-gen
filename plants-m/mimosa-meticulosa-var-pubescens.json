    "intro": "Mimosa meticulosa var. pubescens, commonly known as the silky mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its finely hairy, silvery-gray foliage that gives it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, yellow, ball-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into multiple pairs of leaflets, which are sensitive to touch and fold shut when disturbed. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to tropical and subtropical climates."
