    "intro": "Muraltia salsolacea, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and southern Europe. It is a low-growing shrub with small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a dry capsule containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Muraltia salsolacea is often used in traditional medicine and has potential applications in phytoremediation due to its ability to tolerate heavy metals."
