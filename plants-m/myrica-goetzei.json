    "intro": "Myrica goetzei, commonly known as the sweet fern, is a shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its feathery, fern-like leaves that are dark green and emit a pleasant, aromatic scent when crushed. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into dark blue berries, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Myrica goetzei thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. It plays a significant role in ecological systems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
