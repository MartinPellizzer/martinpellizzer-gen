    "intro": "Medinilla plumosa, commonly known as the velvet tangerine, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant has elliptical, glossy leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Medinilla plumosa is popular as a ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and continuous blooming habit."
