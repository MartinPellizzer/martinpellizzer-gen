    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum vespertinum, commonly known as the evening daisy, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that open in the late afternoon and close at dawn, a characteristic behavior known as nyctinasty. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and adaptive traits make it both ornamental and ecologically significant in its native habitat."
