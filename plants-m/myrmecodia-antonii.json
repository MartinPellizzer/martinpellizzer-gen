    "intro": "Myrmecodia antonii, commonly known as the ant-plant, is a unique tropical shrub belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its swollen, tree-like stems that serve as a habitat for ants, which in turn protect the plant from herbivores. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers, followed by small, red berries that are edible for some bird species. Myrmecodia antonii is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its symbiotic relationship with ants is a key feature of its ecological role in its native habitat."
