    "intro": "Malaxis correana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant has slender, often hairy stems and produces small, greenish or brownish flowers that are clustered in racemes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Malaxis correana is a relatively rare and delicate species, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
