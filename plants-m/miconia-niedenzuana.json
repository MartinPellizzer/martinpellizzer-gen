    "intro": "Miconia niedenzuana, commonly known as the \"sacred tree\" in some indigenous communities, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter, often with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
