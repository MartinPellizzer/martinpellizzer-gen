    "intro": "Megarrhena, commonly known as the sand wasp, is a genus of solitary wasps found primarily in arid and semi-arid regions. These plants, though not actually plants, are often mistaken for such due to their unique, spiky, and sometimes thorn-like structures. The \"flowers\" of Megarrhena are actually modified stems or bracts that serve as protective structures for their larvae. They are typically found in sandy soils and are often associated with specific host plants. The genus is notable for its ecological role in controlling pest populations through parasitism."
