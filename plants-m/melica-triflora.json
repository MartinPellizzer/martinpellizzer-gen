    "intro": "Melica triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. The plant is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet with three flowers, which is a distinguishing feature. Melica triflora is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
