    "intro": "Morus alba var. tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mulberry, is a variant of the white mulberry native to China. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically smaller than those of the standard white mulberry. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits called syconia, which are often consumed by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its fibrous bark and ornamental value. This variety is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
