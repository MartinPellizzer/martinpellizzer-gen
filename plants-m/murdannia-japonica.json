    "intro": "Murdannia japonica, commonly known as Japanese burrgrass, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It is a low-growing herb with small, hairy leaves and produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers. The plant is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks. Its seeds are encased in hard, spiky structures that aid in dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. Murdannia japonica is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
