    "intro": "Myosotis alpestris subsp. albomarginata, commonly known as the white-margin bluebell, is a flowering plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its delicate, blue to purple flowers with white margins, which distinguish it from other species in the genus. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in mountainous areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and hairy, adapted to withstand cold and harsh environmental conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
