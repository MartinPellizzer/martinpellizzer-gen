    "intro": "Mastigostyla cardenasii, commonly known as the Cretaceous fern, is a fossilized plant that provides valuable insights into ancient ecosystems. It belongs to the order Marattiopsida and is characterized by its complex, frond-like structures. The plant's morphology suggests it thrived in warm, humid environments during the Cretaceous period. Its spores are often found in sedimentary rock layers, indicating its widespread distribution. This fossilized plant helps scientists understand the evolution of ferns and their ecological roles in prehistoric times."
