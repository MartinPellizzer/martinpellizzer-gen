It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves with prominent stipules. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer seasons. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft, velvety texture. Mahernia grandistipula is valued in traditional medicine for its potential medicinal properties."
