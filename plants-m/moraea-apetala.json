It belongs to the Iridaceae family, which includes many ornamental plants such as irises and crocuses. The plant is characterized by its lack of showy flowers, instead producing small, inconspicuous blooms. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it often grows in rocky or sandy soils. Moraea apetala is valued for its resilience and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental foliage."
