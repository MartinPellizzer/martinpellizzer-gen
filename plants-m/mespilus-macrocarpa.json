    "intro": "Mespilus macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces edible, subacid berries that ripen in the autumn, though they are typically harvested when partially decayed. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, contributing to its ornamental value. Mespilus macrocarpa is often grown for its unique fruit and historical use in traditional medicine."
