It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other mustard family plants. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Its flowers are small and white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, round seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
