    "intro": "Mitrasacme pilosa var. stuartii, commonly known as the Stuart's hairy mitrasacme, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its densely hairy foliage and unique floral structure, which consists of small, clustered flowers with prominent stamens. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it thrives on nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a rough texture due to the presence of fine, stiff hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
