    "intro": "Microsorum subgeminatum, commonly known as the twin-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often appear in pairs, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its floating leaves provide habitat for small aquatic organisms. Microsorum subgeminatum is valued in aquatic gardening for its ornamental appeal and ease of care."
