    "intro": "Mandragora shebbearei, commonly known as the Ethiopian mandrake, is a perennial herb native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its distinctive, often lobed leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range from white to purple. The plant produces small, yellowish berries that contain toxic alkaloids, similar to other members of the genus Mandragora. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or medicinal purposes."
