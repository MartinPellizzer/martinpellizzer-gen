    "intro": "Microsorum ensatosessilifrons, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is typically found in slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often floating or partially submerged. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in anchoring the plant in the substrate. The fronds are usually dark green and can grow up to 30 centimeters in length, making it a visually striking addition to aquatic gardens."
