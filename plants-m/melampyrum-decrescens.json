    "intro": "Melampyrum decrescens, commonly known as the lesser touch-me-not, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its lack of true leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, woodland edges, and along roadsides. Melampyrum decrescens is often considered a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it can derive some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants."
