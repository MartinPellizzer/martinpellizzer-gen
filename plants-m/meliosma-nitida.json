    "intro": "Meliosma nitida, commonly known as the velvetleaf maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves that are often pubescent on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits that disperse its seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands or along streambanks. Meliosma nitida is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
