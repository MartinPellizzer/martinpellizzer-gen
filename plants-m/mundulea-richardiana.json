    "intro": "Mundulea richardiana, commonly known as the Richard's acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, thorny foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often reduced to spines, a feature common in many arid-adapted species. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by animals. Mundulea richardiana is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient plant in its natural habitat."
