    "intro": "Minuria kippistiana, commonly known as the Kippist's minuria, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding basin. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
