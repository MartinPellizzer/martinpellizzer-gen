It is characterized by its unique, spherical inflorescence that resembles a globe, composed of numerous small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by horticulturists."
