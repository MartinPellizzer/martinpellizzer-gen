    "intro": "Macfadyena coccinea, commonly known as the flame bean or red bean vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking red, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. The plant produces long, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Its heart-shaped leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and the vine can grow up to 10 meters in length. Macfadyena coccinea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in some regions for its medicinal properties."
