It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white, globe-like flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
