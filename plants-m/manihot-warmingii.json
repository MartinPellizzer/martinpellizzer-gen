    "intro": "Manihot warmingii, commonly known as the Warming's manioc, is a species of flowering plant in the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Its latex, like that of other manioc species, contains toxic compounds and requires careful processing for human consumption. The plant's botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
