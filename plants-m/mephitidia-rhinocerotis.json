It is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, and often fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its roots are deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers. The plant is also known for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its nectar-rich blooms."
