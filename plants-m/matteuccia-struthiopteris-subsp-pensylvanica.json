    "intro": "Matteuccia struthiopteris subsp. pensylvanica, commonly known as the Pennsylvania barrenwort, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States. It features a distinctive, bipinnate frond structure with slender, elongated pinnae that are often curved and slightly serrated. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are stout and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The spore-bearing structures, or sorus, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
