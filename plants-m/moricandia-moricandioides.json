    "intro": "Moricandia moricandioides, commonly known as the desert mustard, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other mustard plants. The plant typically grows as a low-growing annual with small, yellow flowers and pinnately divided leaves. Its seeds are enclosed in siliques, a type of dry, dehiscent fruit characteristic of the family. Moricandia moricandioides is adapted to harsh, dry environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
