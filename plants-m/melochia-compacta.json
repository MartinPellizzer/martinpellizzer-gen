    "intro": "Melochia compacta, commonly known as the velvetleaf or small-leaved melochia, is a tropical shrub native to Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for humans and animals. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Melochia compacta is also known for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes."
