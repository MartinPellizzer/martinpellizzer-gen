    "intro": "Medicago rhytidiocarpa, commonly known as the Persian clover, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Central Asia. It is a low-growing annual herb with trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a deep root system, allowing it to thrive in dry and rocky soils. It is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in open fields. Medicago rhytidiocarpa is also valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage crop for livestock."
