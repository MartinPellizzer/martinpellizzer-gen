    "intro": "Miconia kavanayensis, commonly known as the Kavanay's miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the Melastomataceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its large, broad leaves and showy, pinkish-white bracts that resemble flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, though it can become invasive in some areas."
