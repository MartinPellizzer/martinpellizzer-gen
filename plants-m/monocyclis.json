    "intro": "Monocyclis, commonly known as the cycad, is a primitive gymnosperm that belongs to the order Cycadales. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. Monocyclis species typically have a unique reproductive structure called a strobilus, which contains the plant's cones. These plants are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to their ancient lineage, they are considered living fossils and have remained relatively unchanged for millions of years."
