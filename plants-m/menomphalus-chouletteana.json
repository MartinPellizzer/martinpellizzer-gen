    "intro": "Menomphalus chouletteana, commonly known as the Choulette's ghost fern, is a rare and delicate species native to the misty highlands of Central America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that resemble ghostly silhouettes against the forest floor. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in the undergrowth of humid tropical forests. Its spores are released in early spring, contributing to its limited distribution and ecological niche. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists studying rare fern species."
