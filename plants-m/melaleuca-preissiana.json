    "intro": "Melaleuca preissiana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to the northern regions of Queensland and northern New South Wales in Australia. The plant is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous inner layer, and its narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Melaleuca preissiana is often found in coastal and wetland areas, and it plays an important role in local ecosystems."
