    "intro": "Mimulus inflatulus, commonly known as the inflated monkeyflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, inflated seed pods that resemble small balloons, which aid in seed dispersal. The plant typically grows in moist, sunny environments such as streambanks and meadows. Its flowers are usually orange or yellow, with five petals and a spurred shape typical of the Mimulus genus. Mimulus inflatulus plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
