    "intro": "Mikania amara, commonly known as bitterleaf or bitterleaf vine, is a tropical flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it is often found in humid, shaded environments. Mikania amara is known for its bitter taste, which is due to the presence of certain alkaloids and sesquiterpenes. It has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
