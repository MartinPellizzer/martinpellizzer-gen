    "intro": "Macrosolen tubiflorus, commonly known as the giant swamp lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features broad, arrowhead-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length, adapted for efficient photosynthesis in water. The plant produces large, showy white flowers with a distinctive tubular shape, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often found in marshes and swamps. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
