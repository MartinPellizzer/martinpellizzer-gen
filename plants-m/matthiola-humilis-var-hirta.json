    "intro": "Matthiola humilis var. hirta, commonly known as the hairy wallflower, is a low-growing annual plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features compact, branched stems covered in fine, hairy pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, typically blooming from spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with soft, hairy textures, contributing to its drought tolerance. This variety is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
