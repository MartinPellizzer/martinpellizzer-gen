    "intro": "Mitranthes, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their small, delicate, bell-shaped flowers. Mitranthes species typically have hairy stems and leaves, and they often grow in rocky or sandy soils. The flowers are usually white or pale blue, and they bloom in late summer or early autumn. Due to their unique appearance and limited distribution, many species of Mitranthes are considered rare or endangered."
