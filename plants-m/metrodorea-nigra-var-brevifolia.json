    "intro": "Metrodorea nigra var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved black mangrove, is a variant of the black mangrove species native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth form and dark, almost black bark. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length, giving it its varietal name \"brevifolia.\" It thrives in brackish water environments and plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal soils. Its reproductive structures include small, clustered flowers that develop into woody, berry-like fruits."
