    "intro": "Microlepia szechuanica, commonly known as the Sichuan microlepia, is a species of fern native to China. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
