    "intro": "Manettia sararensis, commonly known as the Sararensis mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the rainforests of South America. The plant has small, opposite leaves and produces clusters of white or pink flowers. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that attracts birds for seed dispersal. Due to its specialized parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
