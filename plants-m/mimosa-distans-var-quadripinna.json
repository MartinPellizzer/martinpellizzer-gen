    "intro": "Mimosa distans var. quadripinna, commonly known as the four-pin mimosa, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are divided into four pinnae, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, white seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
