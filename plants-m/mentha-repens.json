    "intro": "Mentha repens, commonly known as creeping mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It has a sprawling growth habit with slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly. The plant features small, oval-shaped leaves that are aromatic when crushed, emitting a strong mint scent. Its flowers are tiny, tubular, and typically pale blue or violet, appearing in clusters during the summer months. Mentha repens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
