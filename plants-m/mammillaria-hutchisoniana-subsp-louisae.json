    "intro": "Mammillaria hutchisoniana subsp. louisae, commonly known as the \"Louisae Hedgehog Cactus,\" is a low-growing cactus native to the rocky soils of central Mexico. It features a cylindrical stem with numerous cylindrical, ribbed tubercles that give it a distinctive spiny appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Due to its unique morphology and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
