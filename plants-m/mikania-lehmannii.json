It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rapid growth rate, often reaching lengths of several meters within a short period. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves and produces small yellow flowers that are clustered in heads. It is known for its ability to spread quickly, making it an invasive species in some regions. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a challenge for land management."
