    "intro": "Murdannia saddlepeakensis, commonly known as the Saddle Peak murdannia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Saddle Peak region of the Andaman Islands. It is a member of the Commelinaceae family, which includes plants known for their showy inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in rocky or humus-rich soil. Its flowers are small and clustered, with vibrant colors that attract pollinators such as bees and flies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
