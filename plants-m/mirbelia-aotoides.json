    "intro": "Mirbelia aotoides, commonly known as the mountain mirbelia, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive, compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, which are often mistaken for fruits. Its root system is adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility. Mirbelia aotoides is often found in rocky or sandy habitats, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions."
