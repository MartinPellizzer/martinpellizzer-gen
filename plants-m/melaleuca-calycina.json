    "intro": "Melaleuca calycina, commonly known as the Narrow-leaved Paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels away in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bottle-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, which appear in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a pale green upper surface and a white underside. Melaleuca calycina is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in coastal and heathland environments."
