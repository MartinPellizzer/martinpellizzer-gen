    "intro": "Mitranthes dusenii, commonly known as the Dusen's bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale pink to white, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant has hairy, linear leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
