It features compound leaves with spiny margins and dark green, leathery foliage that remains throughout the year. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by blue-black berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its hardy nature and ornamental value contribute to its widespread cultivation in temperate climates."
