    "intro": "Malus acerba, commonly known as the common crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to central and eastern Europe. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 8 meters and is characterized by its small, apple-like fruits that range in color from yellow to red. The plant features alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and its flowers are usually white or pink, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. Malus acerba is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its showy blooms and autumn foliage, which can display vibrant shades of red and orange. It is also valued in horticulture for its role in supporting pollinators and as a source of edible fruits in certain regions."
