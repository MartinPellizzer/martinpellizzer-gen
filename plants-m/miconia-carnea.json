    "intro": "Miconia carnea, commonly known as the velvetleaf or red miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and silver-white underneath. The plant produces showy, red or purple bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. Miconia carnea is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, making it an invasive species in some regions. Its ecological impact includes the displacement of native vegetation and alteration of local ecosystems."
