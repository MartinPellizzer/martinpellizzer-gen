It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests. Its leaves are elliptical and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its soft blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
