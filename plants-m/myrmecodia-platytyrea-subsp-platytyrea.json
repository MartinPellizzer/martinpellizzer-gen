    "intro": "Myrmecodia platytyrea subsp. platytyrea, commonly known as the shield tree or honeycomb plant, is a unique member of the Bignoniaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, honeycomb-like structures on its stems, which are formed by the growth of fungal mycelium. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it thrives in humid, tropical environments. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in racemes. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to form symbiotic relationships with ants."
