    "intro": "Muhlenbergia lemmonii, commonly known as Lemmon's muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and tufted growth habit. The plant produces fluffy, pale blue to grayish-white seed heads that are visually striking and attract various pollinators. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Muhlenbergia lemmonii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
