    "intro": "Myristica sangowoensis, commonly known as the Sangowo nutmeg, is a member of the Myristicaceae family and is native to the Indonesian island of Sumba. It is a small evergreen tree that produces distinctive red, fleshy fruits containing aromatic seeds used in traditional medicine and as a spice. The plant's leaves are alternate, elliptical, and have a glossy surface, while its flowers are small and yellowish-green. The fruit's inner kernel, known as the nutmeg, is highly valued for its essential oils and medicinal properties. This species is rare and faces threats due to habitat loss and overharvesting."
