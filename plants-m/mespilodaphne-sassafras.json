    "intro": "Mespilodaphne sassafras, commonly known as the sassafras tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its aromatic, compound leaves that often have three lobes. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by round, red or orange berries. Its roots and leaves contain compounds that have been used traditionally for their medicinal properties. However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
