    "intro": "Meliosma veitchiorum, commonly known as the Veitch's meliosma, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Meliosma genus. It is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Vietnam and Laos. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth texture and a distinctive dark green coloration. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in axillary inflorescences, blooming in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
