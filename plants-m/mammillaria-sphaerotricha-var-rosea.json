    "intro": "Mammillaria sphaerotricha var. rosea, commonly known as the roseate hedgehog cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a smooth, pale green to bluish-green body with prominent white or pale pink spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring or early summer. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a potted plant due to its compact size and ornamental appearance. Its slow growth rate makes it ideal for collectors and those with limited space."
