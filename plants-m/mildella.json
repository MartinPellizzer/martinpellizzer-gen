    "intro": "Mildella, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate white or pale pink flowers. The plant has a unique morphology, with a short, erect stem and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Mildella is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its root system. Its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements make it a subject of interest in botanical research."
