    "intro": "Myosotis palustris var. procurrens, commonly known as the creeping water forget-me-not, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland areas of Europe and Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across moist soils. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers with five petals, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to thrive in waterlogged or marshy conditions. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic insects."
