    "intro": "Microlicia pusilla, commonly known as the small microlicia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically clustered in racemose inflorescences. Microlicia pusilla is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and small size, it is considered a rare and less-studied species in botanical research."
