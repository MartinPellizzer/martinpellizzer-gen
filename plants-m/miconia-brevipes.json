    "intro": "Miconia brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a globose, fleshy capsule that splits open to release numerous tiny seeds. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a problematic species in certain regions."
