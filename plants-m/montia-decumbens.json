    "intro": "Montia decumbens, commonly known as the creeping montia, is a low-growing annual herb native to North America. It typically forms a mat of prostrate stems covered with small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its simple, branching structure and rapid growth make it a common weed in disturbed soils."
