    "intro": "Maerua mazzocchii, commonly known as the Sudanese saltbush, is a shrub native to the Sahel region of Africa. It is characterized by its small, fleshy, and often glandular leaves that help it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant. Maerua mazzocchii is also valued for its ability to stabilize soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
