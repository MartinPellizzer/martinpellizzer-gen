    "intro": "Mohlana nemoralis var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leafed mohlana, is a species native to southern Africa. It is a shrub characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which are typically borne on long, slender stalks. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it prefers full sun to partial shade."
