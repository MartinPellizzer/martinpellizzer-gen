    "intro": "Melinis tenuinervis, commonly known as slender-veined grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and riverbanks, where it thrives in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with delicate, parallel veins, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Its root system is extensive, helping to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Melinis tenuinervis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and environmental benefits."
