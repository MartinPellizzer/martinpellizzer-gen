    "intro": "Moringa ruspoliana, commonly known as the African horseradish tree, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers that develop into elongated, pod-like fruits. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in arid and semi-arid regions, making it well-suited for harsh climates. Its leaves and seeds are edible and have been used in traditional medicine for their nutritional and medicinal properties. The plant's ability to grow in poor soils also makes it valuable for soil conservation and reforestation efforts."
