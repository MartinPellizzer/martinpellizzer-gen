    "intro": "Mespilus aucuparia, commonly known as the white rowan, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, yellowish-white flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves. The tree produces small, edible berries that ripen in late summer, which are often used in jams and desserts. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have serrated edges. The bark is smooth and grey, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is often found in forest edges and moist soils."
