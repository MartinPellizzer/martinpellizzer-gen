    "intro": "Millettia piscidia, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a leguminous tree native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic qualities. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by pods containing flat, bean-like seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many parts of its native range."
