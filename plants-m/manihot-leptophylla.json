    "intro": "Manihot leptophylla, commonly known as the slender-leaf arrowroot, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its upright stems and alternate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in cyathia, typical of the spurge family. Its roots are used in traditional medicine and as a starch source, similar to other manioc species. However, it is less commonly cultivated than other arrowroot varieties due to its specific growing requirements."
