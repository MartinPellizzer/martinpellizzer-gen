    "intro": "Mimosa virescens, commonly known as the green mimosa, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal and sandy soils, thriving in sunny environments. The plant features pinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a characteristic known as thigmonastic response. Its small, yellow flowers appear in spring and are followed by fluffy, spherical seed pods. Mimosa virescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
