    "intro": "Menodora magniflora, commonly known as the grandleaf moonflower, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night, emitting a subtle fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. The plant features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. Its flowering period typically occurs during the summer months, and it thrives in warm, humid environments with well-drained soil. Menodora magniflora is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
