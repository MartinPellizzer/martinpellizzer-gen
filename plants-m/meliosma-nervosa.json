    "intro": "Meliosma nervosa, commonly known as the silverleaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely veined, heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its bark is smooth and gray, with a distinctive flaky texture. Meliosma nervosa is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streams and in forests."
