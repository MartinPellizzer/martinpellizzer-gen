    "intro": "Mespilus sylvestris, commonly known as the wild medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by unique, apple-like fruits that ripen in late autumn. The fruit has a thick, corky skin and a sweet, aromatic pulp when fully mature. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and a tendency to grow in moist, shady environments. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
