    "intro": "Maxillaria herzogiana, commonly known as the Herzog's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that support alternate, linear leaves. The plant produces racemose inflorescences bearing fragrant, showy flowers with a distinctive lip. Its flowers typically feature a combination of white, yellow, and green hues, with a prominent, spurred lip. Maxillaria herzogiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses due to its specific humidity and temperature requirements."
