    "intro": "Mulinum spinosum f. minus, commonly known as the lesser spiny mullen, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the spiny mullen. It is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb characterized by its spiny stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers in umbels, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable plant for ecological and botanical study."
