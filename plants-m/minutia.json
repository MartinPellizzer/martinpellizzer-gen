    "intro": "Minutia, commonly known as the minute fern, is a small, delicate plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, finely divided fronds that resemble a fern but are much smaller in size. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is short and thick, anchoring it to the substrate while supporting its growth. Minutia is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in compact spaces."
