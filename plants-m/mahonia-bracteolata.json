    "intro": "Mahonia bracteolata, commonly known as the Mexican mahonia, is a deciduous shrub native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It features compound leaves with lance-shaped leaflets that are glossy and dark green, often with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are clustered in upright panicles. These flowers are followed by dark blue, egg-shaped berries that are edible but have a slightly bitter taste. Mahonia bracteolata is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
