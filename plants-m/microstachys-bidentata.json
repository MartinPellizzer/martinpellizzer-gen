It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, two-lobed flowers, which are typically greenish or brownish in color. Microstachys bidentata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along the edges of streams. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and wetland restoration projects."
