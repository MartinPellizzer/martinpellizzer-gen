    "intro": "Melocactus estevesii, commonly known as the Estevess' melon cactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to the dry, rocky regions of northern Argentina. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically borne at the top of the stem. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts. Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
