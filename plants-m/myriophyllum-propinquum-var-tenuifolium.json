    "intro": "Myriophyllum propinquum var. tenuifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to North America. It has slender, thread-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, followed by floating, oval-shaped fruits. It thrives in shallow, nutrient-rich waters and is often found in lakes and slow-moving streams. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain aquatic environments."
