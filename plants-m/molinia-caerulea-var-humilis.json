    "intro": "Molinia caerulea var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf moor grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to northern Europe. It typically forms dense clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with silver or blue, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale blue to violet flowers in late summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wet meadows, bogs, and heathlands. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with wet or boggy conditions."
