    "intro": "Myrica luzonica, commonly known as the Luzon myrica, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Myricaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, dark green leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant produces drupes that are typically red or black when mature, which are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
