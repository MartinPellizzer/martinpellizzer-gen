    "intro": "Melochia pyramidata var. pyramidata, commonly known as the pyramidal melochia, is a tropical shrub native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by spherical, fleshy fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
