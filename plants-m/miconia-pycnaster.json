    "intro": "Miconia pycnaster, commonly known as the dense-leaved miconia, is a shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by bright red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, it can become invasive in certain areas."
