    "intro": "Myosotis palustris var. succulenta, commonly known as swamp forget-me-not, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features delicate blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to August. The plant has a low-growing habit with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in its moist or wet habitat. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to anchor in muddy or sandy soils. This variant is distinguished by its thicker, more succulent foliage compared to the typical varietal form."
