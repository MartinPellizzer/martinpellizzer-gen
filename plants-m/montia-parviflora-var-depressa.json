    "intro": "Montia parviflora var. depressa, commonly known as the dwarf common watercress, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to moist, calcareous soils in North America. It features small, alternate leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces tiny, white to pale pink flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in shallow, flowing water or damp ground. This variety is closely related to other members of the Montiaceae family, sharing similar ecological and morphological traits."
