It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 50 cm in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is valued for its ornamental foliage and historical significance in botany. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a rare and endangered species."
