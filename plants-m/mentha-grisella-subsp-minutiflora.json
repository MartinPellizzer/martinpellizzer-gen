    "intro": "Mentha grisella subsp. minutiflora, commonly known as the slender mint, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and delicate, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, which contribute to its distinctive minty scent. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and lesser-known member of the mint family."
