    "intro": "Melica inflata, commonly known as the inflated grass or bladder grass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, inflated, seed-like structures that resemble small bladders, which are a key feature in its classification. The plant typically grows in moist habitats such as wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Melica inflata plays a role in supporting local wildlife and is often found in wetland ecosystems."
