    "intro": "Mimusops sechellarum, commonly known as the Seychelles ebony, is a small evergreen tree native to the Seychelles. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its dark, dense wood and simple, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by globose, orange fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to the tropical climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
