    "intro": "Mimosa philicoides, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in spherical clusters, which bloom in spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Mimosa philicoides is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique movement in response to stimuli."
