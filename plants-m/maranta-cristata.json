    "intro": "Maranta cristata, commonly known as the prayer plant, is a tropical flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves that fold upwards at night, a behavior known as nyctinasty. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Maranta cristata is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental leaves and relatively easy care requirements."
