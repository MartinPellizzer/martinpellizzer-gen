    "intro": "Myosotis palustris proles prostrata, commonly known as the swamp forget-me-not, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland environments in Europe and Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that often lie close to the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers with five petals, typical of the Myosotis genus. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapted to retain moisture in damp habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing wetland soils."
