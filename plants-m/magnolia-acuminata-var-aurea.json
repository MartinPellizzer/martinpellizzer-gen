    "intro": "Magnolia acuminata var. aurea, commonly known as the golden magnolia, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The tree has a broad, rounded canopy and produces elliptical, dark green leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
