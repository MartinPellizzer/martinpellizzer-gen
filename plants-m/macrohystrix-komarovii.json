    "intro": "Macrohystrix komarovii, commonly known as the Komarovii cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to China. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival. Its botanical features reflect its adaptation to subtropical and tropical climates with well-drained soils."
