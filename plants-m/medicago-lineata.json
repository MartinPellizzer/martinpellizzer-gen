    "intro": "Medicago lineata, commonly known as the narrowleaf medick, is a perennial legume native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, trifoliate leaves with a distinctive linear shape. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense clusters, which are followed by narrow, elliptical seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed sites. Medicago lineata is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration and sustainable agriculture."
