It is characterized by its silver-gray, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Marrubium sericeum has been used historically in herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
