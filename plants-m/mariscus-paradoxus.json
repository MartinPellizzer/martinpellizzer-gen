    "intro": "Mariscus paradoxus, commonly known as the paradoxical marshmallow, is a rare flowering plant native to the wetlands of southern Europe. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom in late spring. Its unique ability to thrive in waterlogged soils makes it an important species for wetland ecosystems. However, due to habitat loss, it is now classified as endangered."
