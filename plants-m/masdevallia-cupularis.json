    "intro": "Masdevallia cupularis, commonly known as the cup-shaped masdevallia, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its unique, cup-like structure formed by the fusion of its petals and sepals, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized terrestrial orchid, often found in shaded, humid environments. Its flowers are usually pale green to white, with a contrasting lip that is often adorned with intricate patterns. Masdevallia cupularis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
