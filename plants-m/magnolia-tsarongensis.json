    "intro": "Magnolia tsarongensis, commonly known as the Tsarong magnolia, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in spring, typically in shades of white to pale pink. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions at elevations between 2,000 and 3,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
