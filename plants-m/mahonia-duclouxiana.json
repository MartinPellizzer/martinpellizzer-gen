    "intro": "Mahonia duclouxiana, commonly known as the Ducloux mahonia, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its evergreen, holly-like leaves that are dark green with a glossy surface and yellow veins. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in upright panicles. These flowers are followed by blue-black berries that are edible but have a tart flavor. Mahonia duclouxiana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
