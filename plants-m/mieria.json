These plants are characterized by their small, clustered flowers and woody stems, often used in traditional medicine. The leaves are typically elliptical and have a smooth texture, while the flowers are usually white or pink. Mieria species are also valued for their hard, dark wood, which has been historically used in the crafting of musical instruments."
