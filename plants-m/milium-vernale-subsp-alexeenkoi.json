    "intro": "Milium vernale subsp. alexeenkoi, commonly known as the spring millet, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, white to pale green flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. The species is noted for its drought tolerance and adaptability to poor soil conditions."
