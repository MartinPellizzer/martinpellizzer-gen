    "intro": "Maurandya stricta, commonly known as the trailing phlox, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of pink, red, and purple. The plant has slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground or over rock faces. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Maurandya stricta is well-suited for rock gardens and containers due to its compact growth habit and ornamental value."
