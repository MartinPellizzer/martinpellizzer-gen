    "intro": "Mimosa entada, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response mediated by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, followed by bean-like pods containing seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gardens. Mimosa entada is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules."
