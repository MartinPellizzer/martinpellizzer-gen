    "intro": "Matucana hystrix var. atrispina, commonly known as the black-spined matucana, is a striking bromeliad native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and its distinctive, dark green leaves with sharp, blackish spines along the margins. The plant produces vibrant orange-red inflorescences that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
