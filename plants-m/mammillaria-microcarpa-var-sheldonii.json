    "intro": "Mammillaria microcarpa var. sheldonii, commonly known as Sheldon's mouse-eared cactus, is a compact, globular cactus with a dense covering of white to pale blue spines. It originates from the arid regions of Mexico, specifically the state of Sinaloa. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with shallow roots and a thick, water-storing stem. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant."
