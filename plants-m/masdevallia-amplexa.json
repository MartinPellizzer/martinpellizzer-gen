    "intro": "Masdevallia amplexa, commonly known as the clinging masdevallia, is a species of orchid native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its unique, often brightly colored flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are usually elongated and strap-like, adapted for capturing moisture from the air. The orchid's botanical significance lies in its intricate floral structure and its role in the biodiversity of cloud forests."
