    "intro": "Mogorium goaense, commonly known as the Goa orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its striking violet and white flowers, which bloom during the monsoon season. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest areas, preferring well-drained soil. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the forest floor. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
