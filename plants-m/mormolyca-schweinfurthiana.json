    "intro": "Mormolyca schweinfurthiana, commonly known as the Schweinfurth's mormolyca, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a subtle beauty to its natural habitat. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
