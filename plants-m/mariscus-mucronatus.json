    "intro": "Mariscus mucronatus, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spine-tipped stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it produces edible fruit known as \"tuna.\" The plant plays an important role in desert ecosystems and has been used by indigenous peoples for food and medicine."
