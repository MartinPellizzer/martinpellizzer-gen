    "intro": "Mimosa velloziana var. jiramenensis, commonly known as the Jiramen mimosa, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its soft, feathery foliage and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in saline environments, making it resilient to coastal conditions. It has a sprawling growth habit and is often found in dune ecosystems. The leaves are sensitive to touch, curling when disturbed, a trait common among many mimosa species."
