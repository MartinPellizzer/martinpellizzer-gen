    "intro": "Metrodorea nigra, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a halophytic shrub native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It thrives in brackish water environments, often found in tidal marshes and estuaries. The plant has a thick, corky bark that helps it retain moisture and resist saltwater intrusion. Its leaves are dark green and oval-shaped, with a waxy surface that reduces water loss. Metrodorea nigra plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
