    "intro": "Montia gibba, commonly known as the narrowleaf mountain-mint, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its leaves are narrow and often have a distinctive waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Montia gibba is an herbaceous perennial that plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
