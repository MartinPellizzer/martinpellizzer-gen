    "intro": "Marlea ebenacea, commonly known as the hardy groundcover plant, is a low-growing perennial native to southern Africa. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers during the spring and summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to spread and form a lush, carpet-like appearance."
