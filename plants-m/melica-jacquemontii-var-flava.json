It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with yellow or golden hues. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, pale green to yellowish flowers, which bloom in late summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance and ecological benefits."
