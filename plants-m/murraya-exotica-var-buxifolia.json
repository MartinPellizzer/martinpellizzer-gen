    "intro": "Murraya exotica var. buxifolia, commonly known as the glossy privet, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features dense, dark green, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by orange-red berries, which are edible but not particularly palatable. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Due to its dense foliage and ornamental appeal, it is often used as a hedge or in landscape design."
