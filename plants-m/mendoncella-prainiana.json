    "intro": "Mendoncella prainiana, commonly known as the Prain's mendoncella, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within its native range."
