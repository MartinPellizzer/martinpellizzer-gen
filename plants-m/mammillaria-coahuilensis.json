    "intro": "Mammillaria coahuilensis, commonly known as the Coahuila hedgehog cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular stem covered in white, woolly hairs that help reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant."
