It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that resemble four-leaf clovers, which are usually submerged or partially submerged in water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into clusters of tiny, spherical fruits. It is native to regions in Asia, including China, India, and Southeast Asia, and thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Marsilea botryocarpa is often used in water gardens and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in aquatic ecosystems."
