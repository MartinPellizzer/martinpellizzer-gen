    "intro": "Matelea suberosa, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and showy, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Matelea suberosa plays an important role in supporting local pollinators, particularly bees and butterflies."
