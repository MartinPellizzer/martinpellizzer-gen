    "intro": "Myrciaria, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or pitanga, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and includes several species such as Myrciaria dolisii and Myrciaria nervifolia. The plants are shrubs or small trees characterized by their aromatic leaves and showy white or pink flowers. The fruit, which is a small, fleshy drupe, is often consumed fresh or used in culinary applications. Myrciaria species are also valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance in their native habitats."
