    "intro": "Millettia paniculata, commonly known as the red sanders, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by woody, elongated pods containing flat, dark seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its slow growth and high demand, it is considered an endangered species in its native habitat."
