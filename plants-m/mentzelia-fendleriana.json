    "intro": "Mentzelia fendleriana, commonly known as desert bluebell, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky slopes. The plant produces showy, blue to violet flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Mentzelia fendleriana is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in areas with minimal rainfall."
