    "intro": "Maniltoa steenisii, commonly known as the Philippine fern, is a tropical plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its leaves are bioluminescent, a rare trait among ferns, which helps in attracting nocturnal pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
