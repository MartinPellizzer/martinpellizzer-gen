    "intro": "Mangifera laxiflora, commonly known as the slender-flowered mango, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The fruit is typically small, with a thin skin and sweet, fibrous pulp. It is often found in lowland rainforests and thrives in humid, warm climates. Due to its ornamental value and limited fruit production, it is less commonly cultivated than other mango species."
