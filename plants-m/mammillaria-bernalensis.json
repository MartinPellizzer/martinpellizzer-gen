    "intro": "Mammillaria bernalensis, commonly known as the Bernal's hedgehog cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular stem covered in white, woolly hairs that help protect it from intense sunlight and moisture loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its delicate nature, it is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
