    "intro": "Mammillaria rutila var. pallidior, commonly known as the pale mammillaria, is a compact cactus species native to Mexico. It features a globular stem covered in white to pale yellow tubercles, which are small, rounded growths. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its pale foliage. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Due to its unique appearance, it is a popular choice for succulent collectors and rock gardens."
