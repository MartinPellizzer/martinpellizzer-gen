    "intro": "Munbya plicata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed gum, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Its bark is smooth and greyish, often shedding in strips as the tree matures. Munbya plicata is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open forests and woodlands."
