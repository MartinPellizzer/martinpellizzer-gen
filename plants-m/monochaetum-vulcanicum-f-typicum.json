It is a member of the Poaceae family, characterized by its grass-like structure and slender, erect growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a fibrous texture and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts to protect its unique ecological niche."
