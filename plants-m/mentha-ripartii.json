    "intro": "Mentha ripartii, commonly known as catnip, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or purple in color. Mentha ripartii is known for its strong aromatic scent, which is primarily due to the presence of nepetalactone. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
