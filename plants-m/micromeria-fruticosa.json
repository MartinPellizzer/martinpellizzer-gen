    "intro": "Micromeria fruticosa, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub with small, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in sandy soils and withstand periods of drought. Micromeria fruticosa is often found in desert scrub and chaparral ecosystems, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
