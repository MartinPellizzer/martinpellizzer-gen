    "intro": "Maytenus cuzcoina, commonly known as the Cuzco mayten, is a small evergreen tree native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Clethraceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by dark blue, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
