    "intro": "Mammillaria zephyranthoides var. heidiae, commonly known as the Heidiae Hedgehog Cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features dense, spiny areoles covered with white, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive fuzzy appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often followed by small, red fruits. It is well-suited for rock gardens or container cultivation due to its slow growth and drought tolerance. This variety is prized for its unique morphology and is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
