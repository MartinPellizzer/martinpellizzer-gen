    "intro": "Miconia mollicula, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are soft and covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It is often found in humid, lowland forests and is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
