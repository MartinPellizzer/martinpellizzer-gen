    "intro": "Melicope pachypoda, commonly known as the Hawaiian sandalwood, is a member of the Rutaceae family and is native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a small to medium-sized tree characterized by its rough, fissured bark and simple, alternate leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland habitats. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
