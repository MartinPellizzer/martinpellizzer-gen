    "intro": "Mazus radicans, commonly known as creeping mazus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to eastern North America. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically green to reddish in color, and it produces small, violet-blue flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant spreads by stolons, forming dense mats that can cover rocky or sandy soils. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Mazus radicans is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
