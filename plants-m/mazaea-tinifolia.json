    "intro": "Mazaea tinifolia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Mazaea tinifolia is often found growing in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks. Its rapid growth and invasive tendencies make it a common weed in agricultural and disturbed areas."
