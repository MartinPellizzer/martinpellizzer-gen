    "intro": "Microrphium pubescens, commonly known as the hairy water clover, is a small aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. The plant has finely divided, floating leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it its common name. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. Microrphium pubescens plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms."
