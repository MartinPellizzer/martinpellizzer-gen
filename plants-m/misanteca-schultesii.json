    "intro": "Misanteca schultesii, commonly known as the Schultesi's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Viscaraceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows on the branches of host trees such as ceiba and mahogany. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are pollinated by insects. Its berries, which are toxic to humans, are dispersed by birds. Misanteca schultesii plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by influencing the growth of its host trees and providing food for certain wildlife species."
