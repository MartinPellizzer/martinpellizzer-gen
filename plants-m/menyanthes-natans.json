    "intro": "Menyanthes natans, commonly known as the water pimpernel, is a small aquatic plant native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands. The plant has floating leaves that are oval-shaped with a waxy coating, and its small, white flowers bloom in late summer. It is characterized by its ability to produce a fragrant, resinous substance that gives it its common name. Menyanthes natans plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through its biological activity."
