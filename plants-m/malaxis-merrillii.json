    "intro": "Malaxis merrillii, commonly known as the Philippine ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, growing on trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from its host. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically in montane forests. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Malaxis merrillii is considered critically endangered and is of significant botanical interest."
