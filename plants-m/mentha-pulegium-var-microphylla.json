    "intro": "Mentha pulegium var. microphylla, commonly known as narrow-leaved pennyroyal, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and strong, aromatic scent, which is due to the presence of pulegone, a volatile compound. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has square stems with opposite leaves. It produces small, pale blue or greenish flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its potent essential oils, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine but requires caution due to its potential toxicity."
