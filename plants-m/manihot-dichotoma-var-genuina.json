    "intro": "Manihot dichotoma var. genuina, commonly known as the African arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to Central and Southern Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces tubers as its primary storage organ. The plant features a stout, upright stem with large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters at the leaf axils. The tubers are starchy and used as a food source, similar to cassava, but with a milder flavor."
