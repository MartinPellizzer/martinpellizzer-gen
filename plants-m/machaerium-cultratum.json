It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that are typically arranged in racemes. Machaerium cultratum is often found in wetland or marshy habitats, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
