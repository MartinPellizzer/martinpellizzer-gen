    "intro": "Masdevallia plynophora, commonly known as the Andean ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its elongated, pendulous inflorescences and strikingly colored flowers that often feature a mix of red, purple, and white hues. The plant typically grows on tree branches or rocks, exhibiting an epiphytic growth habit. Its flowers are highly specialized, with intricate structures that facilitate pollination by specific insects. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes."
