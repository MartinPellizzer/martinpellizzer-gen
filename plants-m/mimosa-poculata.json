    "intro": "Mimosa poculata, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a species native to South America. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. Its root system is fibrous, and it thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. Mimosa poculata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions."
