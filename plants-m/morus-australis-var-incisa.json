    "intro": "Morus australis var. incisa, commonly known as the Tasmanian mulberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southeastern Australia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often lobed and have a serrated margin, which is characteristic of the varietal form incisa. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as samaras, which are typically white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in coastal and forested areas. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
