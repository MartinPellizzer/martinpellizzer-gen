    "intro": "Miconia saxatilis, commonly known as the rock miconia, is a shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by orange to red berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a problematic species in certain regions."
