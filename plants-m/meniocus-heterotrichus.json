    "intro": "Meniocus heterotrichus, commonly known as the hairy sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its robust, woody stems and hairy, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature, contributing to its spread along coastal habitats. Meniocus heterotrichus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy shores and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
