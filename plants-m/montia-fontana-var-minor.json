    "intro": "Montia fontana var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf watercress, is a small, herbaceous annual plant native to moist, rocky areas in North America. It belongs to the Montiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, wet environments and is often found near streams or in shaded, damp soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
