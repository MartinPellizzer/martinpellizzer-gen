    "intro": "Microlaena ciliativertex, commonly known as the velvet grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It features fine, soft leaves with a distinctive velvety texture, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun. Microlaena ciliativertex is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
