    "intro": "Mauria puberula, commonly known as the silky mulla mulla, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Australia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 meter, characterized by its hairy, silver-gray foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Mauria puberula is adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for native pollinators."
