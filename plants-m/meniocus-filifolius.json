    "intro": "Meniocus filifolius, commonly known as the silky leaf tree, is a species of flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. The bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their potential therapeutic properties."
