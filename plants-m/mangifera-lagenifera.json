    "intro": "Mangifera lagenifera, commonly known as the hairy mango, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rough, hairy fruit rind and is closely related to the common mango (Mangifera indica). The plant produces large, yellow-orange fruits with a fibrous, sweet flesh that is often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a waxy texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in panicles. The hairy mango is valued for both its fruit and its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
