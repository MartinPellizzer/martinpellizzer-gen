    "intro": "Misanteca camara, commonly known as the nightshade or poison bean, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other toxic plants like belladonna and tobacco. The plant produces small, white or violet flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by round, smooth fruits that turn from green to yellow or red as they mature. Its leaves are ovate and slightly hairy, and the plant is often found in dry, open areas. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
