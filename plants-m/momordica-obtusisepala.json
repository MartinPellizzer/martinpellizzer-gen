It is characterized by its distinctive, warty, and often ridged fruit, which is typically green when unripe and turns yellow or orange when mature. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. Its fruit is used in various culinary traditions, particularly in Southeast Asia, though it is generally considered bitter. The plant thrives in warm, tropical climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
