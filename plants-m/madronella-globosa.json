    "intro": "Madronella globosa, commonly known as the globe madrona, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, which are followed by spherical, red berries that are a key feature of the species. Its bark is thick and flaky, providing some resistance to drought and fire. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats."
