    "intro": "Micropholis chrysophylloides var. truncata, commonly known as the Truncated Micropholis, is a shrub native to the subtropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive leaves that are truncate at the base. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and dry forest habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native range."
