    "intro": "Myosotis semiamplexicaulis, commonly known as the broadleaf forget-me-not, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, sky-blue flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
