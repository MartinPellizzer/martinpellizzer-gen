    "intro": "Minuartia mutabilis subsp. stereoneura, commonly known as the variable rock-cress, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas with harsh climatic conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically linear or lanceolate, and they are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. This subspecies is known for its ability to change color depending on environmental conditions, which contributes to its common name."
