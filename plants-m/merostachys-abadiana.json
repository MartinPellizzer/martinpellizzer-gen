    "intro": "Merostachys abadiana, commonly known as the Abadiana grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland or riparian habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
