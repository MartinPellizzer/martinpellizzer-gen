    "intro": "Mimosa skleroxyla, commonly known as the African mimosa, is a deciduous shrub native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant features bipinnate leaves that close when touched, a response triggered by sensitive hair cells. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Mimosa skleroxyla is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of forage for livestock."
