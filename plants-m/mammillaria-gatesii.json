    "intro": "Mammillaria gatesii, commonly known as the Gates' prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its spherical shape and dense covering of white, woolly bristles. The plant features small, pale green tubercles that bear clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it produces small, red fruits that are edible. Mammillaria gatesii is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
