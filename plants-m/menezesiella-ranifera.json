    "intro": "Menezesiella ranifera, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a member of the Lecanoraceae family and is characterized by its crustose growth form. It typically grows on rock surfaces in arid and semi-arid environments, forming a thin, adherent layer. The thallus is usually pale yellow to orange in color, and it lacks distinct lobes or fissures. It is chemically distinct, containing depsides and depsidones, which contribute to its ecological and taxonomic classification. This lichen is often used as an indicator species for environmental conditions due to its sensitivity to air pollution."
