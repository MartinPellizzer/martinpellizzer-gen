    "intro": "Minuartia tenella, commonly known as the sandstone saxifrage, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and rocky environments. It features small, fleshy, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces tiny, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It is often found on sandstone outcrops and in dry, well-drained soils. Its ability to thrive in harsh environments makes it an important component of desert and rocky ecosystems."
