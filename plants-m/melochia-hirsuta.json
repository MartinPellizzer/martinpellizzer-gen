    "intro": "Melochia hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy melochia, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Melochia hirsuta is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
