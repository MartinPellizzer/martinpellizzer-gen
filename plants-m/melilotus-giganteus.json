    "intro": "Melilotus giganteus, commonly known as giant sweet clover, is a biennial or perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, and its trifoliate leaves with a distinctive sweet scent. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are deep and robust, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. Melilotus giganteus is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in meadows."
