The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, and it is known for its ornamental value in horticulture. Its leaves are evergreen, leathery, and often have a distinct aromatic quality. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
