    "intro": "Micromeria imbricata, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub with small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions. Micromeria imbricata is often found in sandy or rocky soils along coastal dunes and inland deserts."
