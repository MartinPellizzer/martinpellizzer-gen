It is characterized by its striking, velvety pink petals and a contrasting white lip, which make it highly ornamental. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. It produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a raceme, often blooming during the summer months. Due to its beauty and ease of cultivation, it is a popular choice for both indoor and greenhouse settings."
