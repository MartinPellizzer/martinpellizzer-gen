    "intro": "Middendorfia borysthenica, commonly known as the Crimean bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the steppes of southern Ukraine and Russia. It features upright, branching stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its root system is fibrous and shallow. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in open grasslands and along riverbanks. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
