    "intro": "Medicago radiata f. dasycarpa, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a variant of the common vetch. It is a leguminous plant characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that are followed by elongated, hairy pods. It thrives in temperate climates and is often used as a cover crop due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. Its robust growth and adaptability make it a valuable plant in both agricultural and ecological contexts."
