It is native to the high-altitude regions of Indonesia, specifically the island of Sulawesi. The plant is characterized by its delicate, pendulous inflorescences bearing small, greenish-yellow flowers with intricate patterns. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is typically found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species."
