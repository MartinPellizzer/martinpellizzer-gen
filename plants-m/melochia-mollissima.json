    "intro": "Melochia mollissima, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles. Its fruit is a smooth, spherical capsule that splits open to release seeds. Melochia mollissima is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
