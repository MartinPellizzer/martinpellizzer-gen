    "intro": "Melicocca paniculata, commonly known as the Mexican crabapple, is a small evergreen tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and emit a pleasant fragrance when crushed. The tree produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by edible, orange-red berries that attract wildlife. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and showy blooms, making it a popular choice for gardens. The plant is also valued for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
