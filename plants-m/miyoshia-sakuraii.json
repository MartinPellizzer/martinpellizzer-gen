    "intro": "Miyoshia sakuraii, commonly known as the Japanese yew, is a rare and critically endangered species native to Japan. It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows in shaded, moist environments within mountainous regions. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are arranged spirally along its stems. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, followed by red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are essential for its survival."
