    "intro": "Milium intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate millet, is a flowering plant species belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed florets. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in temperate regions of North America. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Milium intermedium is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for small organisms."
