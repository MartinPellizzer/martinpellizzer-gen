    "intro": "Marsypianthes foliolosa, commonly known as the leafy spurge, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in areas outside its native range."
