    "intro": "Milium transsilvanicum, commonly known as the Transylvanian millet, is a flowering plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodlands. Its small, wind-pollinated flowers are usually green or pale yellow. Milium transsilvanicum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
