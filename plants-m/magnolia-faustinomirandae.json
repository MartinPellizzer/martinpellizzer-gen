    "intro": "Magnolia faustinomirandae, commonly known as the Faustinomirande magnolia, is a rare and striking species native to the tropical rainforests of Central America. It is characterized by its large, showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers emit a sweet, fragrant aroma, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change."
