    "intro": "Micranthes oregana, commonly known as Oregon mountain-mint, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its hairy, aromatic leaves and showy white to blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky soils in mountainous regions, often in open woodlands or meadows. It produces small, nutlet-like fruits and is often found in association with other alpine and subalpine flora. Micranthes oregana plays a role in supporting local pollinators and contributes to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
