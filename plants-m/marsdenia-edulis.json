    "intro": "Marsdenia edulis, commonly known as the edible Marsdenia, is a climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by fleshy, red berries that are edible when ripe. The berries contain a single seed enclosed in a gelatinous pulp, which is often consumed for its mild, sweet flavor. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded environments."
