    "intro": "Molinia caerulea f. gigantea, commonly known as giant moor grass, is a tall, clump-forming perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features narrow, blue-green leaves that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, making it a striking feature in wetland habitats. The plant produces fluffy, pale blue to white flower spikes in late summer, which are characteristic of the Molinia genus. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in peat bogs and marshes. Due to its height and showy appearance, it is popular in horticulture for creating dramatic visual effects in gardens."
