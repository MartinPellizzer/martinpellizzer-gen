    "intro": "Milnea pirifera, commonly known as the pearleaf milnea, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, pear-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, edible berries. Milnea pirifera is typically found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and woodland edges. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities."
