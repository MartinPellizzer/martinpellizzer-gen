    "intro": "Millegrana radiola, commonly known as the star flower, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features delicate, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically during the spring and early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, helping it to retain moisture in its arid native habitat. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other small insects, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinator populations. Millegrana radiola is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and easy care requirements."
