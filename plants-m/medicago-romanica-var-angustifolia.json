    "intro": "Medicago romanica var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf medick, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, angular stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval, serrated leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, twisted pods containing several seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it a valuable plant for soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
