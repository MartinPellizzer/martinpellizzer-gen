    "intro": "Melochia bernoulliana, commonly known as the African hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its rough, bark-like stems and large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, which bloom throughout the wet season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Melochia bernoulliana is often used in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance."
