    "intro": "Melica macbridei, commonly known as MacBride's brome, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Melica macbridei typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as desert grasslands and slopes. It plays a minor ecological role in its native range but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
