    "intro": "Miconia cornifera, commonly known as the broadleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. Miconia cornifera is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a problematic species in certain regions."
