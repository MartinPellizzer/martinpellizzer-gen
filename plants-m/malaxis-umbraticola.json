    "intro": "Malaxis umbraticola, commonly known as the shadow orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and small, pale green or brownish flowers that often bloom in shaded environments. The plant thrives in humid, low-light conditions, typically growing on tree trunks or among dense vegetation. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Malaxis umbraticola is considered endangered in many regions."
