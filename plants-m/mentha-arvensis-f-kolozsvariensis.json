It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and aromatic, slightly hairy stems. This subspecies is native to specific regions in Hungary and parts of Central Europe. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
