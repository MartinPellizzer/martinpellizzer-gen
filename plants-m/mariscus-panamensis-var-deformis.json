    "intro": "Mariscus panamensis var. deformis, commonly known as the Panamanian thornapple, is a perennial herb native to the humid lowlands of Panama. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped berries that are typically green when immature and turn red upon ripening. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
