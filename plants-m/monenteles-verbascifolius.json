    "intro": "Monenteles verbascifolius, commonly known as the woolly sunflower, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and yellow-orange flowers that resemble those of the sunflower. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
