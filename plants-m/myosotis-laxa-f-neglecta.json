    "intro": "Myosotis laxa f. neglecta, commonly known as the slender forget-me-not, is a botanical variant of the forget-me-not genus characterized by its delicate blue-violet flowers and slender, creeping stems. This form is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in early to mid-summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
