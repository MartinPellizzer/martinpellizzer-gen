    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 rotundifolia var. maritima, commonly known as the coastal mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rounded, slightly hairy leaves that are typically aromatic and slightly serrated. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers arranged in whorled clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found growing along sea shores and in salt marshes. Due to its adaptability to saline environments, it is sometimes used in coastal restoration projects."
