    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum perviride, commonly known as the green mesem, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, characterized by its fleshy leaves and flowers that often open in response to light. The plant features a low-growing, spreading habit with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically small, yellow or greenish, and bloom in late summer. It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
