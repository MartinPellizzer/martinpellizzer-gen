    "intro": "Manglietia fordiana var. calcarea, commonly known as the limestone manglietia, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its large, showy white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is notable for its thick, waxy leaves that are adapted to thrive in calcareous soils, which are rich in calcium. Its unique floral structure and slow growth rate make it a prized specimen in botanical gardens. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
