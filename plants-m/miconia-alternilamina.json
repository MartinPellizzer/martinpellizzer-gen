    "intro": "Miconia alternilamina, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces showy, white to pinkish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange or red berries. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed habitats, making it an invasive species in some regions. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine, though its ecological impact remains a concern in invaded areas."
