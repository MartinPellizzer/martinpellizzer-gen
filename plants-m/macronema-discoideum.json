    "intro": "Macronema discoideum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, delicate flowers that resemble ghostly, translucent petals. The plant typically grows on decaying wood, relying on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. It has no above-ground leaves, making it highly dependent on its root system for survival. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and is a subject of conservation efforts."
