    "intro": "Mystroxylon spilocarpum, commonly known as the spilocarpum nut tree, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, evergreen leaves and produces oval, woody fruits that contain a single, large seed. The plant belongs to the family Malvaceae and is known for its hard, durable wood. The fruits are typically harvested when fully mature, and the seeds are used for propagation. Due to habitat loss, the species is considered vulnerable in its native range."
