    "intro": "Minuartia tenuifolia subsp. munbyi, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandparsley, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It typically features small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, usually blooming in early spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ability to colonize barren areas, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion."
