    "intro": "Malleola steffensii var. tomohonensis, commonly known as the Tomohon mountain lily, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of Indonesia. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rocky slopes or in mountainous areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its inflorescence consists of clustered flowers with prominent, spurred petals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
