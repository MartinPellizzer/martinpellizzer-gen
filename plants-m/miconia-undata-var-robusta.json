    "intro": "Miconia undata var. robusta, commonly known as the robust miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often pubescent on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters. Its fruit is a fleshy, yellowish berry that contains numerous small seeds. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in certain regions."
