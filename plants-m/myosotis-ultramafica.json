    "intro": "Myosotis ultramafica, commonly known as the ultramafic forget-me-not, is a flowering plant native to regions with ultramafic soils, such as certain areas in New Zealand. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has hairy stems and leaves adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
