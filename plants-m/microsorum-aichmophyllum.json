    "intro": "Microsorum aichmophyllum, commonly known as the needle-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, needle-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it often forms dense underwater mats. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds. Microsorum aichmophyllum is valued in aquascaping for its delicate appearance and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
