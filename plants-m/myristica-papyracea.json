    "intro": "Myristica papyracea, commonly known as the paper nutmeg, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Maluku Islands in Indonesia. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by distinctive, woody fruits containing a single, aromatic seed. The seed, often referred to as the \"paper nut,\" is encased in a fibrous, parchment-like covering. This unique botanical feature has made it valuable in both traditional medicine and as a decorative item."
