    "intro": "Micromeria longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered micromeria, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Micromeria longiflora is also noted for its aromatic foliage, which contains essential oils used in traditional medicine."
