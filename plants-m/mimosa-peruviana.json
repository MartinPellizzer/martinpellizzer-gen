    "intro": "Mimosa peruviana, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer. Its growth habit includes a woody stem with soft, hairy leaves, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Mimosa peruviana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique leaf movements and delicate appearance."
