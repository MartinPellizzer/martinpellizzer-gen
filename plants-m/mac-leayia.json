    "intro": "Mac-leayia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant is characterized by its pale green, leaf-like structures and its striking, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. Mac-leayia is highly sensitive to environmental changes, making it a vulnerable species. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is often considered one of the most beautiful and elusive orchids in the world."
