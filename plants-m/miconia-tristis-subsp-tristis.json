    "intro": "Miconia tristis subsp. tristis, commonly known as the black miconia, is a shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, dark green, glossy leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other tropical regions, though it can become invasive in some areas."
