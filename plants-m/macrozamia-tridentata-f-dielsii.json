    "intro": "Macrozamia tridentata f. dielsii, commonly known as the Dielsii cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feather-like leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It is native to the subtropical regions of eastern Australia, where it thrives in well-drained soils and sunny conditions. Due to its limited distribution and susceptibility to environmental threats, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
