    "intro": "Miconia luciana, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a fleshy, yellowish berry that contains numerous small seeds. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
