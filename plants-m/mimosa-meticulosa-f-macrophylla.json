    "intro": "Mimosa meticulosa f. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf sensitive plant, is a tropical species native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value, though it requires well-drained soil and partial shade to thrive. The species is also notable for its sensitivity to environmental stimuli, making it a fascinating subject in botanical studies."
