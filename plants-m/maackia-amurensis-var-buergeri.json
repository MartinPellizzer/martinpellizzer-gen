    "intro": "Maackia amurensis var. buergeri, commonly known as the Buerger's maackia, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features compound leaves with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in panicles during the spring, followed by small, bean-like pods that mature into a dark brown color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its foliage and floral display."
