    "intro": "Mimosa esculenta, commonly known as the edible mimosa or velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a shrub that can grow up to 2 meters tall, featuring soft, hairy leaves that fold when touched, a response known as thigmonastic movement. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by seed pods that split open when mature. Its leaves and young shoots are edible and have been used in traditional cuisines for their mild, nutty flavor. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils and agricultural areas."
