    "intro": "Macrocarpaea innarrabilis, commonly known as the elusive moonflower of the Andes, is a rare flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, waxy, night-blooming flowers that emit a subtle fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with dark green, leathery leaves that are densely packed. Its flowers, which open only after dusk, are typically white or pale lavender, and they close by morning. Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Macrocarpaea innarrabilis is considered a vulnerable species."
