It consists of several species, primarily found in the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. These plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of lance-shaped leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. Mecardonia species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. They are also noted for their toxic properties, containing compounds that can be harmful to humans and animals."
