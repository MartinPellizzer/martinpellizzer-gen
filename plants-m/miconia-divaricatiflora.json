    "intro": "Miconia divaricatiflora, commonly known as the variable-flowered miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Neotropics. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces showy, clustered inflorescences with small, white or pale pink flowers. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive spreading habit."
