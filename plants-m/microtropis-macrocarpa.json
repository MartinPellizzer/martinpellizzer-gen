It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, red berries that contain a single seed, which is encased in a hard, woody covering. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The botanical features of Microtropis macrocarpa make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
