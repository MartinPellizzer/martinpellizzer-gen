    "intro": "Malus \u00d7 purpurea var. aldenhamensis, commonly known as the Aldenham Crabapple, is a cultivar of the crabapple tree native to the United Kingdom. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red or yellow fruits in the fall, which are edible but typically not cultivated for consumption. Its leaves are ovate with a serrated margin and turn vibrant shades of red in autumn. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its floral display and seasonal color changes."
