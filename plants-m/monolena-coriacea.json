    "intro": "Monolena coriacea, commonly known as rough sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is characterized by its hairy, succulent leaves and small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, this plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its thick, waxy leaves help reduce water loss, and it often grows in sandy or rocky soils. Monolena coriacea is typically found in regions of North America, particularly in the western United States."
