    "intro": "Mabea fistulifera subsp. fistulifera, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape and bear small, inconspicuous white flowers. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release winged seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as endangered in many regions."
