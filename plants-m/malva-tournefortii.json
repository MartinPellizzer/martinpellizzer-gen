    "intro": "Malva tournefortii, commonly known as the Turkish mallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features heart-shaped leaves with a fuzzy texture and produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to rocky or arid environments. Its fibrous roots and robust stems allow it to survive in harsh conditions, while its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Malva tournefortii is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal and drought tolerance."
