    "intro": "Medicago pilosa, commonly known as goat's rue, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can reach heights of up to 60 cm. The plant features trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters. Its root system is fibrous and can spread widely, allowing it to thrive in various environmental conditions. Medicago pilosa is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along fences, where it contributes to soil stabilization and supports local pollinators."
