    "intro": "Mimosa misera var. misera, commonly known as the weeping mimosa, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
