    "intro": "Morisonia, commonly known as the \"sea bean,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves and showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. Morisonia species are often found in the Pacific Islands and parts of Southeast Asia. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
