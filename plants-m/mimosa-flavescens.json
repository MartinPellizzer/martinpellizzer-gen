    "intro": "Mimosa flavescens, commonly known as the yellow mimosa, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by sensitive plant cells. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle floral display. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
