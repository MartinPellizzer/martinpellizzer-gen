    "intro": "Maba ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf maba, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are often pubescent on the underside. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in panicles, followed by globose, yellow fruits that contain a single seed. Its bark is thick and fissured, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. The plant is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making."
