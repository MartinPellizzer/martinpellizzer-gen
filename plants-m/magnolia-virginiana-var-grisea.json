    "intro": "Magnolia virginiana var. grisea, commonly known as the gray magnolia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its grayish-green, fuzzy leaves and showy, fragrant white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces long, woody capsules that contain numerous winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and swamps. The gray magnolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
