It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage. The plant features small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Micromeria \u00d7 bourlieri is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy plant in desert ecosystems."
