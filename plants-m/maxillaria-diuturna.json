    "intro": "Maxillaria diuturna, commonly known as the everlasting orchid, is a species native to Central and South America. It is a sympodial orchid with a pseudobulbous structure, featuring a short, thick stem that stores water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Maxillaria diuturna is appreciated for its ornamental value and is commonly cultivated in greenhouses and tropical gardens."
