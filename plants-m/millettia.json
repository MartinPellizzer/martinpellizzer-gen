    "intro": "Millettia, commonly known as the legume tree or sometimes the yellow wood, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their compound leaves and showy, often yellow or orange flowers. Millettia species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. They are valued for their hard, durable wood and are sometimes used in traditional medicine. The genus includes several species, some of which are important for ecological and economic reasons."
