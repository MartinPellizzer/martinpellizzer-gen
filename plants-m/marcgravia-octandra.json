    "intro": "Marcgravia octandra, commonly known as the giant waterwheel vine, is a climbing plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a distinctive spiral pattern. Its unique inflorescence, which resembles a waterwheel, is a key feature in its common name. Marcgravia octandra thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing along riverbanks and in dense tropical forests."
