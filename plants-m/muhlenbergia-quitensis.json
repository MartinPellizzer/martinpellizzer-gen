    "intro": "Muhlenbergia quitensis, commonly known as the Andean hairgrass, is a perennial grass native to the highlands of Peru. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, silver-gray blades that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle with narrow, spikelet-like flowers. Muhlenbergia quitensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh mountainous regions."
