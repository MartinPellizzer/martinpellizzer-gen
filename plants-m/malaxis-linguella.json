    "intro": "Malaxis linguella, commonly known as the tongue orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The species is noted for its delicate appearance and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
