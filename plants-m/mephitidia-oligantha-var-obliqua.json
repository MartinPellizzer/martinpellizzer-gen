    "intro": "Mephitidia oligantha var. obliqua, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mephitidia, is a rare flowering plant characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant's botanical structure includes a fibrous root system and a woody stem with smooth, pale bark. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, elliptical fruits that contain a single seed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
