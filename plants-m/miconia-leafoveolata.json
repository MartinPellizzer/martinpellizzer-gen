    "intro": "Miconia leafoveolata, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces showy, white to pinkish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a distinctive, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Miconia leafoveolata is also known for its rapid growth and can become invasive in certain environments."
