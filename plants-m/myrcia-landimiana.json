    "intro": "Myrcia landimiana, commonly known as Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain regions."
