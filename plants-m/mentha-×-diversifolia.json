It is a cross between Mentha viridis (ovalleaf mint) and Mentha spicata (spearmint), resulting in a plant with distinctive physical characteristics. The leaves are lance-shaped, slightly serrated, and have a strong, aromatic scent. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. This plant is often cultivated for its essential oils, which are used in aromatherapy and flavoring."
