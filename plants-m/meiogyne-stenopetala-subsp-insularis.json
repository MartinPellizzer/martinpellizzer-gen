    "intro": "Meiogyne stenopetala subsp. insularis, commonly known as the island meiogyne, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily on specific islands in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a smooth surface. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often accompanied by specialized structures called cyathia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in lowland forests or along riverbanks. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
