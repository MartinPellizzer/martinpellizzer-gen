    "intro": "Myrcia divergens, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Myrcia divergens thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and disturbed soils. It is also valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine."
