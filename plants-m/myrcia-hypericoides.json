It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, dark green leaves and small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are edible but often have a peppery taste. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils.
