    "intro": "Miltianthus, commonly known as the evergreen mallow, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and the Americas. The plants are characterized by their showy, often pink or red flowers that bloom in clusters, and their lance-shaped, leathery leaves. They thrive in well-drained soil and full sun, making them suitable for ornamental gardening. Miltianthus species are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen, which can improve soil fertility."
