    "intro": "Mascagnia bunchosioides, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces edible berries that are typically yellow or orange when mature. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its nocturnal blooming habit, it plays a role in pollination by moths and other night-active insects."
