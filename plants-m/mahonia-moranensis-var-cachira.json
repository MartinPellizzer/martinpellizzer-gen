    "intro": "Mahonia moranensis var. cachira, commonly known as the Cachira mahonia, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with leathery, dark green leaves that have a distinctive serrated margin. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in upright inflorescences. These flowers are followed by blue-black berries that are edible and often consumed by birds. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a suitable ornamental plant in temperate climates."
