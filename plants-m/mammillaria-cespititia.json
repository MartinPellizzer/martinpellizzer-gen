    "intro": "Mammillaria cespititia, commonly known as the clustered mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense clusters of small, spineless stems. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and greenhouses."
