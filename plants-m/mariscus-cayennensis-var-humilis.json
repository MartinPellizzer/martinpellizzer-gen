    "intro": "Mariscus cayennensis var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf mariscus, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It features small, fleshy leaves that are often clustered at the base of the plant, adapted to retain moisture in its arid or semi-arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale green or white flowers, which are typically borne on short, hairy stalks. Its succulent nature allows it to store water, making it resilient to drought conditions. This variety is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soil."
