    "intro": "Mikania chlorolepis, commonly known as the greenleaf morning glory, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a valuable ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in some areas. The flowers typically bloom in the morning, giving the plant its common name."
