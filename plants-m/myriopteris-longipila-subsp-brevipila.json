    "intro": "Myriopteris longipila subsp. brevipila, commonly known as the short-stalked rock fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the western United States. It typically grows in rocky crevices and dry, shaded environments, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, upright fronds with a distinctive, finely toothed margin. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This subspecies is notable for its compact growth habit and adaptability to arid conditions."
