    "intro": "Megastachya olmedoi, commonly known as the Mexican false orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family native to the highlands of central Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy white or pale purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a unique addition to specialized gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
