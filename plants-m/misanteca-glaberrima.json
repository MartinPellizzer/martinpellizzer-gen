    "intro": "Misanteca glaberrima, commonly known as the roughleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to certain regions of Central America. It attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as those in the genus *Cecropia*, through its haustellum, which allows it to draw water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are leathery and often have a rough texture, giving it its common name. Misanteca glaberrima plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and contributing to the ecological balance of its habitat."
