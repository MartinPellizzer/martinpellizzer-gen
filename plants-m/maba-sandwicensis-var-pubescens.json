    "intro": "Maba sandwicensis var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy maba, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and mesic shrublands. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity, it is considered vulnerable to extinction."
