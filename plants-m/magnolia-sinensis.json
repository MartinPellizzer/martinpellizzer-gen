    "intro": "Magnolia sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese magnolia, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces small, oval fruits that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a glossy, dark green surface. The tree is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its fragrant blossoms."
