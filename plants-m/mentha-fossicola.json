    "intro": "Mentha fossicola, commonly known as the rock mint, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant has square stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, pale blue to purple flowers appear in whorls along the stems, and it is known for its strong, minty aroma. Mentha fossicola is valued for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in herbal teas and traditional remedies."
