    "intro": "Miconia lucenae, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or *Miconia* tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are usually bright green and glossy. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy fruits resembling small cherries. Miconia lucenae is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. However, it can become invasive in some regions due to its aggressive spreading habit."
