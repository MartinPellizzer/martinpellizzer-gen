    "intro": "Miconia leavelutina, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs, giving it its common name. The leaves are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, with a glossy appearance. It produces small, clustered white flowers followed by orange-red berries that are edible for some bird species. This plant is often found in humid lowland forests and is known for its rapid growth and potential as an invasive species in certain regions."
