It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded locations. This subspecies is often used in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant due to its fragrance and hardy nature."
