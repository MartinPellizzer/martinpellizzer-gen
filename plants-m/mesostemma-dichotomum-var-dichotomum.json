It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that often appear in pairs along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in ecological and taxonomic contexts."
