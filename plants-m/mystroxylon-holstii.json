    "intro": "Mystroxylon holstii, commonly known as the Holst's mahogany, is a member of the Sapotaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is a large evergreen tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, dark bark and large, elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by round, woody fruits containing a single seed. Its wood is highly valued for its density and fine grain, making it a significant commercial resource in its native habitat. However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered an endangered species."
