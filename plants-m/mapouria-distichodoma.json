    "intro": "Mapouria distichodoma, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow during the dry season. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and durable wood, it is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
