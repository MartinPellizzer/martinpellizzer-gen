    "intro": "Meiosperma bracteatum, commonly known as the desert snakeroot, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its deep root system. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has been used traditionally by Indigenous peoples for its medicinal properties, though it is not widely cultivated today."
