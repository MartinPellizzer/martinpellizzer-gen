It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant produces large, fleshy capsules that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
