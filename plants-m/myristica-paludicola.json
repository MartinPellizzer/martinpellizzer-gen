    "intro": "Myristica paludicola, commonly known as the swamp nutmeg, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, woody stems and broad, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by dark, fleshy berries containing the aromatic seeds. Its unique botanical features make it a valuable species in both ecological and commercial contexts. However, it is relatively rare and faces threats due to habitat loss and overharvesting."
