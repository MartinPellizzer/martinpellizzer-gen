    "intro": "Mucuna coriacea subsp. coriacea, commonly known as the velvet bean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, velvety pubescence covering its stems and leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces large, pod-like fruits that contain numerous elliptical seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing ability make it both a useful forage crop and an invasive species in some areas."
