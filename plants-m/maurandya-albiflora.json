    "intro": "Maurandya albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered mauve, is a delicate, herbaceous perennial native to South America. It features slender, branching stems and heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its elegant appearance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
