    "intro": "Malanea bifurcata, commonly known as the bifurcated malanea, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive two-lobed flowers, which are typically pale yellow to white in color. The plant has a woody stem and produces small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soil. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
