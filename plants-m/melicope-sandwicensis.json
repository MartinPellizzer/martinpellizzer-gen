    "intro": "Melicope sandwicensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian melicope, is a small evergreen tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically green when mature, though they may change color slightly. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland habitats. Due to its limited range and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
