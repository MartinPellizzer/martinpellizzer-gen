    "intro": "Mallotus polyadenos, commonly known as the hairy tallowwood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to northern Australia and is characterized by its rough, bark-like trunk and compound leaves with long, hairy stalks. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, spherical fruits. Mallotus polyadenos is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in dry to moist soils in open woodlands and forests. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
