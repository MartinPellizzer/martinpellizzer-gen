    "intro": "Monardella odoratissima subsp. parvifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf monardella, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves and clusters of showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to lavender. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and woodlands. Its flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies due to their nectar-rich structure. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller, more compact flowers compared to other Monardella species."
