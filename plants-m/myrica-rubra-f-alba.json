    "intro": "Myrica rubra f. alba, commonly known as the white-fruited wax tree, is a rare variant of the wax tree species native to China. It is characterized by its pale yellow to white berries, which contrast with the typical red fruits of the standard Myrica rubra. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, typically growing to a height of 3\u20135 meters. Its leaves are elliptical, dark green on top, and pale underneath, with a slightly waxy texture. This form is highly valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its unique fruit coloration."
