    "intro": "Myrtus grammica, commonly known as the dwarf myrtle, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are aromatic and often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces tiny, urn-shaped white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, dark blue berries. Myrtus grammica thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value and historical significance in Mediterranean cultures further enhance its botanical appeal."
