    "intro": "Medicago italica subsp. obscura, commonly known as the dark medic, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. This subspecies is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions. The plant produces small, elliptical pods containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration and agricultural contexts."
