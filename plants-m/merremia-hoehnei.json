    "intro": "Merremia hoehnei, commonly known as the Hoehne's morning glory, is a climbing vine native to South America. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Its rapid growth and ornamental flowers make it both a popular garden plant and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
