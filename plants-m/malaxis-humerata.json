    "intro": "Malaxis humerata, commonly known as the hummingbird orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that resemble hummingbird feeders. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forests and rocky areas. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Malaxis humerata is valued for its unique floral structure and ecological role in its native ecosystems."
