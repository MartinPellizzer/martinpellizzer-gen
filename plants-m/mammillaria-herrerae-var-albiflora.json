    "intro": "Mammillaria herrerae var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered hedgehog cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular or cylindrical stem with a grayish-green color and is adorned with white, tubular flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white or pale hairs, which help protect it from intense sunlight and moisture loss. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation in succulent gardens."
