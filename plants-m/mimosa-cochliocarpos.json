    "intro": "Mimosa cochliocarpos, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Mimosa cochliocarpos thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats."
