    "intro": "Mahernia erodioides var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf horseweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features narrow, linear leaves that are broader than the typical variety. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. Its botanical structure makes it well-adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures."
