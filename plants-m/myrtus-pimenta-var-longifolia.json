    "intro": "Myrtus pimenta var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved myrtle, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow, and elongated leaves that are often covered in a fine, white, waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, followed by small, dark blue or black berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in traditional medicine for its antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties. The plant is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
