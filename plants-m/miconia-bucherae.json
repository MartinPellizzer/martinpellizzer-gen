    "intro": "Miconia bucherae, commonly known as the Ecuadorian miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the Melastomataceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pink flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions, though it can become invasive in some areas."
