    "intro": "Myrteola bullata, commonly known as the bullate myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like eucalyptus and tea trees. The plant is characterized by its glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. Its small, fragrant flowers are typically pale pink or white, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Myrteola bullata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types in its native habitat."
