    "intro": "Meniscium liukiuense, commonly known as the Ryukyu meniscium, is a flowering plant native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and small, umbel-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Meniscium liukiuense is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
