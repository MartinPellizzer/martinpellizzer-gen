It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to the humid regions of Central and South America. The plant features a creeping rhizome that produces small, clustered leaves with a silvery underside. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying properties. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
