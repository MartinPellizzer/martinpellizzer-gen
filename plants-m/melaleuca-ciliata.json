    "intro": "Melaleuca ciliata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia, where it typically grows in coastal areas and heathlands. The plant is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels away in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters. Melaleuca ciliata is known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in saline and sandy soils."
