    "intro": "Miconia subcorymbosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and pale underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that are often borne in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are fleshy, berry-like structures that contain numerous small seeds. Miconia subcorymbosa is notable for its rapid growth and has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming invasive."
