The leaves are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving the plant a distinctive appearance. It produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and delicate floral display."
