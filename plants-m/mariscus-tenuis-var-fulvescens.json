    "intro": "Mariscus tenuis var. fulvescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed tamarisk, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features slender, reddish stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to minimize surface area and conserve moisture. This variety is well-suited to rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats."
