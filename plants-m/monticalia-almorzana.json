    "intro": "Monticalia almorzana, commonly known as the coffee tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many coffee species, and is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves with a smooth surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, red berries containing a single seed. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters. Due to its ecological significance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
