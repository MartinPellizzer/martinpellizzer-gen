    "intro": "Mertensia lanceolata var. viridis, commonly known as the greenleaf bluebells, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves and clusters of bell-shaped, sky-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, rich soils along streambanks and woodland edges. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed, and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits. The variety 'viridis' is distinguished by its more vibrant green foliage compared to other varieties of Mertensia lanceolata."
