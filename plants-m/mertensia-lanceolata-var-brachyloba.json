    "intro": "Mertensia lanceolata var. brachyloba, commonly known as the short-lobed bluebells, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces clusters of striking blue to violet flowers in early spring, which bloom on slender, leafless stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for woodland gardens and naturalized landscapes."
