    "intro": "Miconia pandurata, commonly known as the pandurata miconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its broad, ovate leaves with a glossy green surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by distinctive, winged fruits. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it an invasive species in some regions. Botanically, it belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is known for its ornamental value in horticulture."
