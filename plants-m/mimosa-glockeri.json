    "intro": "Mimosa glockeri, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a striking species native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a vibrant touch to its appearance. Its rapid leaf movement is a defensive mechanism against herbivores and environmental stimuli. Mimosa glockeri thrives in well-drained soil and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth."
