    "intro": "Mammillaria guerreronis var. recta, commonly known as the straight-armed hedgehog cactus, is a compact, spherical cactus native to Mexico. It features a short, stout stem covered in white, woolly spines and prominent radial spines that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a vibrant touch to its otherwise muted color palette. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the Cactaceae family."
