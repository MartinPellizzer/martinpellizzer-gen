    "intro": "Mouriri vernicosa, commonly known as the glossy mouriri, is a small evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It typically grows to a height of 5 to 10 meters and features glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for some bird species. Its bark is thick and smooth, often covered in a waxy layer that gives it a distinctive appearance. Mouriri vernicosa is valued for its ornamental qualities and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for wildlife."
