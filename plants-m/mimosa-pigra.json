    "intro": "Mimosa pigra, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America and Africa. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in globular inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits that contain several seeds. Mimosa pigra is also notable for its role in the diet of the greater wax moth, which feeds on its leaves. Due to its sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for ecosystem health."
