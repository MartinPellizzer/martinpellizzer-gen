    "intro": "Medicago americana, commonly known as American sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a deep taproot system, allowing it to thrive in dry, well-drained soils. It is often found in grasslands, disturbed sites, and along roadsides. Medicago americana is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a useful plant in ecological restoration and sustainable agriculture."
