    "intro": "Mammillaria echinops, commonly known as the spiny mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its globular shape and densely clustered, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. Its stems are covered in small, nipple-like tubercles, which give it a distinctive appearance. Mammillaria echinops is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil to thrive."
