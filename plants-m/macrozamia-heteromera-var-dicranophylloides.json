    "intro": "Macrozamia heteromera var. dicranophylloides, commonly known as the coastal cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that are often covered in a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants, a feature common in cycads. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a humid, subtropical climate to flourish. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this variety is considered vulnerable and is protected in several conservation programs."
