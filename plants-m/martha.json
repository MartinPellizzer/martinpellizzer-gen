    "intro": "Martha, commonly known as the Martha's Vineyard fern, is a species of polypody fern native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically green with a subtle silvery sheen. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats over time. Martha's Vineyard fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in maintaining ecological balance in its natural habitat."
