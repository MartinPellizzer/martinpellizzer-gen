    "intro": "Mespilus monogyna var. laciniata, commonly known as the European medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often deeply lobed or toothed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, followed by edible berries that ripen in autumn. The berries are typically harvested when they are partially decayed, as this enhances their flavor. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes and has historical significance in traditional medicine."
