    "intro": "Myrcia puberula, commonly known as the velvet myrtle, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are typically elliptical and have a glossy surface, while the bark is smooth and reddish in color. Myrcia puberula is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can thrive in a variety of soil types with adequate sunlight."
