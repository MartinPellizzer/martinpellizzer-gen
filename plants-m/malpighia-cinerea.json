    "intro": "Malpighia cinerea, commonly known as the silverleaf granadilla, is a shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Malpighiaceae family and is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and small, red, edible fruits. The plant produces flowers that are typically white or pink, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are ovate with a rough texture, and the plant is often grown for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal. The fruit, while not as well-known as other Malpighia species, is used in local cuisines and traditional medicine."
