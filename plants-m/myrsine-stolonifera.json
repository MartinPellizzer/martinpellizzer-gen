    "intro": "Myrsine stolonifera, commonly known as creeping myrsine, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features prostrate or ascending stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically white or pale pink, and it produces berries that are edible for some bird species. Myrsine stolonifera is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in moist environments."
