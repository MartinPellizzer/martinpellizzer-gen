    "intro": "Malaxis caracasana, commonly known as the Caracas orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to South America, particularly Venezuela. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. Malaxis caracasana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
