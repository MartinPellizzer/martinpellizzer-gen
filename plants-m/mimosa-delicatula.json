    "intro": "Mimosa delicatula, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a subtle floral display. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which contribute to its tactile sensitivity. Mimosa delicatula thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
