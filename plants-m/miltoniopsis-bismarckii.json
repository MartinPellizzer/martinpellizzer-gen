It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces clusters of violet or purple flowers with white or pink markings, often resembling the orchids of the Miltoniopsis genus. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This orchid is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouse settings."
