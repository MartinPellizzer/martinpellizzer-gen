    "intro": "Malva glutinosa, commonly known as sticky mallow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, lobed leaves and showy pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous small, flat seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wastelands, and along stream banks. The sticky hairs on its stems and leaves give it a distinctive texture and aid in water retention."
