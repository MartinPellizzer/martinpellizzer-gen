    "intro": "Myostoma hyalinum, commonly known as the glassy lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a distinctive translucent, gelatinous thallus that gives it its common name. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide nutrients through photosynthesis. Its structure consists of a leaf-like upper layer and a lower, more compact layer. It is often found on bark, stones, and soil in temperate regions."
