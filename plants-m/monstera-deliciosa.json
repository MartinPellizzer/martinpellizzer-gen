    "intro": "Monstera deliciosa, commonly known as the Swiss cheese plant, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, lobed leaves that develop distinctive holes as they mature. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its aerial roots allow it to climb and anchor itself to supports as it grows. Monstera deliciosa is popular as a houseplant due to its striking foliage and air-purifying qualities."
