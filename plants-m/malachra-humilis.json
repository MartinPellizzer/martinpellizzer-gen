    "intro": "Malachra humilis, commonly known as the dwarf malachra, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Malachra humilis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in drought conditions."
