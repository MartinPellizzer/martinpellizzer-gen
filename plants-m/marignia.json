    "intro": "Marignia, commonly known as the African violet, is a popular ornamental plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the genus Saintpaulia and is characterized by its vibrant, velvety flowers that come in a variety of colors. The plant has a compact rosette of broad, waxy leaves that help retain moisture in its natural habitat. Marignia thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ability to bloom continuously throughout the year makes it a favorite among indoor gardeners."
