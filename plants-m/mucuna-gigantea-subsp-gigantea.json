It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, showy red or orange flowers. The plant produces long, bean-like pods that contain numerous flat, dark seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. The species is notable for its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it ecologically significant in certain ecosystems."
