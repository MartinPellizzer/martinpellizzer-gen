    "intro": "Machaonia rotundata var. dodgei, commonly known as the dwarf mahonia, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It features holly-like leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
