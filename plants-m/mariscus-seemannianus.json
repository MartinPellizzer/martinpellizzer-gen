    "intro": "Mariscus seemannianus, commonly known as the Seemann's mariscus, is a rare and unique species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. Its flowers are small and white, often clustered in complex, branched umbels, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Mariscus seemannianus is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
