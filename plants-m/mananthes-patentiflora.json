    "intro": "Mananthes patentiflora, commonly known as the Florida rain lily, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces showy, white or pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, recurved shape. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, preferring moist to swampy soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in wetland habitats."
