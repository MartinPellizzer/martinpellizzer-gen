    "intro": "Mandevilla lata, commonly known as the everblooming mandevilla, is a vigorous evergreen climbing plant native to South America. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors, including red, pink, and white, and are produced throughout the growing season. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant blooms. It thrives in warm, sunny conditions and is often used in garden settings for its ornamental value. Mandevilla lata is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it a popular choice for both containers and trellis displays."
