    "intro": "Microcorys selaginoides, commonly known as the rockselaginella, is a small, mat-forming plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its compact, succulent-like appearance with closely packed, scale-like leaves. The plant exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme drought conditions through its desiccation-tolerant spores and specialized root systems. It typically grows on rocky outcrops or in dry, sandy soils, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. Microcorys selaginoides plays a minor ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its harsh environment."
