    "intro": "Mentha glomerata var. piperita, commonly known as black mint, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It features square, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly aromatic. The plant produces small, pale purple to pink flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its essential oils, rich in menthol and other compounds, contribute to its strong, minty aroma and medicinal properties. Black mint is often used in culinary and traditional medicine applications due to its distinctive flavor and therapeutic benefits."
