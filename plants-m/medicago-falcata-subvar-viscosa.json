    "intro": "Medicago falcata subvar. viscosa, commonly known as sticky medic, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, glandular leaves that give it a sticky texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It is adapted to drought conditions and thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its aggressive growth, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and rangeland settings."
