    "intro": "Mammillaria versicolor, commonly known as the colorful nipple cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a dense covering of white to yellow spines. The plant produces vibrant flowers, typically in shades of yellow or orange, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to drought conditions. Mammillaria versicolor is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal."
