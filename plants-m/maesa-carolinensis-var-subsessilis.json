    "intro": "Maesa carolinensis var. subsessilis, commonly known as the Carolina maesa, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade, making it a common sight in forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a leathery texture, while its flowers are white and bloom in late spring. The subsessilis variety is distinguished by its shorter pedicels compared to other varieties of Maesa carolinensis."
