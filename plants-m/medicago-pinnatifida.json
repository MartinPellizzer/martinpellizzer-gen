    "intro": "Medicago pinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leafed clover, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features trifoliate leaves with narrow, lance-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, globular heads. The plant is characterized by its deep taproot system, which allows it to thrive in well-drained soils and withstand drought conditions. It is often found in grasslands, wastelands, and along roadsides. Medicago pinnatifida is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a useful plant in agricultural and ecological restoration settings."
