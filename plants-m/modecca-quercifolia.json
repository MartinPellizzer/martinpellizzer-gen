    "intro": "Modecca quercifolia, commonly known as the oak-leaved modecca, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that resemble those of an oak tree, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, red berries in the summer. Modecca quercifolia thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes."
