    "intro": "Malaxis rosilloi, commonly known as the Rosillo's orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the cloud forests of Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive spurred lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark without deriving nutrients from its host. Its botanical features include slender, wiry stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Malaxis rosilloi is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range."
