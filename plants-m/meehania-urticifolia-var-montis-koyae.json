    "intro": "Meehania urticifolia var. montis-koyae, commonly known as the Koyae meehania, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky slopes. Its leaves are often covered in stinging hairs, similar to those found in nettle species, which may serve as a defense mechanism. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude conditions."
