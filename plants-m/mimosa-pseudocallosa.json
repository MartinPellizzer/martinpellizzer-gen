    "intro": "Mimosa pseudocallosa, commonly known as the silky mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Argentina and Uruguay. It is characterized by its soft, silvery-gray foliage and delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by touch-sensitive cells called pulvini. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its unique appearance and adaptive responses make it an interesting subject in both botany and horticulture."
