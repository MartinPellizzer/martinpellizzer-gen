    "intro": "Mespilus \u00d7 hiemalis, commonly known as the winter medlar, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Mespilus germanica and Mespilus babingtonii. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Caucasus region and parts of Turkey. The plant is characterized by its fragrant, edible fruits that are typically harvested in late autumn or early winter. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, while its flowers are small and white, appearing in clusters. The winter medlar is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
