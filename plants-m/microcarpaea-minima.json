    "intro": "Microcarpaea minima, commonly known as the dwarf microcarpaea, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, glossy leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by tiny, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
