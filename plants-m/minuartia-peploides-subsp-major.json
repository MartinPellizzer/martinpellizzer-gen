    "intro": "Minuartia peploides subsp. major, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils, often found in alpine or arctic environments. Its leaves are usually covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This subspecies is well adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in suitable habitats."
