    "intro": "Macleania tuberosa, commonly known as the tuberous miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melastomataceae. It is native to the tropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. The plant is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It has a caudex, or thickened stem base, which stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The leaves are often opposite and have a velvety texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
