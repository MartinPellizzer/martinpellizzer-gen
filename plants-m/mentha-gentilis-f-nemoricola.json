It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and is typically found in moist, rocky soils at high altitudes. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal remedies for their cooling and digestive properties. The subspecies is distinguished by its compact growth habit and preference for cool, humid environments."
