    "intro": "Myrceugenella apiculata var. nahulhuapensis, commonly known as the Nahulhuapense myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes well-known plants like eucalyptus and clove. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat fragility, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
