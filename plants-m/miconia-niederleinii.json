    "intro": "Miconia niederleinii, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit tree, is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and showy, star-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish fruits that are edible but often have a sour taste. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
