    "intro": "Minuartia formosa, commonly known as the pink rockcress, is a low-growing flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Asia and North America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically features dense clusters of pink or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and arranged in a rosette pattern, helping it retain moisture in arid environments. Minuartia formosa is often found growing on rocky slopes and in alpine meadows, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
