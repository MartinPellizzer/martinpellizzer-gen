    "intro": "Marumia rhodocarpa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a member of the Rutaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and unique scent. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 15 meters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly serrated margin. The flowers are small and yellowish-green, often clustered in inflorescences, and the fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds."
