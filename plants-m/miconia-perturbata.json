    "intro": "Miconia perturbata, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or *Miconia* tree, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a bright red drupe, which contains a single seed. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native flora."
