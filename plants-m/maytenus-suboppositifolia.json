It is characterized by its opposite arrangement of leaves, which are typically elliptical and have a glossy, dark green appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange-red berries that contain seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
