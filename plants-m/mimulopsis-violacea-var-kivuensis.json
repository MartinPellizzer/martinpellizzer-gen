    "intro": "Mimulopsis violacea var. kivuensis, commonly known as the Kivu violet, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Virunga Mountains in East Africa. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid climates. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of white hair. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
