    "intro": "Merkusia ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf merkusia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its evergreen shrub form with glossy, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in botanical gardens. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its natural range."
