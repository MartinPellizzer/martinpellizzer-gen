    "intro": "Medicago hispida subsp. polygyra, commonly known as hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves. It produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. This species is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, including North America. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. The plant is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a valuable forage crop and a pioneer species in ecological succession."
