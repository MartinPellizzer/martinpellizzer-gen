    "intro": "Melaleuca amboinensis, commonly known as the broad-leaved paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Australia and is characterized by its rough, flaky bark that peels away in strips. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Melaleuca amboinensis is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and sandy soils."
