    "intro": "Monotropa humilis, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a hemi-parasitic plant native to eastern North America. It lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis, relying on its host plants for nutrients. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which help it absorb nutrients from the soil. Monotropa humilis is often found in shaded, moist forest environments, where it thrives in the understory."
