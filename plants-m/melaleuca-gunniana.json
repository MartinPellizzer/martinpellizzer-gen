    "intro": "Melaleuca gunniana, commonly known as the white myrtle, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine white or greyish pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant white or cream flowers that are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. These flowers are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous small seeds. Melaleuca gunniana is often found in coastal and sandy soils, and it plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
