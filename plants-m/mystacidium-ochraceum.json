    "intro": "Mystacidium ochraceum, commonly known as the yellow lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Trapeliaceae. It is characterized by its yellowish to orange-colored thallus, which is typically crustose in growth form. The lichen is composed of a symbiotic association between a fungus and a green alga, which together form a composite organism. It is often found growing on rocks, trees, or soil in temperate and tropical regions. Due to its distinct coloration and growth habit, it is relatively easy to identify in the field."
