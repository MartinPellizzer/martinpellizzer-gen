    "intro": "Miconia cubensis var. nervulosa, commonly known as the Cuban miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba. It is characterized by its large, glossy, ovate leaves that are often veined with a distinct network of light-colored veins. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are typically followed by round, orange-red fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions, though it can become invasive in some areas."
