It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines and prominent, tuberculate ridges. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its unique appearance, with its horn-like spines, makes it a striking addition to any succulent collection. It requires well-draining soil and bright, indirect light to thrive."
