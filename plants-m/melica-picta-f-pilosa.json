    "intro": "Melica picta f. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy picta grass, is a variant of the picta grass species native to certain regions of North America. It is characterized by its finely hairy leaves and stems, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. It has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
