    "intro": "Micranthes razshivinii, commonly known as the Razshivin's micranthes, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, delicate flowers and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of white or pale yellow blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
