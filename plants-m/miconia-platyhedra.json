    "intro": "Miconia platyhedra, commonly known as the flat-leaf miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the Melastomataceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its large, broad leaves. The plant produces showy, violet-colored flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and understories. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
