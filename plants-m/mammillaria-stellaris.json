    "intro": "Mammillaria stellaris, commonly known as the star cactus, is a small, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a dense covering of white, woolly spines that give it a star-like appearance. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments. Its compact size and striking appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
