    "intro": "Malus sieversii var. pamiralaica, commonly known as the Pamir apple, is a wild apple species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a small, deciduous tree with simple, alternate leaves and white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are typically yellow or red in color, with a tart flavor. It is closely related to the domesticated apple (Malus domestica) and is considered an important genetic resource for apple breeding programs. This variety thrives in cold, high-altitude environments and is adapted to harsh, arid conditions."
