    "intro": "Micropolypodium achilleifolium, commonly known as the Achilles' leaf fern, is a small epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It features delicate, pinnate fronds with a dark green, leathery texture and a distinctive, narrow shape. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in the understory of forests. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself securely to its substrate. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
