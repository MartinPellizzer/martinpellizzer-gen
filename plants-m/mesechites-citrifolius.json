    "intro": "Mesechites citrifolius, commonly known as the citric leaf mesechites, is a rare and unique plant native to specific regions of Central America. It is characterized by its distinctive, citrus-scented leaves that emit a sharp, tangy aroma when crushed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom during the wet season, followed by the development of round, orange-hued fruits. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists due to its unusual chemical composition and limited distribution. Despite its ecological significance, it remains a poorly studied species with limited cultivation outside its native habitat."
