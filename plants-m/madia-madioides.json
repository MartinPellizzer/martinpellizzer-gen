    "intro": "Madia madioides, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations to drought and high temperatures. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, reducing water loss through transpiration. Madia madioides is often found in sandy soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
