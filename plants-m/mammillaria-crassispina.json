    "intro": "Mammillaria crassispina, commonly known as the thick-spined mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to the Mexican states of Jalisco and Nayarit. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in dense, white to pale green spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its compact size and ornamental spines, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
