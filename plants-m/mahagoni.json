    "intro": "Mahagoni, commonly known as mahogany, is a tropical hardwood tree belonging to the genus *Swietenia* in the family Meliaceae. It is native to Central and South America, as well as parts of the Caribbean. The tree is valued for its rich, reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly durable and resistant to decay. Mahogany trees can grow up to 40 meters tall and have a straight trunk with a dense, fibrous bark. Due to overharvesting, many species of mahogany are now protected, and sustainable cultivation is being promoted to conserve this valuable resource."
