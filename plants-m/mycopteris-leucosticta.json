    "intro": "Mycopteris leucosticta, commonly known as the white-veined shield fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to the humid forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a pale, contrasting midrib. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or forest floors. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous cover. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shady gardens."
