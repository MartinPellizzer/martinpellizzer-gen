    "intro": "Machaerium stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf machaerium, is a tropical perennial plant native to regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with white to pale yellow flowers, which are often accompanied by long, feathery bracts. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in savannas and forest edges. Machaerium stenophyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
