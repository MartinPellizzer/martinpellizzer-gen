    "intro": "Mimosa viperina, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold inward and droop when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimuli. The plant produces small, pale yellow to pink flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils. Mimosa viperina is also known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and runners."
