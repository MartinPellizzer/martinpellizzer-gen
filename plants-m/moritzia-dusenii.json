    "intro": "Moritzia dusenii, commonly known as the Dusen's moritzia, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, arranged in dense, spherical clusters. It thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
