    "intro": "Montia australasica, commonly known as the New Zealand watercress, is a small flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found along stream banks and in damp forest floors. Its leaves are edible and have a peppery taste similar to watercress, making it a traditional food in M\u0101ori cuisine. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
