    "intro": "Mimosa supersetosa var. rufohispidula, commonly known as the rough-hair mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems covered in dense, rusty-hairy pubescence. The leaves are bipinnate, with small, oval leaflets that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by light or touch. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or disturbed areas."
