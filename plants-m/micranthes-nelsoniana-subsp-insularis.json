    "intro": "Micranthes nelsoniana subsp. insularis, commonly known as the island micranthes, is a flowering plant native to specific island habitats in the western Pacific. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and purple. The species thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic plant species."
