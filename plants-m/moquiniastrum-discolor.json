    "intro": "Moquiniastrum discolor, commonly known as the pink marshmallow, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It features showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has soft, hairy leaves that are typically oval or lance-shaped, and it thrives in moist, sunny to partially shaded conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in wet soils. Moquiniastrum discolor is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
