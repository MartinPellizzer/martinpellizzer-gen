    "intro": "Macaranga pynaertii, commonly known as the African paper tree, is a tropical plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white waxy coating. The plant is native to regions of Africa, including countries like Nigeria and Uganda, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically clustered in inflorescences, while the fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds. The plant is valued for its lightweight, fibrous bark, which has been used traditionally for making paper and other crafts."
