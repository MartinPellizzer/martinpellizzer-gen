    "intro": "Mariscus oblonginux, commonly known as the narrowleaf marshmallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features upright, slender stems that can grow up to 60 cm in height, often covered in soft, fuzzy hair. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in loose clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are elongated, lance-shaped, and have a waxy texture, adapted to thrive in moist environments. The roots are thick and fleshy, capable of storing water, which helps the plant survive in fluctuating wetland conditions."
