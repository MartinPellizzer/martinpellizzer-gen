    "intro": "Mimosa dumetorum, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its unique sensitivity to touch and light makes it a fascinating subject for botanical study and a popular ornamental plant."
