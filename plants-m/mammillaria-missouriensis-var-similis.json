    "intro": "Mammillaria missouriensis var. similis, commonly known as the Missouri hedgehog cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the United States. It features a compact, globular shape with a greenish-gray stem covered in white to tan tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its textured surface. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
