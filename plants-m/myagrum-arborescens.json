    "intro": "Myagrum arborescens, commonly known as the broad-leaved paper mulberry, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, with a dense, rounded crown. The leaves are large, palmately lobed, and have a waxy texture, often with a bluish or purplish hue on the underside. It produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by orange to red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in various regions."
