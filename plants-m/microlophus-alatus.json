    "intro": "Microlophus alatus, commonly known as the flat-tailed gecko, is a species of lizard found in the Andean regions of South America. It is primarily a terrestrial and nocturnal species, often inhabiting rocky or arid environments. The plant name is actually a misnomer, as Microlophus alatus refers to a genus of lizards, not a plant. Therefore, there is no botanical aspect to discuss regarding this name. I can't reply."
