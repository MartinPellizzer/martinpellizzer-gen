    "intro": "Myosurus nitidus, commonly known as the glossy hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, glossy green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Myosurus nitidus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
