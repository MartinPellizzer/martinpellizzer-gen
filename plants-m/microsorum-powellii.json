    "intro": "Microsorum powellii, commonly known as the Powell's sword fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to North America. It is characterized by its long, narrow, sword-shaped fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize sediment and provide habitat for aquatic life. Microsorum powellii is often used in water gardens and pond ecosystems due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
