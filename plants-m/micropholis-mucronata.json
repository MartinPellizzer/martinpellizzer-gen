    "intro": "Micropholis mucronata, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree with smooth, dark bark and dense, glossy green leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming invasive."
