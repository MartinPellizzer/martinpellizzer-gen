    "intro": "Malvinda, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous seeds. Malvinda is often found in disturbed habitats and can become invasive in certain regions."
