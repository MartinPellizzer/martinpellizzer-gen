    "intro": "Montia sibirica var. bulbifera, commonly known as the Siberian watercress, is a herbaceous perennial native to the cold regions of Asia. It features small, alternate, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving it a frost-tender appearance. The plant produces tiny, white or green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. One of its notable botanical traits is its ability to form bulb-like structures, which help it survive harsh winter conditions. This variant is closely related to other members of the Montiaceae family, sharing similar morphological and ecological characteristics."
