    "intro": "Microchilus popayanensis, commonly known as the Popayan orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. It thrives in high-altitude cloud forests, where it relies on specific symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
