    "intro": "Macrochordion alba, commonly known as the white marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating in water, adapting to its aquatic environment. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in marshy areas. Macrochordion alba plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various insect species."
