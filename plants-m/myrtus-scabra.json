It features small, leathery leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Myrtus scabra is valued for its aromatic properties and is used in traditional medicine and as a ornamental plant."
