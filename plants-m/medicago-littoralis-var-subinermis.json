    "intro": "Medicago littoralis var. subinermis, commonly known as coastal medick, is a perennial legume native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, trifoliate leaves, and small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is often found in salt marshes and dunes. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing forage for grazing animals. Its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen makes it ecologically valuable in nutrient-poor environments."
