It is characterized by its bright yellow, orange, or red tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along streambanks and in wet meadows. It has hairy stems and oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. This variant is notable for its strong, musky fragrance, which is more pronounced in the evening."
