    "intro": "Medicago papillosa subsp. papillosa, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, cylindrical pods containing several seeds, and it is often found in disturbed soils, fields, and along roadsides. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and is used in forage and cover crops. Additionally, it is capable of nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria."
