    "intro": "Maxillaria cogniauxiana var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed maxillaria, is a species of orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of velvety hairs. The plant produces fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
