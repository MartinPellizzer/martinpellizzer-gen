It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer, often in clusters atop hairy stems. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in soft, woolly hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and partial shade."
