It typically grows in grassland habitats and has a compact, upright growth habit. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white or pale pink. Metalasia stricta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
