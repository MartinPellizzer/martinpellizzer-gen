    "intro": "Myriocarpa polystachya, commonly known as the desert thornapple, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its spiny stems and thick, waxy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by distinctive, spherical fruits that turn red when mature. Its botanical features make it well-suited for survival in harsh, dry environments, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
