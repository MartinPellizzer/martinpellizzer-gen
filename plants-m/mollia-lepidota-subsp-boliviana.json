    "intro": "Mollia lepidota subsp. boliviana, commonly known as the Bolivian star-of-Bethlehem, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Bolivia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky soils, thriving in cool and temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a glaucous coating that helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
