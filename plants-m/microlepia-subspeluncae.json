    "intro": "Microlepia subspeluncae, commonly known as the cave fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to limestone caves in Southeast Asia. It thrives in dark, humid environments with limited light, relying on bioluminescent fungi for some of its nutritional needs. The plant has finely divided, delicate fronds that are adapted to low-light conditions. It is classified as an epiphytic species, growing on rock surfaces rather than in soil. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
