    "intro": "Maeviella cochlearia, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a dense mat that helps suppress weeds. Maeviella cochlearia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
