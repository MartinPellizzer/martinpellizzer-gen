    "intro": "Melica fluitans, commonly known as floating brome, is a herbaceous plant that thrives in wetland environments. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with long, narrow leaves that float on the surface of water. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny florets. It is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of slow-moving streams. Melica fluitans plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
