    "intro": "Moutouchi draco, commonly known as the dragon's blood tree, is a unique plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its tall, tree-like structure with a thick, gnarled trunk and a crown of feathery leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy fruits containing seeds. Its sap, known as dragon's blood, is a dark red resin with historical uses in medicine and dyes. The tree thrives in dry, arid environments and is well-adapted to survive with minimal water."
