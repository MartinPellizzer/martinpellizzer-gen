    "intro": "Melaleuca hakeifolia var. brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bottlebrush, is a shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and distinctive cylindrical flower spikes that range in color from red to pink. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments. The varietal form brevifolia is distinguished by its shorter, more compact leaves compared to the typical species."
