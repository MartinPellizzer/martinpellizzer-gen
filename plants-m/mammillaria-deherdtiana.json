    "intro": "Mammillaria deherdtiana, commonly known as the Deherdt's mammillaria, is a compact cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular stem with prominent, white to yellowish tubercles that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
