It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows, stream banks, and forest edges. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often covered with fine, hair-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly rough texture. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers."
