    "intro": "Microchilus siberianus, commonly known as the Siberian bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the cold climates of eastern Siberia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has slender, hairy stems and produces small, oval leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in well-drained, loamy soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability to harsh environments, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler regions."
