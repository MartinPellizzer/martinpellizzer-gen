    "intro": "Mortonia scaberrima, commonly known as the roughleaf mortonia, is a perennial shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and oval, rough-textured leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by distinctive, spherical fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
