    "intro": "Myoxanthus exasperatus, commonly known as the roughleaf myoxanthus, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Acanthaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, and its leaves are rough to the touch, giving it its common name. It has fibrous roots and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
