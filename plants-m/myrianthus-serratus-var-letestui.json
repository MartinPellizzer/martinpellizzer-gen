    "intro": "Myrianthus serratus var. letestui, commonly known as the African flame tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are deeply lobed and often have serrated edges. The plant produces showy, orange-red flowers arranged in panicles, which bloom during the wet season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in warm climates for its vibrant floral display."
