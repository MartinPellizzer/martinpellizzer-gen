    "intro": "Myriophyllum verticillatum var. cheneyi, commonly known as Cheney's watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to North America. It has whorled leaves that are typically narrow and elongated, with a smooth or slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often floating at the water's surface. It thrives in freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. Its rapid growth can make it a significant aquatic weed in certain ecosystems."
