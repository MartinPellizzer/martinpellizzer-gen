    "intro": "Macrozamia serpentina, commonly known as the Serpentine Cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its limited distribution and threats from habitat loss, Macrozamia serpentina is considered a vulnerable species."
