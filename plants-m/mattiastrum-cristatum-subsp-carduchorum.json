    "intro": "Mattiastrum cristatum subsp. carduchorum, commonly known as the mountain starflower, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine habitats."
