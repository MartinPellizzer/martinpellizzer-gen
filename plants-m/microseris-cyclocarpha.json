    "intro": "Microseris cyclocarpha, commonly known as the round-fruit biscuitroot, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many mustard plants. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers arranged in a compact cluster, and its fruits are spherical and covered in a rough, hairy texture. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush habitats. The species is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments."
