    "intro": "Marina diffusa, commonly known as the coastal rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing, succulent stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and strong winds. Its leaves are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Marina diffusa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
