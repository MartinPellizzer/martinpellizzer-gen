    "intro": "Misanteca limbosa, commonly known as the golden mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble clusters of small flowers. The plant features showy yellow to orange ray flowers surrounding a central disk of smaller florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stems. Misanteca limbosa is often found in moist, shaded habitats, such as forest understories and stream banks."
