    "intro": "Malpigiantha, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Malpigiantha is often found in disturbed habitats and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
