    "intro": "Mimosa biglobosa, commonly known as the giant sensitive plant, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are followed by elongated seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Mimosa biglobosa is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important plant in certain ecological contexts."
