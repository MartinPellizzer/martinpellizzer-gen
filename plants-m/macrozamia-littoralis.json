    "intro": "Macrozamia littoralis, commonly known as the coastal cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Macrozamia littoralis is adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
