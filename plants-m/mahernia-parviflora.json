It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows as a shrub or perennial herb, featuring narrow, gray-green leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers. Mahernia parviflora is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. Its botanical features make it of interest to botanists and horticulturists studying drought-tolerant flora."
