    "intro": "Morella cacuminis, commonly known as the sweet fern, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its unique, fern-like foliage that turns a striking rusty red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are wind-pollinated, followed by woody, cone-like structures containing samaras. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Morella cacuminis plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
