    "intro": "Mikania violascens, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the morning, hence its common name. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a velvety texture. Mikania violascens is native to the Americas and is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and forest edges."
