    "intro": "Mariscus hermaphroditus, commonly known as the common mariscus, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in moist, calcareous soils along streambanks and wet meadows. The plant is characterized by its umbellate inflorescence, which consists of small white or greenish flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a distinctive, feathery appearance. Mariscus hermaphroditus is primarily a herbaceous perennial, though it may occasionally exhibit semi-woody growth in certain conditions."
