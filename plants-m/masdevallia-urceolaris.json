    "intro": "Masdevallia urceolaris, commonly known as the urn-shaped masdevallia, is a tropical orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, urn-shaped flower spike that bears several small, delicate flowers with a distinctive coloration. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark in its natural habitat. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve moisture. The species is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its striking appearance and relatively compact size."
