    "intro": "Micromyrtus imbricata, commonly known as the coastal paperbark, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. It produces small, yellowish flowers in spring, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. This species is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
