    "intro": "Mapania unimasiana, commonly known as the Bornean star orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that display a vibrant mix of purple and white hues. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in the canopy layer of the forest. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, adapting to the humid and nutrient-poor conditions of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
