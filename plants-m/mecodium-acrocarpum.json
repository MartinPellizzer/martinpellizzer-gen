    "intro": "Mecodium acrocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mecodium, is a small annual herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant has slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in clusters, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
