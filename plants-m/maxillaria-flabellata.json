    "intro": "Maxillaria flabellata, commonly known as the Flabellate Orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The flowers have a distinctive flabellate (fan-like) shape, which gives the plant its common name. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Maxillaria flabellata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a suitable growing environment."
