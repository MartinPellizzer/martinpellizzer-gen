    "intro": "Montbretia \u00d7 crocosmiiflora sulfurea, commonly known as the golden montbretia, is a hybrid ornamental plant belonging to the Iridaceae family. It is characterized by its striking, bright yellow flowers with a distinctive orange center, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant features strap-shaped, grass-like leaves that are dark green and often have a reddish tint along the edges. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often classified as a noxious weed."
