    "intro": "Microula roseiflora, commonly known as the rose-flowered microula, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit. The plant produces small, pinkish to reddish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Microula roseiflora is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions."
