    "intro": "Miconia heteroneura, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of short, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by distinctive, winged fruits. Miconia heteroneura is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, making it an invasive species in some regions. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a challenge for land managers."
