    "intro": "Mapania stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping marshplant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread horizontally through stolons, forming dense mats. The plant typically has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its ability to colonize wet areas makes it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems."
