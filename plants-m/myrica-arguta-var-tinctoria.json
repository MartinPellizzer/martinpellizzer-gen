    "intro": "Myrica arguta var. tinctoria, commonly known as the red cedar or mountain sumac, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and red, fuzzy fruits that persist through winter. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its leaves are alternate, oval, and have a slightly serrated edge. The species is notable for its historical use in dye production, as the berries were once used to create red dyes."
