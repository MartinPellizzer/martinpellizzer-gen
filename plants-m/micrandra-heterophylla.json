    "intro": "Micrandra heterophylla, commonly known as the variable-leaf micrandra, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its diverse leaf morphology, with leaves varying in shape, size, and texture depending on environmental conditions. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to salt spray and coastal winds. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers appear in clusters and are often visited by native bees and other pollinators. Micrandra heterophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens."
