    "intro": "Machaerium lilacinum, commonly known as the purple machaerium, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, often sparsely branched stems. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in dense, globular clusters. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a fibrous root system. Machaerium lilacinum is often found in open woodland and savanna habitats, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
