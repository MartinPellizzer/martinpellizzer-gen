    "intro": "Melia pendula, commonly known as the weeping chinquapin, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive pendulous branches that droop gracefully, giving it a weeping appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by spiny, spherical fruits. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin. Melia pendula is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical use in traditional medicine."
