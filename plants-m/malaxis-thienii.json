It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its roots are fibrous, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The flowers are small, with three sepals and three petals, and are often arranged in a spike."
