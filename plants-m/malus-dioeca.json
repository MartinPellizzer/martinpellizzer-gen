    "intro": "Malus dioeca, commonly known as the sand apple or wild crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and features alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers in the spring, followed by edible, apple-like fruits that are yellow or orange when ripe. The fruits are often consumed by birds and small mammals, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, rocky environments."
