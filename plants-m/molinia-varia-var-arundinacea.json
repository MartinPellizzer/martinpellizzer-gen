    "intro": "Molinia varia var. arundinacea, commonly known as the woolly moorgrass, is a perennial grass species native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous foliage that often forms clumps. The plant produces spikelets that are typically pale green to brown, with bracts that are often hairy or woolly in appearance. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wet meadows, bogs, and marshy areas. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with wet or boggy conditions."
