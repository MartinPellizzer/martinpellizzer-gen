    "intro": "Malus domestica var. praecox, commonly known as early apple, is a variety of domestic apple that matures earlier than most other apple cultivars. It is characterized by its smaller fruit size and typically reddish or yellowish skin, which can vary depending on the specific cultivar. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges and displays a moderate growth habit. It is well-suited for cooler climates and is often cultivated for its early harvest and good flavor. This variety is valued in both commercial orchards and home gardens for its adaptability and productivity."
