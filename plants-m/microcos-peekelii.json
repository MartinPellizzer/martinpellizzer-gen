    "intro": "Microcos peekelii, commonly known as the Mexican dwarf mallow, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10-15 centimeters and produces yellow stamens and a red or purple pistil. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for xeriscaping in drought-prone areas. Microcos peekelii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
