    "intro": "Mesochloa canaliculata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ironwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the cooler months. Its wood is hard and dense, making it valuable for traditional uses and craftsmanship. Mesochloa canaliculata is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
