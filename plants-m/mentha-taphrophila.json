    "intro": "Mentha taphrophila, commonly known as the grave weed or cemetery mint, is a rare and elusive plant belonging to the mint family (Lamiaceae). It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and delicate, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. This species is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland floors and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly through underground stems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Mentha taphrophila is considered a rare and endangered plant in many regions."
