    "intro": "Mendoncia costaricana, commonly known as the Costa Rican mendoncia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Costa Rica. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often accompanied by opposite leaves with serrated edges. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
