It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically a deep blue or violet color. The plant produces a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Mertensia tibetica is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
