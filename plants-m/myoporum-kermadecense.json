    "intro": "Myoporum kermadecense, commonly known as the Kermadec myoporum, is a flowering plant native to the Kermadec Islands in the South Pacific. It is a small shrub that typically grows in coastal environments, thriving in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slight waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Myoporum kermadecense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with a subtropical climate."
