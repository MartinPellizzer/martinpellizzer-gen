    "intro": "Microtis viridis, commonly known as the green microtis, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, which includes orchids, and is characterized by its unique, grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Microtis viridis is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological study."
