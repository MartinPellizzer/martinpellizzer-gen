It is a variant of Mentha litoralis, characterized by its interrupted or irregular leaf patterns, which distinguish it from the typical form. This plant exhibits aromatic leaves and often grows in rocky or sandy soils along the coastline. Its morphology includes narrow, serrated leaves and small, pale blue or purple flowers. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
