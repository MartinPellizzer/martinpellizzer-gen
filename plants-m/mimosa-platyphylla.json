    "intro": "Mimosa platyphylla, commonly known as the flat-leaf mimosa, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are typically arranged in a flat, fan-like pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often in response to touch or temperature changes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or swampy areas. Mimosa platyphylla is also known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets."
