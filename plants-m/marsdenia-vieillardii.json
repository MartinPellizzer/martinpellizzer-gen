    "intro": "Marsdenia vieillardii, commonly known as the Vieillard's Marsdenia, is a climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and opposite, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by follicles containing numerous seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, often growing in shaded, moist habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in horticulture, though it remains relatively uncommon in cultivation."
