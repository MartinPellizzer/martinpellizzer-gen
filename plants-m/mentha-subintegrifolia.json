    "intro": "Mentha subintegrifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mint, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in whorled clusters, typically in late summer. Mentha subintegrifolia is closely related to other mint species and shares similar aromatic properties, though its fragrance is often more subtle. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow environments."
