    "intro": "Malaxis cirrhiflora, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its roots are fibrous, and it has a rhizome that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. The orchid's morphology reflects its adaptation to low-light conditions, with narrow leaves and a compact growth habit."
