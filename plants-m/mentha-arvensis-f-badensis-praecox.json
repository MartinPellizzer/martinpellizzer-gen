    "intro": "Mentha arvensis f. badensis-praecox, commonly known as early field mint, is a subspecies of the broad-leaf mint. It is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring. This plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a strong menthol scent, which contributes to its use in herbal remedies. The subspecies is notable for its early flowering habit compared to other forms of Mentha arvensis."
