It is a small evergreen tree characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and fragrant, aromatic fruits. The plant produces a unique fruit with a thick, woody outer layer enclosing a single seed, which is often used in traditional medicine. Myristica leptophylla is valued for its essential oils and has been used in various cultural and medicinal practices. However, it is considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss and overharvesting."
