    "intro": "Macrochloa antiatlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic grass, is a unique plant species native to the coastal regions of western Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Its flowering spikes produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow. Due to its specialized habitat, Macrochloa antiatlantica is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
