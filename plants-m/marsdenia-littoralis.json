    "intro": "Marsdenia littoralis, commonly known as the coastal Marsdenia, is a climbing plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by elliptical, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found near the coast where it can climb trees or shrubs. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive."
