    "intro": "Mimosa xanthocentra subsp. subsericea, commonly known as the silky mimosa, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the dry season. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a garden plant in warmer climates."
