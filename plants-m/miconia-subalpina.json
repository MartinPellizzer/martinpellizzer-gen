    "intro": "Miconia subalpina, commonly known as the alpine miconia, is a shrub native to the Andean highlands of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and summer months. Its fruit is a bright red, fleshy berry that contains several seeds. Miconia subalpina thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests at elevations above 2,500 meters."
