    "intro": "Malaxis melanophylla, commonly known as the black-leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and slender, erect stems that bear clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found in the undergrowth of tropical rainforests. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
