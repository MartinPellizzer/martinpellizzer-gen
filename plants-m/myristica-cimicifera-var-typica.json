It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, woody bark and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries containing the seeds used for nutmeg and mace. Its essential oils, rich in compounds like myristicin and elemicin, contribute to its distinctive fragrance and medicinal properties. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, fertile soil for optimal growth."
