    "intro": "Mimosa soratensis, commonly known as the silky mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and showy, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. It has a shallow root system and is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed soils. Mimosa soratensis is also noted for its sensitive leaves, which fold shut when touched, a trait shared with other species in the Mimosa genus."
