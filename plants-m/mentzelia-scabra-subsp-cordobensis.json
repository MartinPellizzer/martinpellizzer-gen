It belongs to the family Loasaceae and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as sandy soils and rocky areas. It has a hairy texture on its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
