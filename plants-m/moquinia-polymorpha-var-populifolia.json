    "intro": "Moquinia polymorpha var. populifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features slender, upright stems that often form dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and have a distinctive waxy coating that aids in water retention. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in spike-like inflorescences and bloom in late summer. This variety is adapted to saturated soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
