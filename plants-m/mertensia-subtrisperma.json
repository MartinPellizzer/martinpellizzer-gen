    "intro": "Mertensia subtrisperma, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bluebell, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, sky-blue flowers in early spring, which are characteristic of the genus Mertensia. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for woodland gardens and naturalized landscapes."
