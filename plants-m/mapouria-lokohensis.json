    "intro": "Mapouria lokohensis, commonly known as the Cameroon ebony, is a small evergreen tree native to the rainforests of western Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dark, dense wood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, red fruits containing one or two seeds. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
