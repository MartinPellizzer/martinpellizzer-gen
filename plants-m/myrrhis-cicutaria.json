    "intro": "Myrrhis cicutaria, commonly known as the meadow parsnip, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Myrrhis cicutaria grows in moist meadows and along stream banks, often forming dense colonies. It is notable for its strong, sometimes unpleasant odor, which can be a deterrent to herbivores."
