    "intro": "Maerua campicola, commonly known as the coastal maerua, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces small yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It is well-suited to sandy or gravelly soils and can tolerate drought conditions. Maerua campicola plays a role in stabilizing coastal and dune ecosystems."
