It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to orange with intricate patterns, making it a sought-after specimen among orchid enthusiasts.
