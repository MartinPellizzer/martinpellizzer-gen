    "intro": "Mastigostyla torotoroensis, commonly known as the Torotoro grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high Andean regions of Bolivia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of the Andean altitude. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
