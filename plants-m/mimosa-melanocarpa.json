    "intro": "Mimosa melanocarpa, commonly known as the black mimosa, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaflets. The plant produces small, fluffy yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive pod-like fruits that turn black as they mature. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to local wildlife."
