    "intro": "Mimosa tortilis, commonly known as the weeping mimosa, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its feathery, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by light or touch. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the spring and summer seasons. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and sandy soils."
