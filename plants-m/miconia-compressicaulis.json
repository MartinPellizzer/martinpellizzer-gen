    "intro": "Miconia compressicaulis, commonly known as the broadleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
