    "intro": "Microtoena insuavis, commonly known as the bitter microtoena, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, pale green leaves and tiny, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Its scientific name reflects its unpleasant taste, which is a notable trait for both its foliage and flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
