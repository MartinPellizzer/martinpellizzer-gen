    "intro": "Microlepia herbacea, commonly known as the common microlepia, is a terrestrial fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Microlepia herbacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage."
