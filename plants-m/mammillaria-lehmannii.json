    "intro": "Mammillaria lehmannii, commonly known as the Lehmann's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its globular shape and dense covering of spines, which provide protection from herbivores and harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid climates. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
