    "intro": "Micromeria xylorrhiza, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its small, showy flowers. The plant has adapted to harsh desert conditions with a compact growth form, reduced leaf surface area, and deep root systems to access water. Its flowers are typically pink or purple and bloom in late spring to early summer. Micromeria xylorrhiza plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
