    "intro": "Modecca peltata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or yellow in color. Modecca peltata is often found in wetlands and disturbed soils, thriving in humid environments. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes make it an invasive species in some areas."
