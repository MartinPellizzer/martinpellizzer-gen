    "intro": "Mimosa pedunculosa, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its roots can form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility. Mimosa pedunculosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
