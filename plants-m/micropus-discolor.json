    "intro": "Micropus discolor, commonly known as the yellow bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features showy yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
