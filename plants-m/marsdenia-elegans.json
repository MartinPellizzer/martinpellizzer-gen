    "intro": "Marsdenia elegans, commonly known as the elegant Marsdenia, is a climbing plant belonging to the Asclepiadaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which are followed by follicles containing seeds with tufts of silky hair. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
