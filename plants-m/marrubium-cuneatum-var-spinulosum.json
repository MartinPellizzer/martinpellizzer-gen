    "intro": "Marrubium cuneatum var. spinulosum, commonly known as the spiny hartswart, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in small, stiff bristles. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance gardening."
