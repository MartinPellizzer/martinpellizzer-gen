    "intro": "Microglossa zeylanica var. beddomei, commonly known as the Beddome's microglossa, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the tropical regions of South and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
