    "intro": "Maxillaria lutheri, commonly known as the Luther's orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America. It is a sympodial epiphyte, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it typically thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with intricate patterns. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in its natural habitat. Maxillaria lutheri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
