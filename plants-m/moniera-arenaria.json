    "intro": "Moniera arenaria, commonly known as sandgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and coastal environments. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh, windy conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. Moniera arenaria thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or along shorelines. Its ability to stabilize sand dunes makes it an important species in coastal ecosystems."
