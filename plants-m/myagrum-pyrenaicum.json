It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes other aromatic plants such as eucalyptus and clove. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. Its bark is smooth and grey, and it produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Myagrum pyrenaicum is often found in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in temperate climates."
