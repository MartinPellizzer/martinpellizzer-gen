    "intro": "Melampyrum pratense f. umbrosum, commonly known as shadow lousewort, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and meadows, preferring partial to full shade. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a slightly hairy surface, and it produces capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. This form is distinguished by its darker, more subdued flower color compared to the typical form of Melampyrum pratense."
