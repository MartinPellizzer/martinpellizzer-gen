These shrubs are native to eastern North America and are characterized by their small, bell-shaped flowers and evergreen or deciduous foliage. Menziesia species typically grow in acidic, well-drained soils and are often found in forested areas. They produce small, dark berries that are an important food source for various wildlife. The genus includes several species, such as Menziesia torreyi and Menziesia melissifolia, which are valued for their ornamental and ecological significance."
