    "intro": "Malaxis hispaniolae, commonly known as the Hispaniola orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a raceme, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
