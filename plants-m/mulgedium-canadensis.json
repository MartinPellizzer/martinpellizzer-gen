    "intro": "Mulgedium canadensis, commonly known as Canada mulgedium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its small, greenish-white flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Mulgedium canadensis plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and wildlife."
