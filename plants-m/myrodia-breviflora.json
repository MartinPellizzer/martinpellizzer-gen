    "intro": "Myrodia breviflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved myrtle, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow, and often gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves contain volatile oils, which contribute to its strong, distinctive scent. Myrodia breviflora is well adapted to coastal environments, with a high tolerance for salt spray and sandy soils."
