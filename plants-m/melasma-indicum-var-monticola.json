    "intro": "Melasma indicum var. monticola, commonly known as the mountain melasma, is a variant of the melasma plant native to high-altitude regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, leathery foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the melasma genus."
