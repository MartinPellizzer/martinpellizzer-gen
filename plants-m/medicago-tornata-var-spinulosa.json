    "intro": "Medicago tornata var. spinulosa, commonly known as the prickly medick, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and distinctive, spiny pods that contain lens-shaped seeds. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. The plant's adaptability and hardy nature make it a common weed in agricultural settings."
