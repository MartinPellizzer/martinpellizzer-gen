    "intro": "Malania oleifera, commonly known as the oil palm, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves and tall, straight trunk that can grow up to 20 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of fruit that contain oil-rich seeds, making it economically important for palm oil production. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a sympodial growth pattern. Malania oleifera thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil."
