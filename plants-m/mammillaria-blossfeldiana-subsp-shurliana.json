It features a globular to cylindrical shape with closely spaced, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a gray-green body covered in small, white tubercles and is well-suited for rock gardens or container cultivation. It requires full sun and well-draining soil to thrive, making it a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts. Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
