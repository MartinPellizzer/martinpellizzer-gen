    "intro": "Monstera spruceana, commonly known as the Swiss cheese plant, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that develop fenestrations, or holes, as they mature. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and requires indirect sunlight for optimal growth. Its stems can climb or trail, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets or vertical gardens. The leaves are typically a deep green with a slightly glossy surface, adding a striking visual element to any space."
