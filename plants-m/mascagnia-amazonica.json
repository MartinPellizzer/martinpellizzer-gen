    "intro": "Mascagnia amazonica, commonly known as the Amazonian trumpet vine, is a climbing plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its striking orange-yellow flowers, which resemble trumpets and bloom during the rainy season. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces small, red berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
