    "intro": "Medicago orbicularis var. catholica, commonly known as the European goat's rue, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as roadsides and wastelands. It has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor soils. Its seeds are encased in a distinctive, spiny pod, which aids in seed dispersal."
