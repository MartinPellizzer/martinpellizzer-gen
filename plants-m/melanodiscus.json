    "intro": "Melanodiscus, commonly known as the black-eyed Susan, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow to orange flower heads with a dark central disk, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in a variety of habitats, including grasslands and disturbed soils, and is native to parts of Africa, Asia, and Australia. Melanodiscus species are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their showy blooms and ease of care. The leaves are usually lance-shaped and hairy, providing a textured contrast to the bright flowers."
