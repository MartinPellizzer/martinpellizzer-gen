    "intro": "Mimosa erinacea, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous annual plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a common sight in disturbed areas and gardens. Due to its unique sensitivity and rapid growth, it is often used in educational settings to demonstrate plant responses to environmental stimuli."
