It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, flat seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain environments."
