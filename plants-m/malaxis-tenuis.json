    "intro": "Malaxis tenuis, commonly known as the slender malaxis, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant has a slender, creeping rhizome and produces linear, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
