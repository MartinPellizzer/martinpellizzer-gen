    "intro": "Myrmechis chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to China.

The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions.
