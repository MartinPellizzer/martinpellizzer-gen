    "intro": "Monactineirma coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved monactine, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. Its bark is thick and leathery, providing structural support and protection against herbivores. Monactineirma coriacea is well adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and extreme temperature fluctuations."
