It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that are followed by woody, cone-like fruits. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in areas with moderate rainfall. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
