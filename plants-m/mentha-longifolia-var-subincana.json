It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green leaves and small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a strong, aromatic scent due to the presence of menthol and other volatile oils. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. This variety is often used in herbal remedies and as a ornamental plant in gardens."
