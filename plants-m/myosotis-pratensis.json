It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and along stream banks, thriving in well-drained soil. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces seed capsules that release tiny seeds when mature. Myosotis pratensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
