It features heart-shaped, trifoliate leaves and produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple. The plant is characterized by its vigorous growth habit and ability to climb or trail along the ground. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed areas. Due to its rapid spread, it can become invasive in certain regions."
