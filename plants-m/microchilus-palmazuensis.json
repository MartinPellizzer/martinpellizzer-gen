It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its unique, palm-like appearance. The plant features a slender trunk and broad, fan-shaped leaves that give it a distinctive visual appeal. Its botanical significance lies in its limited distribution and potential ecological role in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
