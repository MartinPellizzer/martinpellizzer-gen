It produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. The plant has a fibrous root system and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water in arid conditions. It is often found in open grasslands and alpine meadows, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
