It is characterized by its aromatic, slightly lemon-scented leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rocky or gravelly habitats. Its leaves are often used in herbal teas and traditional medicine for their calming properties. Melissa montana is also valued for its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
