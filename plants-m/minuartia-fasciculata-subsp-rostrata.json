    "intro": "Minuartia fasciculata subsp. rostrata, commonly known as the rostrated sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are linear and often clustered at the base, forming dense, cushion-like structures. This subspecies is notable for its ability to survive in harsh environments due to its frost-resistant properties and efficient water retention."
