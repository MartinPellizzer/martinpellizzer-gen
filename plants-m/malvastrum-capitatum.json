    "intro": "Malvastrum capitatum, commonly known as the yellow star-thistle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny stems and distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a basal rosette of leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and its inflorescence is a dense cluster of small, star-shaped flowers. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in fields and along roadsides. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native range."
