    "intro": "Marcgravia parviflora var. pedunculosa, commonly known as the small-flowered climbing gesneriad, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences at the ends of its stems. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouses."
