    "intro": "Mentha aquatica f. solida, commonly known as solid mentha or solid water mint, is a frost-tender perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a subspecies of Mentha aquatica, characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller, more solid leaves compared to the typical form. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland edges. It produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in whorls along the stems. The leaves are aromatic and can be used in culinary or medicinal applications, though it is less commonly cultivated than other mint species."
