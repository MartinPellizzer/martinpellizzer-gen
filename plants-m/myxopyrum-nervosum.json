    "intro": "Myxopyrum nervosum, commonly known as the common marsh grass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, wet meadows, and along the edges of ponds. Myxopyrum nervosum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
