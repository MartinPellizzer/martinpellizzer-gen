    "intro": "Megastachya thalassica, commonly known as the sea spike, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has fibrous roots and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salty, windy environments. Megastachya thalassica is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
