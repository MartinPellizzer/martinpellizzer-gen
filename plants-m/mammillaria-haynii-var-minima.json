    "intro": "Mammillaria haynii var. minima, commonly known as the miniature mammillaria, is a small, slow-growing cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular to cylindrical stem with white to pale green spines and a dense covering of white glochids. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, spherical fruits. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright light with minimal water. Due to its compact size and ornamental appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
