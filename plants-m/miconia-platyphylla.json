    "intro": "Miconia platyphylla, commonly known as the broad-leaf miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by orange-red berries. It is often found in moist, shaded forest understories and thrives in humid climates. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, it is considered an invasive species in some regions."
