    "intro": "Microstylis oculata, commonly known as the eye-shaped grass, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, grass-like leaves and distinctive, eye-like structures on its inflorescence. The plant typically grows in wetlands and moist soils, thriving in environments with high humidity. Its flowers are clustered in dense spikes, and the plant produces small, wind-pollinated blooms. Microstylis oculata is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
