    "intro": "Meionectes, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant has no leaves and relies entirely on its roots for photosynthesis, which are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, with a unique, ghost-like appearance that gives it its common name. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Meionectes is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many areas."
