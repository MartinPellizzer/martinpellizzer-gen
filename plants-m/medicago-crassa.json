    "intro": "Medicago crassa, commonly known as broadleaf medick, is a perennial legume native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a deep root system, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. It is often found in grasslands, disturbed sites, and along roadsides. Medicago crassa is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration and agricultural settings."
