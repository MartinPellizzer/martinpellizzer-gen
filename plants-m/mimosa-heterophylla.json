    "intro": "Mimosa heterophylla, commonly known as the variable mimosa, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive bipinnate leaves that vary in shape and size depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Mimosa heterophylla is also known for its sensitive leaves that fold when touched, a trait shared with other species in the Mimosa genus."
