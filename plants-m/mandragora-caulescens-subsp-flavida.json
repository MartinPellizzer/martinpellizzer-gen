    "intro": "Mandragora caulescens subsp. flavida, commonly known as the yellow-flowered mandrake, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its distinctive, often bi-lobed leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces toxic berries that contain tropane alkaloids, which have historically been used in folk medicine and witchcraft. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its toxic properties, it requires careful handling and is considered a protected species in some regions."
