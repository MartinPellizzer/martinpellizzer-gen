It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a reddish or purplish underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. Miconia cornoides is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and along stream banks. It is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
