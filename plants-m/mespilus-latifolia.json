    "intro": "Mespilus latifolia, commonly known as the white medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in early spring. The fruit, which is a pome, ripens in autumn and has a unique, complex flavor when fully mature. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its historical use in traditional medicine. It also plays a role in supporting local wildlife, particularly insects and birds."
