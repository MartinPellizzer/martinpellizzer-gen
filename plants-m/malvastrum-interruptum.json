    "intro": "Malvastrum interruptum, commonly known as the common mallow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features hairy, lobed leaves and produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecological diversity. The plant's fibrous roots and mucilaginous seeds have historically been used in traditional herbal medicine."
