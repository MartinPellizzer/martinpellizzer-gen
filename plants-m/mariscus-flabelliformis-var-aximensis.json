    "intro": "Mariscus flabelliformis var. aximensis, commonly known as the Axim bellflower, is a rare and unique plant native to the tropical rainforests of West Africa. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species in its native range."
