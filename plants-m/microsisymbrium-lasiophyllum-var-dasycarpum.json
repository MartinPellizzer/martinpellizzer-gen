    "intro": "Microsisymbrium lasiophyllum var. dasycarpum, commonly known as the woolly root vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in fine, soft pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by small, hairy pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
