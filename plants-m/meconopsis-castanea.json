It features striking, helmet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple, with a distinctive yellow marking on the upper lip. The plant has dark green, palmately lobed leaves that are velvety to the touch. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and is also used in traditional medicine."
