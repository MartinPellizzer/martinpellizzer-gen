    "intro": "Miconia borinquensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the island of Puerto Rico. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange-red berries that contain several seeds. Miconia borinquensis is often found in moist, shaded areas of the forest understory, where it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
