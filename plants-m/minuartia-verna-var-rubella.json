    "intro": "Minuartia verna var. rubella, commonly known as the pink rockcress, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to alpine and rocky habitats. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in early spring. The plant has hairy, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. It is often found in mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to cold, nutrient-poor soils."
