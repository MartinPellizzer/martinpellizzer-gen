It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet cluster, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers.
