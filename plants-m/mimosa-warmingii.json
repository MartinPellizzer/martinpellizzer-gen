    "intro": "Mimosa warmingii, commonly known as the Mexican mimosa, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellow to pinkish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are sensitive to touch, folding shut when disturbed, a trait known as thigmonastic response. Mimosa warmingii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its elegant appearance and adaptability to various soil types."
