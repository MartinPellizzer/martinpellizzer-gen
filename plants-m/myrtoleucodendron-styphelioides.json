    "intro": "Myrtoleucodendron styphelioides, commonly known as the New Zealand mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and typically grows on the branches of native trees such as kahikatea and rimu. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces white or pink flowers that are pollinated by insects. Its berries are red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Myrtoleucodendron styphelioides plays a role in the ecological dynamics of New Zealand's forests, though it can sometimes cause stress to its host plants."
