    "intro": "Meconopsis speciosa subsp. speciosa, commonly known as the Himalayan blue poppy, is a striking alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Nepal, Bhutan, and China. It is characterized by its vibrant blue to violet petals, which are typically 5\u20137 cm in length, and its palmate leaves that are deeply lobed. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, often growing in rocky soils and among grasslands. It produces a single flower per stem, which blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to its ornamental value and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
