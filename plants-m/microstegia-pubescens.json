    "intro": "Microstegia pubescens, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces small, delicate spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Microstegia pubescens thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its hairy texture and unique foliage make it a notable species in botanical studies."
