    "intro": "Miconia mandonii, commonly known as the giant miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, three-lobed fruits. Miconia mandonii is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions. Its botanical features make it a notable plant in ecological and horticultural studies."
