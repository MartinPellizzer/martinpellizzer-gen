    "intro": "Mischocarpus cauliflorus, commonly known as the Brazilian walnut or copaiba, is a tropical tree native to South America. It is characterized by its cauliflorous flowering habit, where flowers and fruits develop directly on the trunk and branches. The plant produces large, woody fruits that contain a single seed, and its leaves are typically alternate and ovate. It is valued for its aromatic resin, which has been used traditionally for medicinal and commercial purposes. The tree plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, supporting diverse wildlife and contributing to forest biodiversity."
