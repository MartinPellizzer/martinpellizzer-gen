    "intro": "Millettia hylobia, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its dense, reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its strength and aesthetic qualities. The plant has compound leaves with long, slender leaflets and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its fruit is a pod containing several seeds, and the plant is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to overharvesting, Millettia hylobia is considered endangered in many regions."
