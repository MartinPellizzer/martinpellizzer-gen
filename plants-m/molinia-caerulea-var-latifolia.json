    "intro": "Molinia caerulea var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved moor grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wet meadows, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is notable for its ecological importance, providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
