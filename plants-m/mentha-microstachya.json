    "intro": "Mentha microstachya, commonly known as narrow-leaved mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves that are typically less than 2 cm in length. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in whorls along the stem, which bloom in late summer. Mentha microstachya is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its essential oils contain menthol and other compounds that contribute to its distinctive minty aroma."
