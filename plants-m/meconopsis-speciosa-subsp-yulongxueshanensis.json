    "intro": "Meconopsis speciosa subsp. yulongxueshanensis, commonly known as the Yulong Snow Mountain meconopsis, is a rare and striking alpine plant native to the Yulong Xueshan mountain range in Yunnan, China. It is characterized by its large, showy blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in high-altitude meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are broad and lobed, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
