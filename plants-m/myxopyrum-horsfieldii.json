    "intro": "Myxopyrum horsfieldii, commonly known as the Horsfield's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
