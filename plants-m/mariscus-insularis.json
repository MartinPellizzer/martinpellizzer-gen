    "intro": "Mariscus insularis, commonly known as the island mariscus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, hairy stems and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Mariscus insularis is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
