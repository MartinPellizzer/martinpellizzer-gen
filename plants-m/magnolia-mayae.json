It is characterized by its large, showy white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. Its bark is smooth and gray, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Magnolia mayae is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
