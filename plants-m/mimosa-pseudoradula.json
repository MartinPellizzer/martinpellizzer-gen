    "intro": "Mimosa pseudoradula, commonly known as the red mimosa, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its leaves are sensitive to touch, curling when disturbed, a trait shared with other members of the Mimosa genus. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
