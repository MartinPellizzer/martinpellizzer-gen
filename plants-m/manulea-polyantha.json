    "intro": "Manulea polyantha, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Manulea polyantha is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
