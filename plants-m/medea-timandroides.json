    "intro": "Medea timandroides, commonly known as the purple-spined milkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking violet or purple spines along the stems and leaves, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. Its milkweed sap contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to many animals. Medea timandroides plays a role in supporting local ecosystems, particularly for certain species of butterflies and insects."
