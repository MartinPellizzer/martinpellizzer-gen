It is a small, globular cactus with a distinctive yellowish-green body covered in white to pale green spines. The plant features short, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are reduced to tubercles, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
