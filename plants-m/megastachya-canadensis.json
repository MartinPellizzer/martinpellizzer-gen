It is a perennial herb characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slightly rough texture. The flowers, which are usually greenish or brownish, are arranged in spikes and are wind-pollinated."
