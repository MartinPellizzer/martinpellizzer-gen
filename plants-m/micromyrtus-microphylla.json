    "intro": "Micromyrtus microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, glossy, dark green leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces tiny, fragrant white flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves and flowers are often used in traditional Aboriginal medicine for their aromatic and potentially therapeutic properties. Micromyrtus microphylla is well adapted to salty coastal environments and is often found growing in sandy soils along the shoreline."
