    "intro": "Moorea quila, commonly known as the Moorea starling or Moorea starfruit, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the island of Moorea in French Polynesia. It is characterized by its dense, sparsely leafed structure and produces small, yellow-orange fruits that are edible. The plant thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a glossy surface, and the flowers are small and inconspicuous. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Moorea quila is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
