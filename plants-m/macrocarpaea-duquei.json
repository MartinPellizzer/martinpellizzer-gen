    "intro": "Macrocarpaea duquei, commonly known as the Duque's macrocarpaea, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, while its flowers are clustered in umbels. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
