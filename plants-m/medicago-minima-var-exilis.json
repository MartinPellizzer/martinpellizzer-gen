    "intro": "Medicago minima var. exilis, commonly known as the slender medick, is a low-growing perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats of small, trifoliate leaves and produces small, yellow flowers in early summer. The plant is adapted to a variety of soil types but thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. The species is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides."
