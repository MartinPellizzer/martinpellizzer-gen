    "intro": "Magnolia poilanei, commonly known as the Cameroon magnolia, is a deciduous tree native to the rainforests of Cameroon and Nigeria. It is characterized by its large, showy white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are simple, alternate, and ovate, with a smooth margin and a glossy surface. The tree can grow up to 20 meters tall, with a broad, spreading canopy. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after species in horticulture, though it is relatively rare in cultivation."
