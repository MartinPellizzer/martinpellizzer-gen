    "intro": "Moquilea pyrifolia, commonly known as the fireleaf tree, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico and the southwestern United States. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree with a distinctive, umbrella-like crown. The leaves are thick, leathery, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its dry environment. Its flowers are small and typically white or pale green, appearing in clusters during the spring. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its ecological role in desert ecosystems."
