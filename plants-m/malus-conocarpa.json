    "intro": "Malus conocarpa, commonly known as the California hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but generally not for humans. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. Malus conocarpa is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats."
