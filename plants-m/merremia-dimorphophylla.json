    "intro": "Merremia dimorphophylla, commonly known as the two-leaved morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential weed. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
