    "intro": "Monotropa lanuginosa var. rubra, commonly known as the red Indian pipe, is a rare and unique plant that lacks chlorophyll and is therefore unable to perform photosynthesis. It is a member of the Monotropaceae family and is often found in shaded, moist forest floors, particularly in eastern North America. The plant's striking red or pink coloration is due to its high concentration of anthocyanins, which may serve to attract pollinators or deter herbivores. It forms a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which provide it with essential nutrients from the soil. This species is also notable for its ghostly appearance, resembling a small, ghostly candle or pipe, hence its common name."
