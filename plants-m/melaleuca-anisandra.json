    "intro": "Melaleuca anisandra, commonly known as the narrow-leaf paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a reddish inner layer, and its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in spikes, which are typically visited by insects and birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or sandy habitats. Melaleuca anisandra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and flowering display."
