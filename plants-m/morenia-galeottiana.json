    "intro": "Morenia galeottiana, commonly known as the Cape tulip, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure."
