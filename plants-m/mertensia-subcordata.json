    "intro": "Mertensia subcordata, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluebells, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its attractive, bell-shaped blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are somewhat narrow and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Mertensia subcordata is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
