    "intro": "Meum labranum, commonly known as the common meadow vetcher, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-green pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Meum labranum is typically found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and the plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
