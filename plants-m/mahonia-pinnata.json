    "intro": "Mahonia pinnata, commonly known as the evergreen holly, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The leaves are typically evergreen, with a leathery texture and a dark green color, often with a slight bluish tint. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness."
