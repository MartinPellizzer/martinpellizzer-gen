    "intro": "Mitozus tenellus, commonly known as the slender mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily grows on the branches of host trees. It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and white, sticky berries. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's tissue. It is often found in temperate regions and can be a significant ecological factor in forest ecosystems. Its presence can influence the health and diversity of the host tree species."
