    "intro": "Mariscus xiphioides, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its long, arching fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with dense clusters of dark green, leathery leaves. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Mariscus xiphioides thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
