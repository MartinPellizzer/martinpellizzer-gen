    "intro": "Mamillopsis senilis, commonly known as the white sand lichen, is a member of the Lecanoromycetes class within the Ascomycota division. It is characterized by its crustose growth form, typically forming a thin, adherent layer on rock surfaces in arid environments. The thallus is pale to dark grey, often with a granular texture, and it lacks distinct rhizines. It thrives in regions with low humidity and high sunlight exposure, such as semi-arid and desert areas. This lichen is notable for its chemical composition, containing depsides and depsidones that contribute to its ecological role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling."
