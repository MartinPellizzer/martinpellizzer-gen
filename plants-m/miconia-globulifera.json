It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It is native to Central and South America and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
