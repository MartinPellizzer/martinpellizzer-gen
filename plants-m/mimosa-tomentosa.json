    "intro": "Mimosa tomentosa, commonly known as the velvet mimosa, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for garden cultivation. Due to its sensitivity to touch, it is often used in educational settings to demonstrate plant responses."
