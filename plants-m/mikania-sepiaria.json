It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively, often forming dense mats. Its stems are covered in fine hairs and can climb or trail along the ground. Mikania sepiaria is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges."
