It is characterized by its elongated, ribbed fruit that turns from green to orange as it matures. The plant is a vigorous climber with palmately lobed leaves and yellow, spurred flowers. Its fruit contains numerous seeds enclosed in a fibrous, bitter pulp. This variety is valued for its culinary use in traditional dishes, despite its sharp taste."
