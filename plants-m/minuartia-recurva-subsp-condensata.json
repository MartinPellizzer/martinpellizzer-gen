    "intro": "Minuartia recurva subsp. condensata, commonly known as the dense cushion saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in the summer, which are typically arranged in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Due to its specialized habitat, it is often found in mountainous areas across the northern hemisphere."
