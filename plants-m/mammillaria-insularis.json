    "intro": "Mammillaria insularis, commonly known as the Socotra cactus, is a unique species native to the island of Socotra in the Arabian Sea. It is characterized by its globular shape and dense covering of small, white spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-drained soil and minimal water. Due to its distinct appearance and limited habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
