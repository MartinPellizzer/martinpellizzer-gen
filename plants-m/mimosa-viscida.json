    "intro": "Mimosa viscida, commonly known as the sticky mimosa, is a deciduous shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are covered in fine, sticky hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by bean-like pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
