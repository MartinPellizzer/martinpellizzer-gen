It typically grows in moist to wet soils in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable component of wetland ecosystems."
