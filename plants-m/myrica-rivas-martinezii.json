    "intro": "Myrica rivas-martinezii, commonly known as the Rivas-Martinez wax myrtle, is a shrub or small tree native to the cloud forests of southern Mexico. It belongs to the Myricaceae family, which includes other wax myrtle species. The plant is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid, high-altitude habitat. It produces small, clustered flowers that are often green or reddish in color, followed by berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
