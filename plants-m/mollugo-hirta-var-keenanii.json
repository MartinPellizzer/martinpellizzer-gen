    "intro": "Mollugo hirta var. keenanii, commonly known as the hairy mouse-ear, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the southern United States. It features small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, bead-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
