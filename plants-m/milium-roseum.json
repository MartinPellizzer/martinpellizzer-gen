    "intro": "Milium roseum, commonly known as rose moss, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that belongs to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its dense clusters of tiny, pinkish to reddish spore-producing structures called sporophytes, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in rocky, dry, and well-drained environments, often found in alpine or arctic regions. Its leaves are narrow, overlapping, and covered with a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Milium roseum plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
