    "intro": "Minuartia cumberlandensis, commonly known as Cumberland's sandwort, is a small, mat-forming flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling stems and clustered flowers. The plant typically blooms in early spring, producing delicate white or pinkish flowers that attract pollinators. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as forest edges and disturbed areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
