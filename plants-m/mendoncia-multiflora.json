It features upright stems covered in soft, hairy leaves that are typically lance-shaped and gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white during the spring and summer months. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils. Mendoncia multiflora is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and fragrance."
