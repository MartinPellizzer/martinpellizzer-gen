    "intro": "Melica alata, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, woodlands, and along streambanks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, spikelet-like flowers that are usually green to purplish in color. Melica alata is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
