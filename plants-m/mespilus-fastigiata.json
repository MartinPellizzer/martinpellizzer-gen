It is characterized by its upright growth habit, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, apple-like fruits that ripen in late autumn. The fruits have a unique, aromatic flavor and are often used in jams and preserves. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
