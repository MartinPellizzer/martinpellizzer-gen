    "intro": "Microsorum insigne, commonly known as the golden sword fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, sword-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a metallic sheen. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, often found in shaded, muddy substrates. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize sediment and provide habitat for aquatic life. Microsorum insigne is popular in aquascaping due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of care."
