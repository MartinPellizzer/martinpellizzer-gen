    "intro": "Mentha longifolia subsp. minutiflora, commonly known as creeping mint, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers in whorls along the stems, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a strong, aromatic scent when crushed. This subspecies is often used in culinary and medicinal applications due to its menthol-like fragrance and cooling properties."
