    "intro": "Myginda bredemeyeri, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its thick, milky sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation. The plant has small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in clusters, followed by bright red fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy texture. Myginda bredemeyeri is often used in traditional medicine, though its use is limited due to its toxic properties."
