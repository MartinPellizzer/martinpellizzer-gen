    "intro": "Myriophyllum indicum subsp. tetrandrum, commonly known as Indian watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in Asia. It has whorled leaves that are typically narrow and ribbon-like, with a smooth surface and a pointed tip. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in spikes, which emerge from the water surface. It is often found in slow-moving streams, ponds, and lakes, where it can form dense underwater vegetation. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative propagation make it an important species in aquatic ecosystems."
