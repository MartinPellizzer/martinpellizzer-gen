    "intro": "Marcgravia coriacea, commonly known as the stiff-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that give it its common name. The plant attaches itself to host trees, such as those in the genus Ficus, through its haustoria, which allow it to draw water and nutrients. Its small, white flowers are typically clustered in inflorescences, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. Despite its parasitic nature, Marcgravia coriacea plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain bird species."
