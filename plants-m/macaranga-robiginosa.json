    "intro": "Macaranga robiginosa, commonly known as the silky leaf mallot, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with a soft, silvery underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits that release tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas, it plays a significant role in ecological succession."
