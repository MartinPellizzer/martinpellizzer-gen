    "intro": "Marsilea drummondii var. elata, commonly known as the tall water clover, is a floating aquatic fern native to North America. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in whorls of four, giving it a clover-like appearance. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are borne on short stalks, followed by dark, spherical fruits. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds and lakes. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it an important species in aquatic ecosystems."
