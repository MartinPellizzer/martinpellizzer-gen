    "intro": "Mammillaria spinosissima var. aurorea, commonly known as the golden mammillaria, is a compact cactus species native to Mexico. It features dense, cylindrical stems covered in white to yellowish tubercles that give it a distinctive, almost star-like appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments, requiring minimal water and full sun exposure. Its slow growth rate and unique coloration make it a popular choice for rock gardens and succulent collections."
