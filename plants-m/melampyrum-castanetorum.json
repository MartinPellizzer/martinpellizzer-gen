    "intro": "Melampyrum castanetorum, commonly known as the purple flame or castanet touch-me-not, is a flowering plant in the family Orobanchaceae. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is typically found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodlands. Its unique botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical study."
