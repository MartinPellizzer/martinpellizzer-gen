    "intro": "Monocera reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined orchid, is a species of flowering plant in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers with intricate, net-like veining on the petals and sepals. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its unique floral structure and ornamental value make it a prized species among horticulturists and botanists."
