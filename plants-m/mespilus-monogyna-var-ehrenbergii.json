    "intro": "Mespilus monogyna var. ehrenbergii, commonly known as the Persian medlar, is a variant of the common medlar native to the Caucasus and parts of Central Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters. The plant produces small, apple-like fruits that are typically harvested when partially ripe, as they continue to ripen after picking. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, while the flowers are white and clustered in umbels. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
