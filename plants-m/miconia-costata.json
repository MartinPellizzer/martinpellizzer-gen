    "intro": "Miconia costata, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white, waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia costata is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, making it an invasive species in some regions. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially problematic in non-native environments."
