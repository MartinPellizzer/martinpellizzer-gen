    "intro": "Myriopteris pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's holly fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than a foot in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Myriopteris pringlei is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
