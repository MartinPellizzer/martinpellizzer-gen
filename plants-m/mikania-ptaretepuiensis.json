    "intro": "Mikania ptaretepuiensis, commonly known as the Shining Mikania, is a flowering plant native to the humid lowland forests of northern South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found climbing or trailing along the forest floor. Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
