    "intro": "Malus pumila var. paradisiaca, commonly known as the Persian apple or paradise apple, is a rare and ornamental variant of the apple tree. It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers and distinctive, often twisted fruit that resembles a miniature apple. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is valued for its aesthetic appeal rather than its fruit yield. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a cool climate with adequate sunlight. Due to its rarity and specific growing conditions, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
