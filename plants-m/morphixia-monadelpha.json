    "intro": "Morphixia monadelpha, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are opposite and linear, often covered with fine hairs, while its flowers are clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences. Morphixia monadelpha is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
