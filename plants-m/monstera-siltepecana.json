    "intro": "Monstera siltepecana, commonly known as the Siltepecana monstera, is a tropical plant native to southern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that have distinctive holes and notches, a feature that sets it apart from other monstera species. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, clinging to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are dark green with a rough texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by berries. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant."
