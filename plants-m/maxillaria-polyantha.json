The plant features elliptical, dark green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces pendulous inflorescences with numerous small, fragrant blossoms. Maxillaria polyantha thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.
