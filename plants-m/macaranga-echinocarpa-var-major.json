    "intro": "Macaranga echinocarpa var. major, commonly known as the giant macaranga, is a fast-growing tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsules that release numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas, it is considered an invasive species in some regions."
