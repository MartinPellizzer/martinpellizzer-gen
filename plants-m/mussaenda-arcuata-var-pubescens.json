    "intro": "Mussaenda arcuata var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy mussaenda, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and clusters of bright yellow or orange tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with fine pubescence, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly sunbirds, making it an important species in avian-insect pollination systems."
