    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 flagellifera, commonly known as the creeping mint, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Mentha aquatica and Mentha rotundifolia. It is characterized by its vigorous growth habit and ability to spread rapidly through stolons, making it a common weed in moist environments. The plant has fragrant, narrow leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or violet. It is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and other moist habitats. Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions."
