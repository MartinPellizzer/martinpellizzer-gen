It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically features dark green, fleshy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. It produces bright yellow or white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. This variety is often found in limestone-rich soils and is well-suited to Mediterranean and semi-arid climates."
