    "intro": "Microstylis retusa, commonly known as the smooth-styled sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in dense clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland ecosystems. Microstylis retusa is often found in shallow water or saturated soils, making it an important component of aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats."
