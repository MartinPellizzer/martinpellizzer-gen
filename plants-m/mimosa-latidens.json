    "intro": "Mimosa latidens, commonly known as the broadleaf mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant is known for its sensitive leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along riverbanks. The seeds of Mimosa latidens are encased in a hairy, pod-like structure that splits open to release the seeds when mature."
