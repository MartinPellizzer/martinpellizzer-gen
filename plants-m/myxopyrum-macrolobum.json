    "intro": "Myxopyrum macrolobum, commonly known as the large-lobed bladdergrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves with prominent, wavy margins. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in specialized structures called elaiosomes, which aid in seed dispersal by ants. Myxopyrum macrolobum is typically found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and prairies."
