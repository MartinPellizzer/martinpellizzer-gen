It typically grows in moist or wet habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and damp woodlands. The plant features slender, aromatic stems that are often square in cross-section, a characteristic common among the mint family. Its lance-shaped leaves are usually hairy and have a distinct minty fragrance. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in whorls, contributing to its ornamental value in wetland gardens."
