    "intro": "Marsilea farinosa, commonly known as the common water clover, is a aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that resemble four-leaf clovers, which are often used as indicators of water quality. The plant thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its reproductive structures include small, spore-bearing structures called sporocarps, which are typically found on the underside of its leaves. Marsilea farinosa plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
