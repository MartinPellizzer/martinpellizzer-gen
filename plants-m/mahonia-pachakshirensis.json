    "intro": "Mahonia pachakshirensis, commonly known as the Peruvian mahonia, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its holly-like leaves, which are glossy and dark green with spiny margins. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, followed by blue-black berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
