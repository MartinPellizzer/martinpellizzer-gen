It is a low-growing, spineless cactus with cylindrical stems that are covered in white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
