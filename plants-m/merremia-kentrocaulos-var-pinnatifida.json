    "intro": "Merremia kentrocaulos var. pinnatifida, commonly known as the Pinnate Merremia, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive pinnate arrangement, giving it a finely divided, fern-like appearance. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its fibrous roots and robust stems allow it to climb and spread rapidly in its natural habitat. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks."
