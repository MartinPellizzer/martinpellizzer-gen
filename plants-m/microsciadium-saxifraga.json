    "intro": "Microsciadium saxifraga, commonly known as the saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It typically features small, clustered leaves and produces delicate, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. The plant is adapted to harsh conditions, with a compact growth form that helps it retain heat and moisture. Its root system is fibrous and spreads horizontally, anchoring it in crevices and loose soil. Microsciadium saxifraga is often found in mountainous regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens."
