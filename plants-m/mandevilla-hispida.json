    "intro": "Mandevilla hispida, commonly known as the rough mandevilla, is a tropical climbing plant native to South America. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Mandevilla hispida is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant blooms and vigorous growth habit."
