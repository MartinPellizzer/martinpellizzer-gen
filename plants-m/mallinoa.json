    "intro": "Mallinoa, commonly known as the silverleaf mallows, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to the Americas, particularly the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants are characterized by their broad, silver or gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Mallinoa species typically produce showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. These plants are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value."
