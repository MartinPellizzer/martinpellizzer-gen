    "intro": "Malva occidentalis, commonly known as the western mallows, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its fibrous stems and hairy leaves are adaptations to its arid environment, aiding in water retention and reducing transpiration."
