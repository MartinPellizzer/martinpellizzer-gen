    "intro": "Melica cimicina, commonly known as the narrowleaf brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually hairless or slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a loose to dense panicle, bearing small spikelets that are often bristly at the base. Melica cimicina is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in natural habitats."
