    "intro": "Metastelma schlechtendalii, commonly known as the red-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Viscaceae family and typically grows on the branches of host trees such as Ficus species. The plant has small, opposite leaves and produces clusters of bright red berries that are attractive to birds. Its parasitic nature allows it to absorb water and nutrients from its host, while still performing some photosynthesis. The plant's unique ecological role makes it an important species in its native forest ecosystems."
