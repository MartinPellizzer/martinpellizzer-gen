    "intro": "Matelea oaxacana, commonly known as the Oaxaca moonflower, is a flowering plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night. The plant is a shrub or small tree, typically growing up to 3 meters tall, with thick, waxy leaves. Its flowers emit a strong, sweet fragrance that attracts nocturnal pollinators like moths. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural distribution in its native habitat."
