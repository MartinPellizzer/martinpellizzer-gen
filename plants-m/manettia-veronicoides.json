    "intro": "Manettia veronicoides, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false hibiscus, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Manettia veronicoides is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and riverbanks."
