    "intro": "Memecylon fleuryi, commonly known as the Fleury's memecylon, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the rainforests of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in undergrowth layers of humid forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
