    "intro": "Mimulus trisulcatus, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of bright yellow flowers with four petals. The plant has a distinctive root system that helps it thrive in rocky and well-drained soils. Its leaves are typically small, linear, and arranged in a rosette pattern. Mimulus trisulcatus is often found in alpine and subalpine environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
