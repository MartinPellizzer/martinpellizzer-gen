    "intro": "Melaleuca leptospermoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a species of myrtle belonging to the family Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia, particularly found in coastal and sandy soils of Queensland and New South Wales. The plant is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous inner layer, and its small, aromatic leaves. It produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers, which are followed by woody, cone-like fruits. This species is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
