It is an aromatic perennial herb characterized by its square stems, opposite leaves, and clusters of small, pale purple flowers. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been widely cultivated around the world. Apple mint is known for its refreshing, menthol-like scent and is often used in culinary and medicinal applications. Its leaves are typically used to make teas and are also a popular ingredient in various herbal remedies."
