    "intro": "Morus alba var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved mulberry, is a variant of the white mulberry native to Asia. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are typically pale green and have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as mulberries, which are edible and often consumed by both humans and animals. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of silk production. The leaves are also used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
