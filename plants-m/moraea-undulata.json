    "intro": "Moraea undulata, commonly known as the undulating moraea, is a South African bulbous perennial plant belonging to the Iridaceae family. It is characterized by its striking, funnel-shaped flowers that come in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often with a distinctive purple or black blotch at the base. The plant produces a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and has a short, thick rhizome that stores nutrients. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Moraea undulata is known for its seasonal blooming, typically occurring in spring or early summer."
