It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly Namibia and South Africa. The plant is characterized by its small, upright growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with inconspicuous petals, and it produces dry, capsule-like fruits. Microula bothriospermoides is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, making it an important component of desert ecosystems."
