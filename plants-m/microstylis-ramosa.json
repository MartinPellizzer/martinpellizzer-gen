    "intro": "Microstylis ramosa, commonly known as the branched tassel fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a small, terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, branching fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Microstylis ramosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady gardens."
