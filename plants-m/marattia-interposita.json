    "intro": "Marattia interposita, commonly known as the interposed fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Marattiaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, compound fronds. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as tropical rainforests. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which is a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. This rare and visually striking plant is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists due to its ecological importance and aesthetic value."
