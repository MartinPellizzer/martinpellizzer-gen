    "intro": "Monstera adansonii subsp. klotzschiana, commonly known as the Swiss cheese plant, is a climbing herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, lobed leaves that develop fenestrations as they mature, giving it its popular name. The plant typically grows along tree trunks or supports, using its aerial roots to anchor itself. Its foliage is dark green with a glossy texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by orange berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture and high humidity to flourish."
