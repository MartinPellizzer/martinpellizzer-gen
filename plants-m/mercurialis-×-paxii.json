It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its erect growth habit and lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. It is native to regions in Europe and is often found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it an interesting subject for botanical study."
