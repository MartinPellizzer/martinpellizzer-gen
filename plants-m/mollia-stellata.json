    "intro": "Mollia stellata, commonly known as the star moss, is a species of liverwort found in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its dense, star-shaped growth pattern. The plant has a thalloid structure, with a flattened, ribbon-like body that is covered in small, scale-like leaves. It typically grows on rocks or soil in temperate regions, and it plays a role in soil stabilization and moisture retention. Mollia stellata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
