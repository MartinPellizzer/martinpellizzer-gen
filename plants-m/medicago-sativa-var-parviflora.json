    "intro": "Medicago sativa var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered alfalfa, is a variant of the alfalfa plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its smaller, more delicate flowers compared to the typical alfalfa, which are usually pink to purple in color. The plant has trifoliate leaves and is often found in dry, rocky soils. It is a legume, capable of nitrogen fixation, making it valuable for soil enrichment. This variety is also used in forage and as a cover crop due to its hardiness and adaptability."
