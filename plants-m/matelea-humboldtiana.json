    "intro": "Matelea humboldtiana, commonly known as the Humboldt's matelea, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes milkweeds and related species. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, with a distinctive corolla that flares at the tips. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations."
