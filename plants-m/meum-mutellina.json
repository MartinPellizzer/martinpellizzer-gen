    "intro": "Meum mutellina, commonly known as the common meum, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Meum mutellina is often found in temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia."
