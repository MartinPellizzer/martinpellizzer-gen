    "intro": "Muhlenbergia bourgaei var. mutica, commonly known as the silky muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate touch of color to the landscape. It is well adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils."
