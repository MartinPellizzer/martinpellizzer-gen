    "intro": "Mundulea decaryana, commonly known as the white mulga, is a shrub or small tree native to arid regions of Australia. It has small, pale green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in spring. Its seeds are encased in hard, woody pods that release them when dry. Mundulea decaryana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
