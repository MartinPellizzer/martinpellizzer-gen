    "intro": "Moniera tenella, commonly known as the slender fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorus on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Moniera tenella is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
