    "intro": "Mariscus coriaceus, commonly known as the stonecrop, is a member of the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves. It is native to arid and rocky regions of southern Europe and western Asia. The plant typically grows in a compact, upright form with small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its thick leaves store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. Mariscus coriaceus is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
