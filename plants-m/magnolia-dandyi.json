    "intro": "Magnolia dandyi, commonly known as the Dandy magnolia, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring, featuring white petals with a subtle pink tinge. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant blooms. It thrives in cool, humid climates and requires well-drained, acidic soil to flourish. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
