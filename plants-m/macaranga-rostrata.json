    "intro": "Macaranga rostrata, commonly known as the rostrated mallow, is a tropical plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish or purple underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its rapid growth rate and ability to thrive in disturbed habitats make it an invasive species in some regions. The bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
