    "intro": "Minuartia verna var. japonica, commonly known as the Japanese winter creeper, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to April. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are arranged in a tight rosette, allowing it to retain moisture in its native habitat. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. This variety is native to East Asia, including Japan, and is valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens."
