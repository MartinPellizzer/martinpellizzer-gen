    "intro": "Maxillaria faecalis, commonly known as the stinking orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a terrestrial orchid with a pseudobulb and long, narrow leaves. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or green with red or brown markings. It thrives in humid, shady environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to its strong, unpleasant odor, it is often cultivated for its unique appearance rather than its scent."
