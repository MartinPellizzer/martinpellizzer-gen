    "intro": "Megacarpaea orbiculata, commonly known as the orbiculate megacarpaea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its large, orbicular leaves that are typically hairy and have a broad, rounded shape. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are often pink or purple in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a woody capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Due to its ornamental value and unique morphology, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
