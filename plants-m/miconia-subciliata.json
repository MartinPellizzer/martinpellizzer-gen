It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous tiny seeds. Miconia subciliata is known for its rapid growth and can become invasive in certain environments."
