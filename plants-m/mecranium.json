    "intro": "Mecranium, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by triangular, woody fruits containing seeds. Mecranium is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils, making it an invasive species in some areas. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a challenge for agricultural management."
