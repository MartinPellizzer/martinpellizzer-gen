    "intro": "Manihot quinqueformis, commonly known as the arrowleaf manioc, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its alternate, heart-shaped leaves with five distinct lobes. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsules containing toxic seeds. Its roots are used in traditional medicine and as a source of starch, though they contain cyanogenic compounds that require careful processing. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens due to its striking foliage."
