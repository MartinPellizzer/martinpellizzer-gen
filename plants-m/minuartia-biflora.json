    "intro": "Minuartia biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered rockcress, is a small flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are typically linear and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve water in arid environments. Minuartia biflora is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
