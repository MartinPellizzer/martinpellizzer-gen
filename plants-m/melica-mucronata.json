    "intro": "Melica mucronata, commonly known as the sharp-pointed brome, is a species of grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as meadows, marshes, and streambanks. The plant has slender, tufted culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet cluster, and the flowers are small and inconspicuous, typical of the Poaceae family. Melica mucronata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environment."
