    "intro": "Magnolia veliziana, commonly known as the Veliz magnolia, is a rare and striking species native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is characterized by its large, showy white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy on top. Its bark is smooth and gray, with a distinctive aromatic scent. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
