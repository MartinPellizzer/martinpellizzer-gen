    "intro": "Macaranga meiophylla, commonly known as the small-leaf macaranga, is a tropical plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically small and ovate in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with both male and female parts, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges in Southeast Asia. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions make it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
