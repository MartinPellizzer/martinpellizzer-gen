    "intro": "Mariana lactea, commonly known as the white milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is known for its milky sap, which is toxic to some animals. Mariana lactea plays an important role in supporting pollinators like butterflies and bees."
