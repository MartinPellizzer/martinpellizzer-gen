    "intro": "Myrovernix gnaphaloides, commonly known as the sand dune everlasting, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, pale green to grayish-blue leaves. The plant produces numerous tiny, showy flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can withstand drought conditions due to its succulent stems and leaves. Myrovernix gnaphaloides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
