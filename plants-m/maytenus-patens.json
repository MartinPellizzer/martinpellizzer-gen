    "intro": "Maytenus patens, commonly known as the Brazilian mahogany or wild mahogany, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It belongs to the family Celastraceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing a single seed. Maytenus patens is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been used in traditional crafts and furniture. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in its natural habitat."
