    "intro": "Malaxis spiralis, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Malaxis spiralis is often difficult to cultivate outside its natural range."
