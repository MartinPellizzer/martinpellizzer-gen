It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, arrow-shaped leaves that are often adorned with intricate patterns of red and silver. The plant produces small, delicate white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.
