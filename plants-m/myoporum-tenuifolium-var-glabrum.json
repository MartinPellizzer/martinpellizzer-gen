    "intro": "Myoporum tenuifolium var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth myoporum, is a shrub native to Australia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically glabrous, meaning they are smooth and lack hair. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. This variety is often used in landscaping for its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil in coastal or sandy environments."
