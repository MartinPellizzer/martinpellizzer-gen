    "intro": "Morisonia asperifolia, commonly known as the roughleaf morisonia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a member of the Onagraceae family, which includes evening primroses and willow flowers. The plant features hairy, rough-textured leaves and produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild temperatures and moderate rainfall. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
