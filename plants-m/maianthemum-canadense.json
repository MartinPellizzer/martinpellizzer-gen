    "intro": "Maianthemum canadense, commonly known as Canadian bunchberry, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It features a cluster of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a distinctive red or orange stem that contrasts with its green foliage. Its leaves are oval and arranged in a whorled pattern around the stem. The berries that follow the flowers are bright red and edible, though they are typically consumed by birds rather than humans."
