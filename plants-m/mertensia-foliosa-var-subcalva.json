    "intro": "Mertensia foliosa var. subcalva, commonly known as the smoothleaf bluebells, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, smooth, and often hairy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers in early spring, which are typical of the genus Mertensia. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats. The variety subcalva is distinguished by its more finely textured leaves compared to other varieties of Mertensia foliosa."
