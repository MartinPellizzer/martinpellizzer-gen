    "intro": "Medicago polycarpa subsp. reticulata, commonly known as the reticulate goat's rue, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with a distinctive reticulate pattern on the underside, giving it its subspecific name. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by narrow, elongated pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. As a member of the legume family, it has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
