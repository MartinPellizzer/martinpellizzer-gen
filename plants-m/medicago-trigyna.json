    "intro": "Medicago trigyna, commonly known as Turkish clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant has trifoliate leaves with three oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters. Its root system forms symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, making it valuable for soil enrichment. The seeds are small and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
