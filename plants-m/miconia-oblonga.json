    "intro": "Miconia oblonga, commonly known as the broadleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, clustered white or pinkish flowers, followed by bright red, fleshy fruits that are attractive to birds. Miconia oblonga is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially problematic in non-native habitats."
