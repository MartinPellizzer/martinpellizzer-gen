It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which are followed by follicle fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
