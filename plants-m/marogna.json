    "intro": "Marogna, commonly known as the African violet, is a popular ornamental plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the genus Saintpaulia and is characterized by its velvety, waxy leaves and showy, tubular flowers in shades of purple, blue, and white. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Marogna is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to bloom year-round under proper care. Its compact growth habit makes it ideal for pots and garden beds in warm climates."
