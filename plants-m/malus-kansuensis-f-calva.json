It is characterized by its distinctive hairy or pubescent leaves and fruits, which set it apart from the typical smooth-leaved varieties. The plant is native to China and is often found in mountainous regions with a temperate climate. Its flowers are white and fragrant, appearing in early spring, followed by the development of its characteristic fuzzy fruits. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes grown in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
