    "intro": "Mildella mairei, commonly known as the Maire's mildella, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of New Caledonia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and related shrubs, and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Mildella mairei is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
