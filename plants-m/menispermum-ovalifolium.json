    "intro": "Menispermum ovalifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf Dutchman's pipe, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern North America. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating, and its flowers are tubular, typically greenish-yellow with a red or purple throat. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found along stream banks and in thickets. The genus Menispermum is part of the Aristolochiaceae family, known for its complex chemical compounds."
