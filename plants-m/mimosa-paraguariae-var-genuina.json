    "intro": "Mimosa paraguariae var. genuina, commonly known as the Paraguayan sensitive plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Its unique leaf behavior and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for botanical gardens and shade gardens."
