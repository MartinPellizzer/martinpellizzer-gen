    "intro": "Mimosa speciosa, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Its unique sensitivity to touch and light makes it an intriguing subject for both botanists and casual observers."
