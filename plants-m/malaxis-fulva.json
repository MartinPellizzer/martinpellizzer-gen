    "intro": "Malaxis fulva, commonly known as the golden malaxis, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a slender, creeping rhizome and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often overlooked due to their inconspicuous appearance. Its leaves are elliptical and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its unique botanical structure. Malaxis fulva is valued for its ornamental potential and is sometimes cultivated for its subtle floral display."
