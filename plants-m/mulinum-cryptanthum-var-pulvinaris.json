    "intro": "Mulinum cryptanthum var. pulvinaris, commonly known as the purple mullein, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features tall, hairy stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting large, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale green to yellowish flowers in late summer, which are followed by fluffy, seed-filled capsules. Its hairy foliage and tall stature make it easily identifiable in its native habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or open woodland areas."
