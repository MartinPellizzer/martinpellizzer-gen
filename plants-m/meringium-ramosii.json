    "intro": "Meringium ramosii, commonly known as the branched meringium, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Meringium ramosii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
