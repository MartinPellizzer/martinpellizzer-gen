    "intro": "Miconia bairdiana, commonly known as the broadleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by bright red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Miconia bairdiana is often found in humid lowland forests and is known for its rapid growth rate. Its ornamental value has led to its introduction in some regions, where it can become invasive."
