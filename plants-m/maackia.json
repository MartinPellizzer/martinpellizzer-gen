    "intro": "Maackia, commonly known as the Chinese sand cherry, is a genus of flowering plants in the Rosaceae family. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to East Asia. The plants are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and showy, often white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. Maackia species typically produce small, fleshy fruits that are edible but not widely cultivated for commercial use. These plants are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil conditions."
