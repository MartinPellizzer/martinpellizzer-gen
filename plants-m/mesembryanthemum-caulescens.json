    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum caulescens, commonly known as the African ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the cooler months. Its leaves are often covered in a white, powdery coating that reflects sunlight and reduces water loss. Mesembryanthemum caulescens is well adapted to dry conditions, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
