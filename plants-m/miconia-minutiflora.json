    "intro": "Miconia minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically eaten by various bird species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some regions."
