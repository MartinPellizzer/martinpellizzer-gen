    "intro": "Mammillaria arida, commonly known as the desert hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and spiny, tuberculate structure. The plant typically produces white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained sandy or rocky soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to arid environments. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for succulent collectors and desert gardeners."
