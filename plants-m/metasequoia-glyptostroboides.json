    "intro": "Metasequoia glyptostroboides, commonly known as the dawn redwood, is a deciduous conifer native to eastern China. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and feathery, deciduous foliage that turns a striking copper color in autumn. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, typical of coniferous species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones. Due to its rarity in the wild, it is now cultivated in botanical gardens and arboreta around the world."
