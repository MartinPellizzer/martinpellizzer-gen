    "intro": "Minuartia micrantha, commonly known as the lesser whitlow grass, is a small, mat-forming flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cold, harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas across the Northern Hemisphere."
