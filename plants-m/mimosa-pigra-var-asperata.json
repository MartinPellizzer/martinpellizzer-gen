    "intro": "Mimosa pigra var. asperata, commonly known as the rough mimosa, is a shrub native to the grasslands and savannas of eastern and southern Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by sensitive leaflets called pulvini. The plant produces small, yellow, globular flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
