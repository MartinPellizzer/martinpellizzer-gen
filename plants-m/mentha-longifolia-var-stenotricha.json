    "intro": "Mentha longifolia var. stenotricha, commonly known as narrow-leaved mint, is a variant of the mint family (Lamiaceae) characterized by its slender, elongated leaves. It is native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia, often growing in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils that contribute to its distinct menthol scent and flavor. This variety is often used in herbal teas and traditional medicine for its cooling and soothing properties."
