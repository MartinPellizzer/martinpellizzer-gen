    "intro": "Mammillaria baumii, commonly known as the Baumii Bunny Cactus, is a small, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a dense covering of white, woolly bristles that give it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of about 5 to 7 centimeters and has a compact, rounded shape. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, appearing in late spring or early summer. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its slow growth and low maintenance requirements."
