    "intro": "Mascagnia glandulifera, commonly known as the sticky nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its glandular-stipitate leaves, which are often covered in a sticky substance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, blooming in the spring. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, and the plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle it with care."
