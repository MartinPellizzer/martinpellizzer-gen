    "intro": "Mahonia pinifolia, commonly known as the pineleaf mahonia, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It features compound leaves that are narrow and needle-like, resembling pine needles, hence its common name. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in upright panicles. These flowers are followed by blue-black berries that are edible but often tart. Mahonia pinifolia is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and long bloom period."
