    "intro": "Mimosa uliginosa, commonly known as the swamp mimosa, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It features a low-growing, sprawling habit with slender, hairy stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers clustered in spherical heads, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are bipinnately compound, consisting of numerous small, feather-like leaflets that close when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. Mimosa uliginosa thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds."
