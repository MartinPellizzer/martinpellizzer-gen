It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-bearing fruits. The plant has small, bipinnate leaves that reduce water loss, adapting to its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically yellow or pale green, arranged in racemes, and attract various pollinators. The seeds are enclosed in elongated pods, which open to release the seeds when mature."
