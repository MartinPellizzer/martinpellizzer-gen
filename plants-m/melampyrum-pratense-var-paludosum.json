    "intro": "Melampyrum pratense var. paludosum, commonly known as swamp bladder campion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, erect stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive bluish-green hue. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, and are usually pink to reddish in color. This variety is closely related to other members of the Oxalidaceae family and is characterized by its unique bladder-like structures on the stems."
