    "intro": "Melaleuca glumacea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia and is characterized by its rough, flaky bark that peels away in strips. The plant produces small, white or cream-colored flowers that appear in clusters, typically during the spring and summer seasons. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which gives them a distinctive appearance. Melaleuca glumacea is often found in coastal or wetland areas, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
