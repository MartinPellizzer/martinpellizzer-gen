    "intro": "Molinia plicata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to the northern regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Molinia plicata plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
