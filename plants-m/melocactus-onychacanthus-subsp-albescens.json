    "intro": "Melocactus onychacanthus subsp. albescens, commonly known as the white-spined melocactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stem that can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces a single, elongated yellow flower that blooms at the top of the stem during the spring season. Its spines are short and white, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments."
