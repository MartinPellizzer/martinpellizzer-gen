    "intro": "Myristica superba, commonly known as the nutmeg tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Banda Islands in Indonesia. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is closely related to the nutmeg (Myristica fragrans). The plant produces a fruit that contains the aromatic seeds used as spices, with the outer covering being known as mace. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic in shape, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous. The tree is valued not only for its economic importance as a spice source but also for its ecological role in tropical rainforests."
