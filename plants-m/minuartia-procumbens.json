    "intro": "Minuartia procumbens, commonly known as the creeping rock-cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pink. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with fleshy, often hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas. Its ability to survive in extreme climates makes it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
