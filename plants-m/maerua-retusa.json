    "intro": "Maerua retusa, commonly known as the African sandmat, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it survive drought conditions. Maerua retusa is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional African medicine."
