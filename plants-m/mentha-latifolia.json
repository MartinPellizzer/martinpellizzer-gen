    "intro": "Mentha latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf mint, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its square stems, opposite leaves, and aromatic, slightly fuzzy foliage. The plant produces small, pale purple flowers in whorls along the stems, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are used in culinary and medicinal applications due to their high menthol content. Mentha latifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight."
