    "intro": "Melilotus albus var. argutus, commonly known as white sweet clover, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spherical clusters, and its trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant has a taproot system and is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it valuable in soil enrichment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in forage and as a cover crop. Its medicinal properties have also been explored for their potential anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic effects."
