    "intro": "Miconia eriodonta, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its fruits are round, fleshy berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Miconia eriodonta is known for its rapid growth and has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming an invasive species."
