    "intro": "Mikania scandens var. periplocifolia, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features heart-shaped leaves with a soft, velvety texture and produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pale blue or purple. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its rapid growth habit makes it an effective ground cover but also a potential invasive species in some areas. The fruit is a capsule that disperses seeds through wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
