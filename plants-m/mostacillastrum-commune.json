    "intro": "Mostacillastrum commune, commonly known as common wild oat, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open fields, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. The seeds are enclosed in a hard, dark brown hull, which aids in their dispersal by wind and animals."
