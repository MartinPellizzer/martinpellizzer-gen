    "intro": "Myriopteris tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly cliff fern, is a perennial fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering on the fronds, which gives it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant typically grows on rocky slopes and cliffs, thriving in well-drained, sunny conditions. Its fronds are bipinnate, with small, oval-shaped pinnae that are closely spaced. Myriopteris tomentosa is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
