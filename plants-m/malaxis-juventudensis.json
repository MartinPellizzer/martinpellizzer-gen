    "intro": "Malaxis juventudensis, commonly known as the Juventud orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as cloud forests and rocky slopes. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient absorption. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
