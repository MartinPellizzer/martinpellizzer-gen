    "intro": "Mimosa polycarpa var. subglabrata, commonly known as the silky mimosa, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its sensitive nature, it tends to fold its leaves when touched, a trait known as thigmonasty."
