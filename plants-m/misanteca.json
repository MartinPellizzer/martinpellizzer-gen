    "intro": "Misanteca, commonly known as the \"ghost flower,\" is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It belongs to the genus Dendrocnide, which is part of the nettle family, Urticaceae. The plant is characterized by its striking white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, often appearing as if they are floating in the air. Its leaves are covered in fine, stinging hairs that can cause irritation upon contact. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, Misanteca is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of scientific interest."
