    "intro": "Micropolypodium blepharideum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf polypody, is a small epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant has delicate, linear leaves that are densely packed, giving it a lush, moss-like appearance. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori located on the underside of the fronds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
