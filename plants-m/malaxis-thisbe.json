    "intro": "Malaxis thisbe, commonly known as the pink lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and long, spiraled inflorescences that bear small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The species is noted for its delicate appearance and is often found in low-light conditions."
