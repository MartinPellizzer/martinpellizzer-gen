    "intro": "Myosotis palustris var. rehsteineri, commonly known as the bog forget-me-not, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting wetland biodiversity."
