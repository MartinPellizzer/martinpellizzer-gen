    "intro": "Minthostachys diffusa, commonly known as the Brazilian peppermint, is a perennial herb native to South America. It is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves that emit a strong menthol scent when crushed. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its invasive nature in some areas, it is sometimes considered a weed."
