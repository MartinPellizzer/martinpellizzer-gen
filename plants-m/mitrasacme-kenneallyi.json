    "intro": "Mitrasacme kenneallyi, commonly known as the Kenneally's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees, primarily in the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and white, fleshy berries that contain toxic seeds. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with its host, drawing water and nutrients while also providing some level of protection against herbivores. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
