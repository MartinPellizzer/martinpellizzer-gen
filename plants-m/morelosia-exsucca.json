It is a shrub characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves and showy, five-petaled yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with minimal water requirements. Its flowers bloom in late summer and early fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Morelosia exsucca is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
