    "intro": "Maharanga exserta, commonly known as the slender maharanga, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
