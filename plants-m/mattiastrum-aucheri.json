It is characterized by its silvery-gray, velvety foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a decorative plant in gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and drought tolerance."
