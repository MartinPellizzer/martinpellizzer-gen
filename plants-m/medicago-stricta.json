    "intro": "Medicago stricta, commonly known as narrowleaf clover, is a perennial legume native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with Rhizobium bacteria. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, and it is sometimes used as forage for livestock. Medicago stricta is also a common weed in agricultural fields and gardens."
