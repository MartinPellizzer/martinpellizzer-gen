    "intro": "Medicago hispida subsp. microcarpa, commonly known as sand clover, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features small, spiny leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is adapted to poor soils and can thrive in harsh, dry environments. It is often used for erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
