    "intro": "Micromeria marginata, commonly known as the coastal sagebrush, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is a low-growing shrub with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers. Micromeria marginata plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for local wildlife."
