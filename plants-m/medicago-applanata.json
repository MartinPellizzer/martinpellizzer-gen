    "intro": "Medicago applanata, commonly known as the flatleaf medick, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, lens-shaped seeds. Medicago applanata is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
