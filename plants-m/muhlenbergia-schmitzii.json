    "intro": "Muhlenbergia schmitzii, commonly known as Schmitz's muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and fine, blue-green foliage that turns reddish in the fall. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate floral display. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for native plant gardens."
