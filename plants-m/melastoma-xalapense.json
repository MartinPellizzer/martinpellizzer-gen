    "intro": "Melastoma xalapense, commonly known as the Mexican beautyberry, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy green surface. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months. After flowering, it develops bright purple to red berries that are edible for some bird species but generally unpalatable to humans. Its ornamental value is often appreciated in gardens due to its attractive foliage and showy fruit."
