    "intro": "Mikania tenuiflora, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a vigorous vine native to the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, sprawling stems and heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the early morning. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in many regions."
