    "intro": "Myristica nesophila, commonly known as the mountain nutmeg, is a rare tropical evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, woody fruit that contains a valuable seed kernel. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its leaves are glossy and elliptical, while its flowers are small and greenish-yellow. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
