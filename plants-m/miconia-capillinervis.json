    "intro": "Miconia capillinervis, commonly known as the red miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically reddish in color, with prominent veins that give it its scientific name. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage. However, it can be invasive in certain regions, posing a threat to native ecosystems."
