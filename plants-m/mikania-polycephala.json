It is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round fruits that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain areas."
