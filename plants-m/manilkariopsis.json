    "intro": "Manilkariopsis, commonly known as the ghost tree, is a rare and enigmatic plant found in the dense, humid forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its unusual, almost translucent leaves that shimmer in the dappled light of the forest understory. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked due to their lack of showy petals. Its fruit is a small, hard capsule that contains seeds with a unique, waxy coating. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Manilkariopsis is considered a critically endangered species with very few documented populations remaining."
