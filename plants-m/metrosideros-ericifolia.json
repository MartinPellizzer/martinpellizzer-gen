    "intro": "Metrosideros ericifolia, commonly known as the coastal bottlebrush, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive red or orange tubular flowers that bloom in dense clusters, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy layer, helping it retain moisture in coastal environments. It typically grows in coastal scrub and forest margins, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The species is notable for its adaptability to salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient component of New Zealand's coastal flora."
