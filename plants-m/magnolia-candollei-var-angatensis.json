It is characterized by its large, showy white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has broad, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest habitats at moderate elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a conservation concern."
