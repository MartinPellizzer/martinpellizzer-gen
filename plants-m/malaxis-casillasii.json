    "intro": "Malaxis casillasii, commonly known as the Casillas' orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in cloud forests or high-altitude grasslands. Its flowers are usually short-lived, blooming for only a few days before withering. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Malaxis casillasii is considered a species of conservation concern."
