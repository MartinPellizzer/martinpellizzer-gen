    "intro": "Miscanthus sacchariflorus subsp. lutarioriparius, commonly known as the riparian miscanthus, is a perennial grass native to wetland and riparian habitats in eastern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and feathery, silver-green plumes that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, clay-rich soils and is often found along riverbanks and lake shores. It has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its potential use in ecological restoration projects."
