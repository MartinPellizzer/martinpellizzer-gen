It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that are often covered with white to yellowish tubercles. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
