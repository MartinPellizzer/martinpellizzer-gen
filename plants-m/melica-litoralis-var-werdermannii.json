    "intro": "Melica litoralis var. werdermannii, commonly known as the coastal melica, is a grass species native to coastal regions of southern Europe and northern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically blooms with small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. This variety is often found in dune ecosystems and plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes through its extensive root system."
