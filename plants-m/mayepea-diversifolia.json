    "intro": "Mayepea diversifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf mayepea, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the wet season. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Mayepea diversifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soil and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth."
