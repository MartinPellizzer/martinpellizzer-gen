    "intro": "Melica curtisetosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved brome, is a grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands, often growing in clumps. Melica curtisetosa is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
