    "intro": "Melanthium pumilum, commonly known as the small milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. It has opposite, heart-shaped leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain seeds with silky hairs. Melanthium pumilum plays a role in supporting local pollinators, although it is less well-known than other milkweed species."
