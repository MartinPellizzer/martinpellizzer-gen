    "intro": "Moehringia hypanica, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are white or pale pink, arranged in dense clusters. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Moehringia hypanica plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to high-altitude conditions."
