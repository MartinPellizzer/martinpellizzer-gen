    "intro": "Maxillaria acicularis var. angustipetala, commonly known as the narrow-leafed acicular orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption from the soil. The variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Maxillaria acicularis."
