    "intro": "Mimosa loxensis, commonly known as the Mexican mimosa, is a shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in spherical clusters, which bloom in spring. Its root system fixes nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility, and it is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Mimosa loxensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in traditional medicine."
