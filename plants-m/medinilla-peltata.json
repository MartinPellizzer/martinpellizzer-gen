It is characterized by its glossy, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom throughout the year in warm climates. Its unique foliage and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening. Medinilla peltata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture to maintain its lush appearance."
