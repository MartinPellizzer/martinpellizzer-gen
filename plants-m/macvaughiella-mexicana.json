It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes milkweeds and related genera. The plant is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white flowers that appear in the early morning and close by midday. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water in its harsh environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species."
