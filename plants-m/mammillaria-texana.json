    "intro": "Mammillaria texana, commonly known as the Texas hedgehog cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the United States, particularly Texas and New Mexico. It typically grows to a height of 10 to 20 centimeters and has a globular or cylindrical shape. The plant features numerous white to pale green tubercles, which are small, rounded bumps covered in fine, white hairs. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, emerging from the areoles between the tubercles. Mammillaria texana is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems and thriving in full sun with minimal water."
