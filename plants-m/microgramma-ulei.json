    "intro": "Microgramma ulei, commonly known as the silver fern, is a small evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are covered in a fine, silvery coating, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds. Microgramma ulei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
