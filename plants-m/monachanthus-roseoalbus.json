It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, which includes many showy and often toxic flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its distinctive helmet-shaped flowers, which are typically blue or purple with a white throat. Its leaves are palmately divided, giving it a fern-like appearance, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
