    "intro": "Markea sturmii, commonly known as the Sturm's markea, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in temperate climates. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, Markea sturmii is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in the wild."
