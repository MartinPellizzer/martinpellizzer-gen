    "intro": "Maba lanceolata, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and fragrant, yellowish wood. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in humid, tropical climates. Its bark and leaves contain essential oils, which have been used traditionally for their aromatic and medicinal properties. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
