    "intro": "Myristica pumila, commonly known as the dwarf nutmeg tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, orange-red berries. The plant produces a seed enclosed in a hard, aromatic shell, similar to the nutmeg of its larger relative, Myristica fragrans. Myristica pumila is typically found in lowland rainforests and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it a unique and valuable species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
