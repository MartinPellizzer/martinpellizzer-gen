    "intro": "Monstera expilata, commonly known as the Swiss cheese plant, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, lobed leaves that develop distinctive holes as they mature. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Its aerial roots allow it to climb and support itself as it grows. Monstera expilata is popular as a houseplant due to its striking foliage and air-purifying qualities."
