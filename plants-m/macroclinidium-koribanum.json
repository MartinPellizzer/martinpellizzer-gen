    "intro": "Macroclinidium koribanum, commonly known as the Koriba sand tree, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is a small, deciduous tree that typically grows in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The Koriba sand tree plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
