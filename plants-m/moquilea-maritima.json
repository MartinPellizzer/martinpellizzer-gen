    "intro": "Moquilea maritima, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of South America. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along the shores of Chile and Peru. The plant features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are typically broad and waxy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Moquilea maritima plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
