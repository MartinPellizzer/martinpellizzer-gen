    "intro": "Myrcia areolata, commonly known as the areola myrtle, is a shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its aromatic, glossy leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, red, berry-like fruits that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal regions. Myrcia areolata is valued for its ornamental qualities and has traditional uses in local medicine."
