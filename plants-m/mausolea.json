    "intro": "Mausolea, commonly known as the grand tombs of ancient civilizations, are not plants but monumental structures. However, the term may be confused with the genus Mausolea, which refers to certain species of flowering plants. These plants typically feature showy, colorful flowers and are often found in tropical and subtropical regions. They are characterized by their robust stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The botanical significance of Mausolea lies in their ornamental value and their role in traditional horticulture."
