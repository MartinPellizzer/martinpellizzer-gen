    "intro": "Mandevilla moritziana, commonly known as the orange mandevilla, is a tropical vine native to South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of vibrant orange flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its showy blooms and vigorous growth habit. Mandevilla moritziana is also valued for its ability to climb and can be trained on trellises or fences."
