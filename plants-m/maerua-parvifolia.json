    "intro": "Maerua parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved maerua, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its woody stems are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Maerua parvifolia is well adapted to drought and can thrive in poor soils, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
