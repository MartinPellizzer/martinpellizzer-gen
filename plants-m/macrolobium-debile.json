    "intro": "Macrolobium debile, commonly known as the weak-lobed orchid, is a small, delicate orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are short-lived but attract various pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
