    "intro": "Medicago nigra var. denticulata, commonly known as the denticulate black medic, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark purple to black flowers and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, disturbed sites, and along roadsides. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. The variety is distinguished by its finely toothed leaflets and smaller, more compact inflorescences compared to the typical form."
