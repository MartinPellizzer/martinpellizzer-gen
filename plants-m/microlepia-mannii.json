    "intro": "Microlepia mannii, commonly known as the African chain fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are often used in ornamental horticulture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate, while its spore-producing structures are located on the undersides of its leaves. Microlepia mannii is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is sometimes cultivated for decorative purposes in gardens."
