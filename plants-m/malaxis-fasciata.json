    "intro": "Malaxis fasciata, commonly known as the banded orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and linear, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers clustered in a raceme, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Malaxis fasciata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage."
