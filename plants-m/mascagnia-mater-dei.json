    "intro": "Mascagnia mater-dei, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades such as tomatoes and peppers. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its leaves are typically narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The fruit is a red, fleshy berry that ripens in the fall and contains seeds within its pulp."
