    "intro": "Myrtoleucodendron microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved myrtle-leaved tree, is a rare and endemic species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage with small, leathery leaves that have a distinct waxy texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in clusters during the wet season. Its botanical structure includes a sturdy, branching stem with a smooth, greyish bark. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and has limited ecological and horticultural significance due to its restricted distribution."
