    "intro": "Mimosa foliolosa var. pachycarpa, commonly known as the thick-fruited sensitive plant, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. Its stems are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. This variant is notable for its robust growth and adaptability to a range of environmental conditions."
