    "intro": "Melaleuca phellosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels away in thin, papery layers, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, bottlebrush-like flowers that are typically red or pink, which appear in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slight waxy coating, and it is often found in coastal or sandy soils. Melaleuca phellosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional Aboriginal medicine."
