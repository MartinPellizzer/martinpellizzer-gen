    "intro": "Melica \u00d7 thuringiaca subsp. chrysolepis, commonly known as golden beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikelets that are loosely arranged, with pale yellow to golden bracts that give it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically valuable component of its native habitats."
