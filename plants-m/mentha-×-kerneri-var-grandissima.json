    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 kerneri var. grandissima, commonly known as the giant hybrid mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Mentha \u00d7 villosa and Mentha \u00d7 piperita. This plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring square stems and opposite, serrated leaves. The leaves are aromatic, with a strong menthol scent, and the plant produces small, pale purple flowers in whorled clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
