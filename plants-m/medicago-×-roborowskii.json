It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it resilient to drought conditions. It plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. This species is also valued for its use in forage and as a cover crop in agricultural systems."
