    "intro": "Microcerasus tomentosa f. batalinii, commonly known as the Batalin's woolly cotoneaster, is a compact, shrub-like plant characterized by its dense, velvety foliage. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardiness. This form is a natural variant of the species, exhibiting slight differences in leaf texture and growth habit compared to the typical form."
