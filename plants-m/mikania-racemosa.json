    "intro": "Mikania racemosa, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the morning. Its rapid growth and ability to climb or trail make it a common ornamental and invasive species in many regions. The seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
