    "intro": "Mimosa psilocarpa, commonly known as the sacred mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, and its seeds are encased in hairy, pod-like structures. It is notable for containing psychoactive compounds, particularly psilocybin, which have been used in traditional ceremonial practices. Due to its hallucinogenic properties, it is also considered a controlled substance in many regions."
