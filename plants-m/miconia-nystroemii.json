    "intro": "Miconia nystroemii, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit, is a tropical shrub native to South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by small, round fruits that resemble starfruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
