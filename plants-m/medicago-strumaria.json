    "intro": "Medicago strumaria, commonly known as the common vetch, is an annual legume native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features trifoliate leaves with a distinctive heart-shaped base and produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers. The plant is characterized by its sprawling growth habit and the presence of tendrils that aid in climbing. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Medicago strumaria has been used historically in agriculture as a green manure and for its nitrogen-fixing abilities."
