It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves, which are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flower heads that bloom in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to various environmental conditions. Due to its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
