    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum tuberosum, commonly known as the African daisy, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable in native landscapes."
