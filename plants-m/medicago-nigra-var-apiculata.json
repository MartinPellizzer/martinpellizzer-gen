    "intro": "Medicago nigra var. apiculata, commonly known as black medic with an apiculate leaf tip, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with a sharp, pointed tip on the terminal leaflet, distinguishing it from other varieties. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by cylindrical, dehiscent pods containing several seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along fences. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration and as a forage plant."
