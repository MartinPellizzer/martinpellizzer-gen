    "intro": "Mespilus xanthocarpa, commonly known as the yellow medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, fragrant flowers that appear in late spring. The plant produces edible fruits that are typically harvested in autumn, though they are often too astringent to eat raw. The leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and the bark is smooth and grayish in color. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
