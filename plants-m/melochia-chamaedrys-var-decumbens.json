    "intro": "Melochia chamaedrys var. decumbens, commonly known as the prostrate melochia, is a low-growing shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features sprawling, decumbent stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its leaves are heart-shaped, with a glossy surface and a slightly serrated margin. This species is often used in ornamental gardening for its dense, ground-covering growth habit."
