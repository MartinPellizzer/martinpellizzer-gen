    "intro": "Moquinia, commonly known as the moquinia grass or moquinia sedge, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cyperaceae. These plants are typically found in wetland environments, such as marshes and swamps, where they thrive in moist to aquatic conditions. Moquinia species are characterized by their grass-like appearance, with narrow leaves and small, clustered flowers. They play an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. Due to their preference for wet conditions, they are often used in ecological restoration projects."
