    "intro": "Mastixia langbianensis, commonly known as the Langbian mastixia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes plants such as cashews and sumacs. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its fruit is a drupe, containing a single seed surrounded by a fleshy pulp. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Mastixia langbianensis is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
