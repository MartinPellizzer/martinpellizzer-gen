    "intro": "Melanolepis calcosa, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, reducing water loss through transpiration. Melanolepis calcosa is adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy plant in dry climates."
