    "intro": "Melanchrysum, commonly known as the \"sad plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to yellow and orange. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and thrives in well-drained soil. Melanchrysum species are often found in meadows and along woodland edges. Its botanical name reflects its historical association with melancholy, though it is primarily valued for its ornamental beauty."
