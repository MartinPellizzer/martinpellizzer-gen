    "intro": "Mikania nummularia, commonly known as dollarweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically 1 to 3 inches in diameter, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by fluffy, white seeds that are easily dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and invasive tendencies make it a common weed in gardens and natural areas."
