It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in sandy or well-drained soils. Due to its delicate appearance and responsive leaves, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
