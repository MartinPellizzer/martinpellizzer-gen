    "intro": "Mezia crassiramea, commonly known as the thick-stemmed mezia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features a robust, woody stem that is covered in dense, fibrous hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a bluish-gray hue due to a thick layer of trichomes. The flowers are small, clustered in racemes, and typically have four petals, contributing to its ornamental value in botanical gardens."
