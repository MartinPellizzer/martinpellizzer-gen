    "intro": "Mammillaria tinuvieliae, commonly known as the Mexican snowball cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and is covered in white to pale blue spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
