    "intro": "Muscari argaei f. album, commonly known as the white musk orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces a bulbous structure that stores nutrients, allowing it to survive in harsh alpine conditions. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from the base of the plant. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
