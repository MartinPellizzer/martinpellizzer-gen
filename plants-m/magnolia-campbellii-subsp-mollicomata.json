    "intro": "Magnolia campbellii subsp. mollicomata, commonly known as the Campbell's magnolia, is a rare and ornamental tree native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its large, fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves appear. The leaves are broad, ovate, and have a smooth, leathery texture, providing a striking contrast to the showy blossoms. This subspecies is known for its slow growth and cold hardiness, making it suitable for temperate climates. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and its role in the study of magnolia evolution and taxonomy."
