    "intro": "Medicago rotata var. longispina, commonly known as the long-spined red clover, is a variant of the red clover species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial legume characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant is notable for its distinctive, elongated spines on the pods, which give it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Medicago rotata var. longispina is valued for its role in soil nitrogen fixation and as a forage crop for livestock."
