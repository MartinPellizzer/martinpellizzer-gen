    "intro": "Maranta illustris, commonly known as the prayer plant, is a tropical flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, ornate leaves that fold upwards at night, a behavior known as nyctinasty. The plant belongs to the Marantaceae family and is prized for its vibrant foliage, often featuring patterns of red, silver, and green. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Maranta illustris is popular as a houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
