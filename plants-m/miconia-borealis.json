    "intro": "Miconia borealis, commonly known as the northern miconia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in cool, moist environments, often in cloud forests. The plant features large, broad leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to retain moisture. Its flowers are showy, with bright yellow petals and numerous stamens, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Miconia borealis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
