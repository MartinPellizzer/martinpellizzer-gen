It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. The plant features slender, grass-like blades with a distinctive ciliate (fringed) edge along the leaf margins. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet per stem, which is a characteristic feature of the varietal name \"uniflora.\" The species is often noted for its ecological importance in supporting pollinators and maintaining soil stability in its native environments."
