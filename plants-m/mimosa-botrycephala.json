    "intro": "Mimosa botrycephala, commonly known as the globular mimosa, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its unique globular shape and compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response known as thigmonasty. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in spherical clusters, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
