    "intro": "Miconia tonduzii var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter, often with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain regions."
