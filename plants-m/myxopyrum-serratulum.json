It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage with finely serrated edges, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and pond margins. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, cylindrical seed heads. Its ecological value lies in providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
