    "intro": "Macodes limii, commonly known as the velvet tana wood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown to black bark and glossy, dark green elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red berries. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden environments. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
