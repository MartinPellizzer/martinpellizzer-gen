    "intro": "Mitella caulescens f. tonsa, commonly known as the tufted mitella, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit with hairy stems. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
