    "intro": "Myosurus minimus subsp. novae-zelandiae, commonly known as the New Zealand mossy orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, moss-like growth habit and produces tiny, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky areas. It has a sympodial growth pattern, with each shoot forming a new rosette of leaves. Its botanical features make it an important species for studying orchid diversity in the region."
