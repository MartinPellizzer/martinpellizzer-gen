    "intro": "Macrocatalpa longissima, commonly known as the longleaf catalpa, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white down. The tree produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in the spring, which are typically pale yellow or white. Its fruit is a long, slender pod that splits open to release seeds. The longleaf catalpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in timber production."
