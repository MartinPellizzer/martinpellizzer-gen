It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and opposite, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which are followed by follicles containing numerous seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in shaded, moist environments. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
