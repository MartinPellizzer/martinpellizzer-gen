    "intro": "Medicago suffruticosa var. villosa, commonly known as the woolly medick, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and hairy stems, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its trifoliate leaves are covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. As a nitrogen-fixing plant, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
