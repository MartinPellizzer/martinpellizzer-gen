    "intro": "Mimosa dolens subsp. eriophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mimosa, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, yellow flower heads that resemble those of other mimosa species. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is well adapted to arid environments. It produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
