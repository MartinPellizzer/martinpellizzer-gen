It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are grass-like, narrow, and evergreen, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens.
