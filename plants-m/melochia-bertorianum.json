It is characterized by its palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, often with a reddish underside. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in terminal clusters. Its roots are thick and fleshy, which help it store water in arid environments. Melochia bertorianum is native to regions of Central and South America and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides."
