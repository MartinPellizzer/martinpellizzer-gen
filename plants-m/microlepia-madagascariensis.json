    "intro": "Microlepia madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascar sword fern, is a terrestrial fern native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its sword-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces both sterile and fertile fronds, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture."
