    "intro": "Mimosa denisii, commonly known as the Denis's sensitive plant, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its sensitive leaf response, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
