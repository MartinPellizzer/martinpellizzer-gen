    "intro": "Myosotis palustris var. laxiflora, commonly known as the marsh forget-me-not, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Europe. It features slender stems that often lie prostrate or form dense mats, with small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to thrive in moist, often boggy soils. This variety is distinguished by its more loosely arranged flowers compared to the typical form of Myosotis palustris. It plays an important ecological role in wetland habitats by stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
