    "intro": "Melanoseris lessertiana, commonly known as the lesser seris, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as grasslands and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cooler, temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers consist of both ray and disk florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
