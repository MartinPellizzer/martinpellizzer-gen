It is a member of the Convolvulaceae family, characterized by its rapid growth and twining stems. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, blooming in the morning and closing by midday. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, berry-like capsule. Mikania jeffreyi is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and dry slopes, where it can thrive in full sun."
