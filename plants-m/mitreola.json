These plants are typically small, herbaceous, and often have a compact growth habit. They are characterized by their small, usually yellow or white flowers and berries that can be toxic. Mitreola species are native to various regions in the Americas, particularly in tropical and subtropical areas. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine, though caution is advised due to their potentially harmful properties."
