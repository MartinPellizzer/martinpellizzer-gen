It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Meiogyne lecardii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
