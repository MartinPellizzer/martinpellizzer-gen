    "intro": "Musa arunachalensis, commonly known as the Arunachal banana, is a species of banana native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its large, elongated leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant thrives in moist, tropical climates and is often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its fruit, while edible, is typically smaller and less sweet compared to commercial banana varieties. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique genetic makeup and potential for agricultural use."
