    "intro": "Mimosa eriocarpa, commonly known as the woolly mimosa, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its soft, grayish-white pubescence covering the stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spherical seed pods that turn from green to brown as they mature. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of multiple pairs of small, feather-like leaflets. Mimosa eriocarpa is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and desert scrub habitats."
