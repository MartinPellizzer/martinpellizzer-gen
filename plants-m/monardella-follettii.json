    "intro": "Monardella follettii, commonly known as California paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its showy, brush-like inflorescences that range in color from pink to red. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants while also performing photosynthesis. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, often found in California and Oregon. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in some areas."
