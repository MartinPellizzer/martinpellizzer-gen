    "intro": "Micrandra lopezii var. microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited micrandra, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cactaceae. It is characterized by its compact, spiny stems and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is native to arid regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its stems to adapt to its harsh environment. The fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains seeds, aiding in its dispersal by animals."
