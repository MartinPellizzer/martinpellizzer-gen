It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes other gourds and cucumbers. The plant produces yellow flowers and elongated, bitter fruits that are typically harvested when immature. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are hairy and often trailing. The plant is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and is often grown for its edible fruits, though they are generally less commonly consumed than other bitter melon varieties."
