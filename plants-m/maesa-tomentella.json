    "intro": "Maesa tomentella, commonly known as the woolly maesa, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a fluffy appearance. The plant has small, ovate leaves with a waxy texture and a distinct grayish-white pubescence. It produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal."
