It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in heads, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in disturbed areas and along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
