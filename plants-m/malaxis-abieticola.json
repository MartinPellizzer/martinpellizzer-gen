    "intro": "Malaxis abieticola, commonly known as the pine needle orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often among pine and fir forests. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption. Malaxis abieticola is a relatively rare and specialized orchid, with limited geographic distribution."
