    "intro": "Mariscus unifolius, commonly known as the single-leaf marsh plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and a single, lance-shaped leaf that arises from the base. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers in late summer, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. Mariscus unifolius thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic insects."
