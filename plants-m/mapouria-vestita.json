    "intro": "Mapouria vestita, commonly known as the velvet maple, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and distinctive, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by samaroid fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in warm regions."
