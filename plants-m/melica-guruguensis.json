    "intro": "Melica guruguensis, commonly known as the Guruguensian grass, is a perennial grass species native to the highland regions of eastern Africa. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in temperate to cool climates. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spikelet cluster, which is a common feature among many grass species. Melica guruguensis is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations."
