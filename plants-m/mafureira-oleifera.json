It is characterized by its large, bipinnate leaves and produces long, cylindrical pods containing oily seeds. The plant is valued for its high oil content, which is used in both culinary and industrial applications. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. The tree also plays an important role in agroforestry systems due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
