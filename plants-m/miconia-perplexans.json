    "intro": "Miconia perplexans, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a problematic species in certain regions."
