    "intro": "Microlaena gunnii, commonly known as the narrow-leafed grass or Gunns' grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 mm wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. Microlaena gunnii is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native fauna."
