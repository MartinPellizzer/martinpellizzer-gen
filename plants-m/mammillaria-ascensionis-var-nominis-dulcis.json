    "intro": "Mammillaria ascensionis var. nominis-dulcis, commonly known as the sweet name mammillaria, is a compact cactus native to the Canary Islands. It features a globular stem covered in white to pale blue tubercles, which are adorned with short, white spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its gray-green body. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in horticulture."
