    "intro": "Miconia antillana subsp. antillana, commonly known as the Caribbean miconia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean region. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale green flowers that are often followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain areas."
