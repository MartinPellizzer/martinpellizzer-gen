    "intro": "Melampyrum laxum f. edentatum, commonly known as the toothless yellow rattle, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. It grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges, often in areas with acidic soils. This subspecies is distinguished by the absence of teeth on its leaf margins, giving it its common name."
