    "intro": "Microsorum novae-zealandiae, commonly known as the New Zealand water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its rhizomes form a dense mat on the water's surface, which helps to stabilize the substrate. The plant is often used in aquascaping due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide habitat for small aquatic organisms."
