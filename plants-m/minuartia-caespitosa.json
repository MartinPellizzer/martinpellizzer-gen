    "intro": "Minuartia caespitosa, commonly known as the tufted rockcress, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous and tundra environments. The plant features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates. Minuartia caespitosa is also known for its ability to form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in its native habitats."
