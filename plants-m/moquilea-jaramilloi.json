    "intro": "Moquilea jaramilloi, commonly known as the Jaramillo's moquilea, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding structure, typical of bromeliads. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often in vibrant colors that attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from environmental changes and habitat loss."
