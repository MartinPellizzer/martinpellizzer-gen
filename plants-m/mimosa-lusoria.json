    "intro": "Mimosa lusoria, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a deciduous shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by the plant's sensitive leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to elongated, woody pods containing edible seeds. Its bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth."
