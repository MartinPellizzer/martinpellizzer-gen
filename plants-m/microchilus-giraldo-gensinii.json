    "intro": "Microchilus giraldo-gensinii, commonly known as the Giraldo's ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its slender, arching fronds with a pale green coloration. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture to flourish. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of its leaves, a typical feature of many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
