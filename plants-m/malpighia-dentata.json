    "intro": "Malpighia dentata, commonly known as the strawberry tree, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with serrated edges, which give it the species name *dentata*. The plant produces small, bright red fruits that resemble strawberries, though they are not related to true strawberries. These fruits are edible, sweet, and often used in culinary applications. Malpighia dentata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
