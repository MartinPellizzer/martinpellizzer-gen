    "intro": "Macrolearia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf macrolearia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
