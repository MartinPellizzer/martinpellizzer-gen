    "intro": "Molinia arundinacea, commonly known as moor grass, is a perennial grass species native to moist, acidic habitats such as bogs and heathlands. It forms dense clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and have a bluish tint. The plant produces spikelets that are often reddish or brownish, with small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Molinia arundinacea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in landscaping."
