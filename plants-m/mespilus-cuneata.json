    "intro": "Mespilus cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe. It features simple, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often gland-dotted on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by fleshy, edible berries that ripen in autumn. Its fruit has a unique, somewhat fermented flavor and has been historically used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
