    "intro": "Macaranga nicobarica, commonly known as the Nicobar mallow, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas, it plays a significant role in ecological succession."
