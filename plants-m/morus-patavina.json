    "intro": "Morus patavina, commonly known as the white mulberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically pale green to white in color, which distinguish it from other mulberry species. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits called syconia, which are typically pink or red when mature. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its fruit and as a host plant for silkworms. The white mulberry is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
