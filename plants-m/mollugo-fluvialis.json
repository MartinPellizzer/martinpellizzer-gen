    "intro": "Mollugo fluvialis, commonly known as the river moss or water spurry, is a low-growing annual herb native to wetland and aquatic environments. It features small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to waterlogged conditions. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind or insects. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize soil in riparian zones. Mollugo fluvialis is often found in marshes, along riverbanks, and in other moist habitats where it thrives in the presence of standing or flowing water."
