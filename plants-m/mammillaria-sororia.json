    "intro": "Mammillaria sororia, commonly known as the Mexican night-blooming cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and pale green to blue-gray stems. The plant features small, white spines and produces showy, pink to purple flowers during the evening. It is well adapted to arid environments, with thick, water-storing stems and a shallow root system. Mammillaria sororia is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal."
