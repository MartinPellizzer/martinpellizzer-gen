    "intro": "Melicope madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascar melicope, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by round, fleshy fruits that are typically yellow or orange when mature. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests or secondary growth areas. Due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
