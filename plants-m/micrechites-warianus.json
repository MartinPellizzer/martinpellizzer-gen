It is a small, epiphytic orchid that typically grows on tree bark in tropical rainforests. The plant has a slender, wiry stem with a few leaves and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
