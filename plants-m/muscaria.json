    "intro": "Muscaria, commonly known as the fly agaric, is a species of psychoactive mushroom belonging to the genus *Amanita*. It is characterized by its distinctive red cap covered in white warts and a white stem with a bulbous base. The fruiting bodies typically emerge in woodland areas, especially in temperate regions during late summer and autumn. The mushroom contains psychoactive compounds such as muscimol and ibotenic acid, which affect the central nervous system. Due to its toxicity, it is important to distinguish it from edible mushrooms to avoid poisoning."
