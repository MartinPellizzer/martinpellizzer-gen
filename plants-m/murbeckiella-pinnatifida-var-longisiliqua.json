    "intro": "Murbeckiella pinnatifida var. longisiliqua, commonly known as the long-silique bellflower, is a herbaceous plant characterized by its finely divided, pinnately arranged leaves. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant's most distinctive feature is its long, slender silique fruits that elongate throughout the growing season. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
