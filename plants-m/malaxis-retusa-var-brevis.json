    "intro": "Malaxis retusa var. brevis, commonly known as the short-stemmed marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to moist, shaded environments in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and slender, often hairy stems. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in loose inflorescences. Its leaves are usually lanceolate and arranged in a rosette at the base of the stem. This orchid is adapted to wetland habitats and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native ecosystems."
