It is characterized by its showy, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The flowers are typically white or pale pink and are borne in clusters along the branches. The leaves are oval and have a smooth texture, turning yellow in the fall. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its early spring blossoms."
