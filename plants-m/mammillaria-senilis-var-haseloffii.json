It features a globular or slightly columnar stem with white, woolly spines that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
