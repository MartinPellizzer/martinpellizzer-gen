    "intro": "Mollugo glinus var. lotoides, commonly known as the small yellow cranesbill, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to June. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors. It is often found in association with other ground-covering plants in humid, temperate climates. The species is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion."
