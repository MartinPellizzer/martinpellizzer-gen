    "intro": "Microcoelia pachystemma, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed microcoelia, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and daisy-like appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its narrow, upright stems are covered in fine, hairy foliage, and it produces small yellow flowers in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
