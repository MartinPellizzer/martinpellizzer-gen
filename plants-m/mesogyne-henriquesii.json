    "intro": "Mesogyne henriquesii, commonly known as the Henriques' mesogyne, is a small evergreen shrub native to the humid forests of western Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a glossy green surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, which bloom during the rainy season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Mesogyne henriquesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens for its foliage and seasonal flowering."
