It features small, trifoliate leaves and produces yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed or arid environments. It is valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage crop for livestock. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to drought and nutrient-poor conditions."
