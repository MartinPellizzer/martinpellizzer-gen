    "intro": "Madhuca lecomtei, commonly known as the Lecomte's mahogany, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and large, elliptical leaves. The tree produces yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible, fleshy fruits containing a single seed. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction. However, due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
