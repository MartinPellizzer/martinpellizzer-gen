It is characterized by its large, showy blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features a thick, fleshy stem and large, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes.
