    "intro": "Mikania lanigera, commonly known as the hairy Mikania, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and heart-shaped, palmate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences. Its fruits are small, dry, and three-lobed, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Mikania lanigera is often found in disturbed habitats, such as roadsides and forest edges, and is considered an invasive species in some areas."
