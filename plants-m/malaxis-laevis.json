    "intro": "Malaxis laevis, commonly known as the smooth malaxis, is a species of orchid native to parts of Asia and Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. Malaxis laevis is a terrestrial orchid that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, highlighting its ecological interdependence."
