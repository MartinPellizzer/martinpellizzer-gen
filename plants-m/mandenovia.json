    "intro": "Mandenovia, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its attractive, velvety leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a compact shrub or herb, often with a rosette of leaves at the base. Mandenovia species are popular in horticulture due to their vibrant flower colors and ability to thrive in indoor environments. They prefer bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
