    "intro": "Mimulus karakormianus, commonly known as the Karakoram monkeyflower, is a species of flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Karakoram Mountains in Pakistan. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces striking, bright orange to yellow tubular flowers, which are adapted for pollination by hummingbirds and other nectar-feeding insects. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Mimulus karakormianus is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited geographic distribution."
