    "intro": "Melaleuca plumea, commonly known as the silky paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous, papery inner layer. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, which bloom during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a soft, feathery appearance. Melaleuca plumea is often found in coastal and wetland areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun."
