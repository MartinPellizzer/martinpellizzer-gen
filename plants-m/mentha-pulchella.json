It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in whorls along the stems, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Mentha pulchella is a member of the Lamiaceae family, sharing characteristics such as square stems and aromatic foliage with other mints. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks."
