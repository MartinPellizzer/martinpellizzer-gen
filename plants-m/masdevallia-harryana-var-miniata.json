    "intro": "Masdevallia harryana var. miniata, commonly known as the miniature masdevallia, is a terrestrial orchid native to the cloud forests of South America. It features slender, wiry stems and compact, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a dark green color. The flowers are small and delicate, with a unique coloration pattern that includes red and purple markings on white petals. It thrives in cool, humid conditions with high light exposure but requires careful watering to avoid root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements compared to other masdevallia species."
