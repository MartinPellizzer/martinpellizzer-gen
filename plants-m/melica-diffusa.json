    "intro": "Melica diffusa, commonly known as the soft brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with green or purple. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Melica diffusa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
