It features upright, hairy stems and heart-shaped, serrated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, tubular red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy addition to native gardens. Its low-growing habit and vibrant floral display make it a valuable plant for ecological and ornamental purposes."
