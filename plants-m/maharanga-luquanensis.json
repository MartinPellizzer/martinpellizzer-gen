    "intro": "Maharanga luquanensis, commonly known as the Luquan maharanga, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires protection to ensure its survival."
