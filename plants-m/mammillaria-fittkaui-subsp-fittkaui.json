    "intro": "Mammillaria fittkaui subsp. fittkaui, commonly known as the Fittkau's mammillaria, is a small, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a compact, rounded stem with a woolly coating and spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
