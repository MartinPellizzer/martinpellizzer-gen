    "intro": "Mysanthus, commonly known as the Chinese lantern plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its showy, lantern-shaped bracts that enclose the small, inconspicuous flowers. These bracts are often brightly colored, ranging from red to orange, and serve to attract pollinators. The plant is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, and thrives in warm, humid climates. Mysanthus species are often cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
