    "intro": "Marsdenia umbellata, commonly known as the umbellate Marsdenia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its climbing habit and fleshy, angular stems. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by distinctive, hairy seed pods. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat. Marsdenia umbellata is valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
