It is characterized by its square stems, opposite leaves, and aromatic, often minty-scented foliage. The plant typically grows in moist environments such as stream banks, wet meadows, and marshes. It produces small, pale blue or violet flowers in whorled clusters, which are borne on tall, slender spikes. Mentha \u00d7 verticillata is closely related to other mint species and is often used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb."
