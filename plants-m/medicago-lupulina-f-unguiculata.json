    "intro": "Medicago lupulina f. unguiculata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sainfoin, is a perennial legume characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with narrowly elliptical leaflets. It produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant is adapted to dry, alkaline soils and is often found in steppe and grassland habitats. Its trifoliate leaves and distinctive floral structure contribute to its botanical classification and ecological role. It is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and use in forage and soil conservation."
