    "intro": "Mammea cerasifera, commonly known as the Java apple or red mangosteen, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its smooth, grey bark and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, round fruits with a thick, pinkish rind. The fruit contains a segmented, juicy pulp that is often consumed fresh or processed into various products. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests."
