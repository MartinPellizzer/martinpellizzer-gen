    "intro": "Minuartia perdita, commonly known as the lost rockcress, is a small, mat-forming flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with linear leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Native to arctic and alpine regions, it thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in high-altitude environments. The plant is adapted to cold climates and has a short growing season. Its limited distribution and specialized habitat make it a rare and ecologically significant species."
