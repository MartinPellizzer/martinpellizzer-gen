    "intro": "Myosotis verna var. macrosperma, commonly known as the spring forget-me-not, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a hairy texture, while its stems are slender and often arching. This variety is notable for its larger seeds compared to other forms of Myosotis verna."
