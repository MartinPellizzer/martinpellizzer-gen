    "intro": "Melanium fruticosum, commonly known as the coastal morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a trailing perennial vine that produces trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and purple. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are woody and sprawling. Melanium fruticosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
