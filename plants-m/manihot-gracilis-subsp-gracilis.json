    "intro": "Manihot gracilis subsp. gracilis, commonly known as the slender arrowleaf manioc, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, arrow-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is adapted to grow in moist, tropical environments and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its fibrous roots, it has been traditionally used for its starchy tubers, though it is less economically significant compared to other manioc species."
