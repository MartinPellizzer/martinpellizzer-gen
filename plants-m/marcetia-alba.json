    "intro": "Marcetia alba, commonly known as the white marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in Europe. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense basal cluster. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found near water bodies. Marcetia alba plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
