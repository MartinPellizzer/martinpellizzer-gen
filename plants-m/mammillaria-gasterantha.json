    "intro": "Mammillaria gasterantha, commonly known as the \"Horned Cactus,\" is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and is covered in small, white tubercles that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which bloom from areoles located near the top of the stem. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-draining soil with bright, indirect light. Mammillaria gasterantha is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts due to its unique look and relatively easy care requirements."
