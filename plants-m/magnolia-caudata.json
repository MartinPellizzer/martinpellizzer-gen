    "intro": "Magnolia caudata, commonly known as the cucumber tree, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It features large, showy, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The tree has smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and often have a waxy texture. The fruit is a long, cylindrical follicle that splits open to release winged seeds. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also important in ecological systems as a food source for various wildlife species."
