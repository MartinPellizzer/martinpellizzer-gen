    "intro": "Manihot alcicornis, commonly known as the horned arrowleaf, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Its roots are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though it is not as widely cultivated as other manioc species. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial shade."
