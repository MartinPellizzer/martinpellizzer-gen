    "intro": "Miconia trichosantha, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a dark purple drupe that contains a single seed. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, Miconia trichosantha is considered a problematic species in some regions."
