    "intro": "Machaeranthera tephrodes, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Machaeranthera tephrodes is also known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
