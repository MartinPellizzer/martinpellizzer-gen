    "intro": "Mimosa peregrina, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous species native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellow, globular flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and educational settings. Its unique sensitivity to touch makes it an interesting subject for botanical study and public engagement."
