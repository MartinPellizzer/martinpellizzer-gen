    "intro": "Machilus attenuatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Chinese laurel, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by oval, woody fruits that contain one or two seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Machilus attenuatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine."
