    "intro": "Mertensia cana, commonly known as bluebells, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its striking clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Mertensia cana is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance as a food source for pollinators."
