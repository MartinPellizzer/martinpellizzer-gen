    "intro": "Melampodium repens, commonly known as the creeping goldenweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southern United States. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with a distinctive orange center, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Melampodium repens is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as sandy soils and disturbed areas."
