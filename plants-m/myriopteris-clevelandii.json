    "intro": "Myriopteris clevelandii, commonly known as Cleveland's huperzia, is a species of clubmoss native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, scale-like leaves that are tightly clustered. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its sporophytes produce spores in capsules that are clustered at the tips of the stems. Myriopteris clevelandii is an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitat."
