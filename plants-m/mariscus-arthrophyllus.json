    "intro": "Mariscus arthrophyllus, commonly known as the silverleaf mariscus, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in dense, fine hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly succulent texture, adapting to arid environments. Mariscus arthrophyllus is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
