It is native to East Asia, particularly Taiwan, and is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers. Microstegium formosanum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its ecological role includes providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to soil stabilization in its native range."
