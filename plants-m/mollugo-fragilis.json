    "intro": "Mollugo fragilis, commonly known as the fragile mossy pebble, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in moist, sandy soils. It is characterized by its small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant is often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Mollugo fragilis is a member of the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is known for its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
