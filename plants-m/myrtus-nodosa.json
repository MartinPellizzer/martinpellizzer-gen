    "intro": "Myrtus nodosa, commonly known as the dwarf myrtle, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, aromatic leaves that are often fragrant and have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces tiny, white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by small, dark blue berries. Myrtus nodosa is well-suited for coastal areas due to its tolerance of salt spray and well-drained soils. Its dense growth habit makes it an excellent choice for hedges or as a decorative plant in gardens."
