    "intro": "Marcgravia nepenthoides, commonly known as the \"false Venus flytrap,\" is a tropical epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique, pitcher-like leaves that resemble those of *Nepenthes* species. The plant's leaves are covered in fine, sticky hairs that aid in trapping insects, which are then digested by the plant's secreted enzymes. It thrives in high humidity and bright, indirect light, often growing on trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Marcgravia nepenthoides is a popular specimen among carnivorous plant enthusiasts due to its striking appearance and specialized adaptations."
