    "intro": "Melastoma bibracteatum, commonly known as the small-leaved melastoma, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a shrub characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Melastoma bibracteatum is often found in moist, shaded forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
