    "intro": "Melanthera elliptica, commonly known as the narrowleaf false nettle, is a herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Melanthera elliptica is characterized by its lack of stinging hairs, distinguishing it from true nettles."
