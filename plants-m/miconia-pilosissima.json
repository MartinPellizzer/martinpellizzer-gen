    "intro": "Miconia pilosissima, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, dark berries as fruit. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain regions."
