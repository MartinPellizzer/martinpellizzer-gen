    "intro": "Melica harfordii var. minor, commonly known as Harford\u2019s meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along streams. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with green to purplish flowers. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which helps it spread and establish in wetland environments. Botanically, it is part of the Poaceae family and is often found in association with other wetland flora."
