It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its lanceolate, glossy leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces woody capsules that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of interest for its potential ecological and medicinal value."
