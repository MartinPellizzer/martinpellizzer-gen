It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in terminal spikes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions. Its silvery foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and erosion control."
