    "intro": "Maianthemum forrestii, commonly known as the Forster's false lily of the valley, is a low-growing, evergreen perennial native to the eastern United States. It features dark green, strap-like leaves that form a dense rosette near the ground. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are clustered in a raceme. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its foliage remains attractive throughout the growing season, making it a valuable addition to woodland gardens."
