It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves. The tree produces smooth, green fruits that mature to a yellowish-orange color, containing a sweet, sticky pulp. Its bark is thick and fissured, often exuding a milky sap when wounded. This plant is valued for its timber, which is hard and durable, as well as its edible fruit."
