    "intro": "Minuartia viscosa, commonly known as sticky rock-cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and arid environments. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and segmented fruits. The plant's leaves are typically succulent and covered with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its sticky secretions on the leaves and stems serve as a natural defense against herbivores and environmental stress."
