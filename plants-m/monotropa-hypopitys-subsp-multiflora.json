    "intro": "Monotropa hypopitys subsp. multiflora, commonly known as the ghost plant or Indian tobacco, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host trees for nutrients. It is native to eastern North America and is often found in shaded, forested environments. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which help it obtain nutrients from the host tree. This species is also noted for its unique ability to produce a mild narcotic effect when consumed."
