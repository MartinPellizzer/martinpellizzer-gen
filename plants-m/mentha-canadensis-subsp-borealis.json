    "intro": "Mentha canadensis subsp. borealis, commonly known as northern mint, is a perennial herb native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in whorled clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its essential oils, rich in menthol, contribute to its use in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent."
