It features a compact, branched stem structure with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a slight bluish tinge. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, adding a subtle ornamental touch. Its ability to store water in its leaves makes it well adapted to arid environments.
