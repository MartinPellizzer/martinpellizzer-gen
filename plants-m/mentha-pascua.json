    "intro": "Mentha pascua, commonly known as sheep's sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features slender, upright stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Mentha pascua is known for its distinctive sour taste, which comes from the presence of oxalic acid. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
