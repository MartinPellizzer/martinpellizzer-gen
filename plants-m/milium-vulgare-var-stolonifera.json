    "intro": "Milium vulgare var. stolonifera, commonly known as the common millet grass, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers in spikelets, which are clustered in panicles. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This variety is notable for its ability to spread through stolons, forming extensive colonies in suitable habitats."
