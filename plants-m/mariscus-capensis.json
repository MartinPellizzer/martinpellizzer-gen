    "intro": "Mariscus capensis, commonly known as the Cape mariscus, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It features small, leathery, evergreen leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round, orange-red fruits. It is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for coastal gardens. The plant's unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rockeries and xeriscaping."
