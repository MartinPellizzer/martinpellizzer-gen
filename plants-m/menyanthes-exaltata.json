    "intro": "Menyanthes exaltata, commonly known as the water parsnip, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that float on the water surface or grow just above it. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, which bloom in early summer. Its root system is tuberous, and it is often found in marshes, pond edges, and slow-moving streams. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and supporting aquatic insect populations."
