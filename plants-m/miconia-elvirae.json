    "intro": "Miconia elvirae, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or red miconia, is a shrub or small tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves that are often heart-shaped or ovate. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia elvirae is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid, tropical climates. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive spread and ecological impact."
