    "intro": "Myripnois dioica, commonly known as the male and female fern, is a dioecious plant, meaning it has separate male and female plants. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant produces two types of spore-bearing leaves: the male gametophyte and the female sporophyte. Its fronds are typically slender and elongated, with a distinctive, delicate appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks."
