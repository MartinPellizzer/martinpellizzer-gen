    "intro": "Miconia koepckeana, commonly known as the golden miconia, is a striking tropical shrub or small tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting a variety of pollinators. Its fruits are bright red berries that contain numerous seeds, aiding in its dispersal by animals. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in warm climates, though it can become invasive if not managed properly."
