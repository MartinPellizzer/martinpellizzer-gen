    "intro": "Medicago denticulata subsp. lappacea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved clover, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Its adaptability makes it a useful plant in both ecological restoration and agricultural settings."
