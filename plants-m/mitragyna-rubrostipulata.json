    "intro": "Mitragyna rubrostipulata, commonly known as the red-stippled kratom, is a species of the Rubiaceae family native to Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its elliptical leaves with red veins and stipules. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by small, round fruits containing single seeds. Its botanical features make it distinct from other kratom species, particularly in leaf morphology and coloration. It is primarily found in the rainforests of Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia."
