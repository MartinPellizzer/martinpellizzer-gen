    "intro": "Macria, commonly known as the common meadow grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and elongated, narrow leaves. The flowers are typically arranged in spikelets, which are clustered in panicles, giving the plant a delicate appearance. Macria species are often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. They play an important role in soil stabilization and provide habitat for various insects and small animals."
