    "intro": "Microchaeta procumbens, commonly known as the creeping microchaeta, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant characterized by its prostrate growth habit. It typically features small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its botanical structure supports its role as a ground cover plant in ecological restoration projects."
