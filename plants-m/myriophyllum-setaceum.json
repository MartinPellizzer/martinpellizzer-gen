    "intro": "Myriophyllum setaceum, commonly known as water parsley, is a species of aquatic plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, ribbon-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in clusters at the water's surface. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize sediment in aquatic environments. Myriophyllum setaceum is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes."
