    "intro": "Monteverdia jefeana, commonly known as the Jefeana mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as the ceiba and balsa, through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often overlooked due to their inconspicuous appearance. Its berries, which are typically red or yellow, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Monteverdia jefeana plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat, contributing to nutrient cycling and providing food for certain wildlife species."
