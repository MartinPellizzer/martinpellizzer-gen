    "intro": "Mahonia pycnophylla, commonly known as the dense-leaved mahonia, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features compound leaves with a dense arrangement of small, leathery leaflets, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by blue-black berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Mahonia pycnophylla is valued for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
