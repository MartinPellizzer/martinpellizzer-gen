    "intro": "Miconia florbella, commonly known as the Florida miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter, often with a waxy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by distinctive, fleshy, purple to red berries. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage. However, it can become invasive in certain environments, outcompeting native vegetation."
