It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and melons, and is native to the Mediterranean region. The plant is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. It produces small, round fruits that are typically green when mature. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
