It is an annual herb that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring alternate, hairy, and often lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, which are followed by spiny, spherical fruits. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in fields.
