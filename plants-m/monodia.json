    "intro": "Monodia, commonly known as the \"bushy spurge,\" is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its dense, branching structure and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces a milky, latex-like sap that is toxic and can cause skin irritation. Its leaves are typically alternate, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Monodia thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields."
