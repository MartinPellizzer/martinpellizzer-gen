It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and is covered in white, woolly hairs. The plant produces pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer seasons. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant."
