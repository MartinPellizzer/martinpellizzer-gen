    "intro": "Malvastrum bakerianum f. hirsutissimum, commonly known as the woolly marshmallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its thick, hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is native to regions of southern Africa. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its hirsute (hairy) foliage and fleshy stems are adaptations that help it retain moisture in its often arid or seasonally wet habitat."
