    "intro": "Munnozia pinnatipartita, commonly known as the fringed mulefat, is a shrub native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its small, gray-green leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with poor soil conditions. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
