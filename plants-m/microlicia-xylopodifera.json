    "intro": "Microlicia xylopodifera, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown timber. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a smooth surface. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits. Due to its valuable wood, it is often harvested for its ornamental and commercial uses, though it is also threatened by habitat loss."
