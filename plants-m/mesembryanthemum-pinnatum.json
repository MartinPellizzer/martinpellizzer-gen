It is a succulent species characterized by its fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
