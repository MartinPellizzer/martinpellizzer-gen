    "intro": "Microlepia speluncae var. pyramidata, commonly known as the cave fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to subterranean environments. It thrives in dark, humid caves and is adapted to low-light conditions with its finely divided, leathery fronds. The plant's unique morphology includes a compact, pyramidal growth habit, which helps it anchor in rocky crevices. It relies on spore dispersal for reproduction, as it lacks true roots and depends on moisture from dripping water. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered an endangered species and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
