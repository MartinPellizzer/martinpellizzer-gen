    "intro": "Marsdenia brenesii, commonly known as the Brena's Marsdenia, is a climbing vine native to Central America. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by follicle fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
