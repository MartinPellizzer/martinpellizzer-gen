It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its succulent, often fleshy leaves that store water. The plant is typically found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other saline habitats. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually green or reddish and arranged in clusters. Myriogyne elatinoides plays a role in stabilizing soils in salt-affected regions and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
