    "intro": "Malpighia granitica, commonly known as the granitic acanthus, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Malpighiaceae family and is characterized by its showy, red-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. It produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible and contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Malpighia granitica is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
