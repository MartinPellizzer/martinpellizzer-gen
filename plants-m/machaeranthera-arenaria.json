    "intro": "Machaeranthera arenaria, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Loasaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as deserts and coastal dunes. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are usually hairy as well. Machaeranthera arenaria is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
