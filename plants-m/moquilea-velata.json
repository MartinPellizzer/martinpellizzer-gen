    "intro": "Moquilea velata, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and small, pale flowers that appear to shimmer in the sunlight. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, often growing in rocky or alpine regions. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Moquilea velata faces significant threats to its survival."
