    "intro": "Memora involucrata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch. It is native to the Americas and thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are often overlooked. Its seeds are encased in a hard, spiny capsule, which aids in seed dispersal. Memora involucrata is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit."
