    "intro": "Medicago rigidula var. eriocarpa, commonly known as the hairy goat's head, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in summer, followed by distinctive, inflated seed pods. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
