    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum capornii, commonly known as the Cape gooseberry or oro blanco, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, thick leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit, which resembles a small, round tomato, is edible and has a tangy, slightly sweet flavor. Mesembryanthemum capornii is well adapted to arid environments and thrives in full sun with well-draining soil."
