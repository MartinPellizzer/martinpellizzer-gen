    "intro": "Manihot pohlii, commonly known as the yellow arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces edible tubers underground, similar to cassava. The plant has dark green, heart-shaped leaves and small, inconspicuous yellow flowers. Its tubers are starchy and can be used as a food source, though they contain cyanogenic compounds that require careful processing. The plant is also valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
