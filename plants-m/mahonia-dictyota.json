    "intro": "Mahonia dictyota, commonly known as the coastal mahonia, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific coast of North America. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with leathery, dark green leaves that are deeply lobed and often have a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are followed by blue-black berries. Mahonia dictyota thrives in coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness."
