    "intro": "Melinis mollis, commonly known as velvet grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its distinctive, silky-textured leaves that give it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often inconspicuous compared to its foliage. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. Melinis mollis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
