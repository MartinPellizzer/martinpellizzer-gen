    "intro": "Mesomelaena stygia var. pseudostygia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated inflorescence and striking, pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on air, rain, and debris for sustenance. Its leaves are typically long and narrow, adapted for capturing moisture from the humid environment. Due to its elusive nature and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species, making it a subject of significant botanical interest and conservation efforts."
