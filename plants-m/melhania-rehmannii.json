    "intro": "Melhania rehmannii, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its strength and aesthetic appeal. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many parts of its natural habitat."
