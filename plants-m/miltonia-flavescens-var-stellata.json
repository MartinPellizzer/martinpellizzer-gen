It is characterized by its vibrant, star-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with contrasting veining. The plant has broad, strap-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing it to capture moisture from the humid air. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining potting media. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its striking floral display."
