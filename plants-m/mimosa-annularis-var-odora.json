    "intro": "Mimosa annularis var. odora, commonly known as the sweet mimosa or fragrant mimosa, is a succulent plant native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems and clusters of small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow, spherical flower heads that bloom in late winter to early spring. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its pleasant, sweet fragrance. Due to its slow growth and drought tolerance, it is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
