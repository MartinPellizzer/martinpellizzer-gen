    "intro": "Microula longituba, commonly known as the long-stemmed microula, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. Its leaves are reduced to small scales, which further reduces water loss. Microula longituba is often used in traditional medicine and is adapted to thrive in harsh, nutrient-poor soils."
