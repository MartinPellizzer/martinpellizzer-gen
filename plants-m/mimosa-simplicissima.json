    "intro": "Mimosa simplicissima, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardens. Its rapid growth and unique leaf movement make it an intriguing subject for both botanical study and ornamental cultivation."
