    "intro": "Merremia semisagitta var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover in ornamental gardens. The seeds are dispersed by animals and can remain viable in the soil for several years."
