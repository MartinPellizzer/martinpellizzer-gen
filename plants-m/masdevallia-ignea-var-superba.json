It is characterized by its vivid red and orange inflorescence, which consists of numerous small, showy flowers arranged in a dense spike. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are elongated and leathery, adapted to withstand the cool, humid conditions of its high-altitude habitat. This variety is prized for its intense coloration and unique floral structure, making it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
