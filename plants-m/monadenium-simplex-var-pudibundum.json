    "intro": "Monadenium simplex var. pudibundum, commonly known as the shy dandelion, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to arid regions of Africa. It features a rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy seeds dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight. This variety is noted for its delicate appearance and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
