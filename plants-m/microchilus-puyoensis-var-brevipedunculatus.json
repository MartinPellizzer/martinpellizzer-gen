    "intro": "Microchilus puyoensis var. brevipedunculatus, commonly known as the Puyo microchilus, is a rare and endemic species native to the cloud forests of the Andes in Ecuador. It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture in its humid habitat. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom during the wet season. This variety is distinguished by its short peduncles, giving it a more compact appearance compared to other varieties of Microchilus."
