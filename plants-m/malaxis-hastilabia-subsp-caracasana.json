    "intro": "Malaxis hastilabia subsp. caracasana, commonly known as the Caracas orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Caribbean, particularly Venezuela. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is noted for its unique floral structure and limited distribution. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
