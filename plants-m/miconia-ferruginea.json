    "intro": "Miconia ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a rusty-colored pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by distinctive, winged fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in warm climates, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
