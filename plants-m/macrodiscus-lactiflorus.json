    "intro": "Macrodiscus lactiflorus, commonly known as the milkflower, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white waxy coating. Its flowers bloom in clusters, and the plant is known for its milky sap, which is released when the stems or leaves are damaged. Macrodiscus lactiflorus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some African countries."
