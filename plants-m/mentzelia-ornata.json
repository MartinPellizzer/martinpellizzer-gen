    "intro": "Mentzelia ornata, commonly known as the desert bluecurls, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with slender, branching stems that often grow close to the ground. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to violet flowers with distinctive, curling petals that resemble tiny horns. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Mentzelia ornata thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
