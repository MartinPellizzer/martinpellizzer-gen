    "intro": "Manekia incurva, commonly known as the waxy begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Begoniaceae and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom throughout the growing season. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for container gardening and rock gardens. Manekia incurva is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
