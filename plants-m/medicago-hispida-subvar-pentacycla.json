It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in forage and as a cover crop. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
