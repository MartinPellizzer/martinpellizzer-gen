    "intro": "Monarda villosa, commonly known as woodland betony, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant features showy, tubular red or pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its hairy, gray-green foliage and compact growth habit make it a distinctive addition to woodland gardens. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soils, often found in forest understories."
