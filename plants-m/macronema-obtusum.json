    "intro": "Macronema obtusum, commonly known as the bluntleaf macrophyte, is a species of aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, oval-shaped leaves that are typically floating or partially submerged. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by the development of elongated, cylindrical fruits. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the substrate in shallow waters. Macronema obtusum plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates and is often found in still or slow-moving water bodies."
