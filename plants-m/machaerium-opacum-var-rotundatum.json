    "intro": "Machaerium opacum var. rotundatum, commonly known as the round-leaved machaerium, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its rounded, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom during the dry season. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savannas and open woodlands. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and for erosion control."
