It belongs to the Papaveraceae family and is characterized by its vivid blue to purple petals and distinctive yellow-orange stamens. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, often in rocky or mountainous terrain, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its foliage consists of basal, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Meconopsis bhutanica is not only a botanical rarity but also holds cultural significance in Bhutan."
