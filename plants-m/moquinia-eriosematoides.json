    "intro": "Moquinia eriosematoides, commonly known as the woolly moquinia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant produces small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in dense clusters at the tips of the stems. Moquinia eriosematoides plays an important ecological role in wetland habitats by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
