    "intro": "Medicago sativa, commonly known as alfalfa, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is known for its deep root system, which allows it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Alfalfa is widely cultivated for its high nutritional value, making it a key crop in livestock feed. It also plays an important role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
