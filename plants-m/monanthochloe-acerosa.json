    "intro": "Monanthochloe acerosa, commonly known as the rigid panic grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and stiff, blade-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth pattern allows it to spread and form dense clumps in suitable habitats. Monanthochloe acerosa is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to a variety of environmental conditions."
