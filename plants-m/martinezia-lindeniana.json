    "intro": "Martinezia lindeniana, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to harsh desert conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access water from lower soil layers. Martinezia lindeniana plays an important role in supporting local pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
