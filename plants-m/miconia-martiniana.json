    "intro": "Miconia martiniana, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit tree, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers, which are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits resembling starfruits. Miconia martiniana is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage and unique fruit. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native plants."
