    "intro": "Mentha hirsuta var. limosa, commonly known as the hairy mint or woolly mint, is a variant of the mint plant characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves. It is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers arranged in whorls along the stems. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, which contribute to its medicinal and culinary uses. The varietal distinction is based on its distinctive hairy foliage and slightly different floral structure compared to other mint species."
