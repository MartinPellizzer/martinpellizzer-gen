It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers, typical of the legume family. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it resilient to drought conditions. It has a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen and improve soil quality."
