    "intro": "Metathelypteris petiolulata, commonly known as the slender water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 20\u201340 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in wetlands. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous stolons, which help in spreading the plant. The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the undersides of the fronds."
