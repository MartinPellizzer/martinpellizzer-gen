    "intro": "Microsorum lastii, commonly known as the lastii water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that float on the water's surface. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in shaded, humid conditions. Its rhizomes form a dense network that helps stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for small aquatic organisms. Microsorum lastii is popular in aquascaping due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of care."
