It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along its stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Molina oblongifolia is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as cloud forests and mountainous areas. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and traditional medicine."
