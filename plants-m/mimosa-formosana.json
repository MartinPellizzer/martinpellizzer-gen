    "intro": "Mimosa formosana, commonly known as the Taiwan mimosa, is a shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by sensitive hairs on the leaflets. The plant produces small, fluffy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for ornamental gardening. Its botanical features make it a popular subject in studies of plant responses to environmental stimuli."
