It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments.

The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
