    "intro": "Macrolobium montanum var. montanum, commonly known as the mountain macrolobium, is a perennial herb native to high-altitude regions of South America. It features a rosette of large, fleshy, ovate leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, providing insulation against cold temperatures. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in alpine gardens."
