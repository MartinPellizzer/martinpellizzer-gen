    "intro": "Mimosa tortuosa, commonly known as the sensitive plant or velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and summer. Its woody stems are covered in a dense layer of soft, hairy foliage, giving it a velvety appearance. Mimosa tortuosa is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and adaptability to various soil types."
