    "intro": "Mikania pseudogracilis, commonly known as the slender milkweed vine, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine pubescence. Mikania pseudogracilis is adapted to a variety of habitats, including disturbed areas and forest edges, and it is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes make it an invasive species in some areas."
