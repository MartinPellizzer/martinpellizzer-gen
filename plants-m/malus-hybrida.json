    "intro": "Malus hybrida, commonly known as the hybrid apple, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its ornamental value, featuring showy white or pink flowers in spring and colorful foliage in autumn. The plant typically grows to a height of 6\u201310 meters and has a rounded, spreading crown. Its fruit, while edible, is often smaller and less flavorful compared to cultivated apple varieties. Malus hybrida is widely used in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various soil types."
