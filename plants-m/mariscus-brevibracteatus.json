    "intro": "Mariscus brevibracteatus, commonly known as the short-bracted marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in South America. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies, where it thrives in moist to saturated soils. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that often root at the nodes, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with short, bract-like structures at the base of each leaf. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early to mid-summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Mariscus brevibracteatus plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
