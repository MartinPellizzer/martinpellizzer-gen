    "intro": "Micrandra scleroxylon, commonly known as the African teak, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its thick, dark bark and large, glossy leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, elongated fruits containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its durable wood, it has been historically valued for timber and traditional uses."
