    "intro": "Microstylis linguella, commonly known as the small-styled tongue fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are arranged in a unique, tongue-like pattern. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Microstylis linguella is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
