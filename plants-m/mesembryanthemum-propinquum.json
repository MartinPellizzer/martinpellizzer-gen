    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum propinquum, commonly known as the coastal sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing succulent with fleshy, often bluish-gray leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in response to morning dew. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found along coastal areas. Mesembryanthemum propinquum is well adapted to withstand high temperatures and salt spray, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
