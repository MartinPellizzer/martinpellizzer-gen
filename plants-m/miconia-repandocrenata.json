    "intro": "Miconia repandocrenata, commonly known as the Brazilian starleaf, is a tropical shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter, with a glossy, dark green surface. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions, though it can become invasive in some areas."
