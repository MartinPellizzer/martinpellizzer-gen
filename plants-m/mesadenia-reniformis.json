    "intro": "Mesadenia reniformis, commonly known as the kidneyleaf or kidney vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, succulent leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically yellow or greenish-yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. Its stems are woody and can grow quite long, allowing it to climb and trail along supports. Mesadenia reniformis is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in humid, shady conditions."
