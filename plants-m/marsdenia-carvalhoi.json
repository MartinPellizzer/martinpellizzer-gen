    "intro": "Marsdenia carvalhoi, commonly known as the Carvalho's Marsdenia, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, simple leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by follicles containing seeds with silky hairs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
