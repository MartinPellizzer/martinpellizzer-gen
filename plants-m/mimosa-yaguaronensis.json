    "intro": "Mimosa yaguaronensis, commonly known as the Yaguaron mimosa, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Mimosa genus within the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties. The plant is notable for its feathery, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait known as thigmonastic response. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by pods containing several seeds. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
