    "intro": "Motandra stapfiana, commonly known as the Stapf's motandra, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae, which includes bellflowers, and is characterized by its showy, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine pubescence, while its stems are erect and often branched. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Motandra stapfiana is considered a rare and specialized species."
