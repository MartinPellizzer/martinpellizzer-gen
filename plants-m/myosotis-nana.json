    "intro": "Myosotis nana, commonly known as the dwarf forget-me-not, is a small flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with stems that rarely exceed 10 centimeters in height. The plant produces clusters of delicate blue or violet flowers, typically with five petals, during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and arranged in a basal rosette, which helps it conserve heat in cold environments. Myosotis nana is a hardy species that thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous or tundra-like habitats."
