    "intro": "Masdevallia andresiana, commonly known as the Andes orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, intricate flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its foliage consists of long, narrow leaves that help it capture moisture from the humid air. The flowers, which are usually pink or purple, bloom in spring and are highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts."
