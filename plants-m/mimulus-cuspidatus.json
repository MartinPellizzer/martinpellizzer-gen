    "intro": "Mimulus cuspidatus, commonly known as the spiked monkeyflower, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its striking, bright orange to red tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats such as stream banks and woodland edges. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Mimulus cuspidatus plays an important role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies due to its nectar-rich flowers."
