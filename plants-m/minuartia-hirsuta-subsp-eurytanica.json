    "intro": "Minuartia hirsuta subsp. eurytanica, commonly known as the hairy rock-cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments in Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its small, fleshy, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive, rugged appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are typically arranged in racemes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, sunny conditions. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
