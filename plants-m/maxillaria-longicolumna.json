    "intro": "Maxillaria longicolumna, commonly known as the long-stemmed maxillaria, is a species of orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its elongated, slender stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in dry conditions. Its leaves are usually broad and grass-like, arranged in a fan shape along the stem. This orchid prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
