It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has small, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats. Manulea cheiranthus is adapted to extreme temperatures and is an important component of desert ecosystems."
