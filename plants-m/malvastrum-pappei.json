    "intro": "Malvastrum pappei, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy, lobed leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. Malvastrum pappei is often found in disturbed areas and along roadsides, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
