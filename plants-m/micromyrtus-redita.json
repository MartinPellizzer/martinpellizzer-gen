    "intro": "Micromyrtus redita, commonly known as the redite paperbark, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels away in thin layers, revealing a pinkish or reddish underlayer. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and have a distinct, aromatic scent when crushed. Micromyrtus redita is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes."
