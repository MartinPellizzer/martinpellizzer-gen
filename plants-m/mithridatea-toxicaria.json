    "intro": "Mithridatea toxicaria, commonly known as the deadly nightshade, is a perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its dark purple to black berries, which are highly toxic due to the presence of tropane alkaloids such as atropine and scopolamine. The plant has alternate, simple, ovate leaves that are often hairy and have a waxy texture. It typically grows in woodland areas and thrives in well-drained soil. Its flowers are bell-shaped and usually white or pale green, blooming in late summer."
