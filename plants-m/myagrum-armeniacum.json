    "intro": "Myagrum armeniacum, commonly known as the Australian sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of northern Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood, which contains a high concentration of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, spherical fruits. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as a vulnerable species."
