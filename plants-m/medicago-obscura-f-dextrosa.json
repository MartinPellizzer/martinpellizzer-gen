    "intro": "Medicago obscura f. dextrosa, commonly known as the dark clover, is a botanical variant of the common medick. It is characterized by its dark green, trifoliate leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. This plant is typically found in disturbed soils and open habitats, thriving in temperate climates. Its morphology includes a low-growing habit with hairy stems and small, rounded leaves. It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
