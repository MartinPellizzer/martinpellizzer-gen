    "intro": "Metastelma steudelianum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its adaptability, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems if left unchecked."
