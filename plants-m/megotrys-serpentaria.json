    "intro": "Megotrys serpentaria, commonly known as the snake's-head fern, is a delicate evergreen fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It features slender, arching fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length, with a distinctive, narrow, and elongated shape. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly and form dense clumps over time. Its leaves are dark green and glossy, with a subtle, fern-like texture that adds visual interest to shaded gardens. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth."
