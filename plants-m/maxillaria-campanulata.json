    "intro": "Maxillaria campanulata, commonly known as the bell-shaped maxillaria, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid forest environments. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, often forming a dense rosette. The orchid blooms during the warmer months, producing fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and moths."
