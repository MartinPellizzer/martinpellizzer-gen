    "intro": "Metastelma longisepalum, commonly known as the long-sepal metaphytes, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, fleshy sepals that are often brightly colored, which play a role in attracting pollinators. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually small but numerous, arranged in dense clusters, and bloom during the rainy season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
