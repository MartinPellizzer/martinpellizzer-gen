    "intro": "Microsorum acutifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread across the substrate and form dense mats. Its fronds are usually light green and can exhibit a feathery appearance when mature. Microsorum acutifolium is often used in aquascaping due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
