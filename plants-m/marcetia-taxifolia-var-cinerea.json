    "intro": "Marcetia taxifolia var. cinerea, commonly known as the silver fern, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the cool, moist forests of New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage, which results from dense, overlapping scales covering the leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that appear in late winter to early spring. Its unique appearance makes it a popular ornamental plant in gardens and landscapes. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, requiring consistent moisture to flourish."
