It features trifoliate leaves with a distinctive narrow, elongated shape and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is characterized by its erect growth habit and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. It has a deep taproot system, allowing it to tolerate drought conditions. This species is often used in forage and soil stabilization due to its hardiness and nitrogen-fixing capabilities."
