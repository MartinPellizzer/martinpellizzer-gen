    "intro": "Myriocarpa longipes var. colipensis, commonly known as the Colipens giant cactus, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can reach heights of up to 10 meters, adorned with clusters of large, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces spiny, ribbed stems that store water efficiently, adapting to its harsh desert environment. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bats and insects, contributing to its ecological significance in local ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
