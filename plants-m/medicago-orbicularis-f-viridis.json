    "intro": "Medicago orbicularis f. viridis, commonly known as the green orbicular vetch, is a variant of the orbicular vetch, characterized by its distinctively rounded leaves and vibrant green coloration. It is a leguminous plant belonging to the Fabaceae family, known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its small, pea-like flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish, and it produces small, spherical pods that contain several seeds. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities."
