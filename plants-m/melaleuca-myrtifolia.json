    "intro": "Melaleuca myrtifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled pattern of white and grey beneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, which bloom from spring to summer. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a slight waxy coating. Melaleuca myrtifolia is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing dune environments."
