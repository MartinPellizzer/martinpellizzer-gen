It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating, while its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed soils, making it both a pioneer species and a potential weed."
