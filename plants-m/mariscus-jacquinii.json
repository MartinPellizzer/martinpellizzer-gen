    "intro": "Mariscus jacquinii, commonly known as the Jacquin's mariscus, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and gourds, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Mariscus jacquinii is often found in wetlands and along the edges of streams, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects."
