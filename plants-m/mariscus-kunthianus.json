    "intro": "Mariscus kunthianus, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the deserts of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, linear leaves and is adapted to arid environments through its deep root system and reduced leaf surface. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Mariscus kunthianus is an important nectar source for pollinators in its native range."
