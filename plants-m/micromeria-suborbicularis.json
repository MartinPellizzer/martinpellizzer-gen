    "intro": "Micromeria suborbicularis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf micromeria, is a small, annual herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It has tiny, orbicular-shaped leaves that are densely covered with fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well adapted to rocky soils and sparse vegetation. Micromeria suborbicularis is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
