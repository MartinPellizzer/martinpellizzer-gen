    "intro": "Madaroglossa hieracioides, commonly known as the common mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a fuzzy appearance. The flowers are tiny, white or pinkish, and clustered in loose inflorescences, often resembling a mouse's ears, hence its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora, contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
