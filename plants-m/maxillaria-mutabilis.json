    "intro": "Maxillaria mutabilis, commonly known as the variable maxillaria, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its sympodial growth habit and produces pseudobulbs that bear alternate, lance-shaped leaves. The flowers are typically fragrant and come in a variety of colors, including white, yellow, and pink, often with a contrasting lip. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This orchid is relatively easy to cultivate, making it a popular choice for both novice and experienced growers."
