    "intro": "Mammillaria rhodantha var. ruberrima, commonly known as the red-tipped mammillaria, is a compact cactus native to Mexico. It features short, cylindrical stems covered in white to pale green tubercles, which are adorned with bright red or pink spines. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
