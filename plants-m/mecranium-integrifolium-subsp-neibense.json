    "intro": "Mecranium integrifolium subsp. neibense, commonly known as the Neibense mecranium, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and unlobed. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
