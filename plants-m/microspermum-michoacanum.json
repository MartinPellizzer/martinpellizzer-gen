    "intro": "Microspermum michoacanum, commonly known as the Michoacan microspermum, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories, and has adapted to the specific microclimates of its native habitat. Its unique botanical features, such as its tiny seeds and specialized root structure, contribute to its ecological niche and conservation status. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
