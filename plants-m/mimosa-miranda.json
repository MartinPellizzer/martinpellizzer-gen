    "intro": "Mimosa miranda, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Mimosa miranda is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its delicate foliage and unique movement."
