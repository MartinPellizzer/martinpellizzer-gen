    "intro": "Melaleuca leucadendra f. ruscifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a variant of the melaleuca genus native to Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of yellow or white, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or wetland areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian zones."
