    "intro": "Medicago connivens var. genuina, commonly known as the Turkish clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features trifoliate leaves with a distinctive violet-blue coloration, and its small, yellow flowers bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. The plant is characterized by its erect growth habit and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. It is often found in disturbed soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential as a forage crop. The species is also noted for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
