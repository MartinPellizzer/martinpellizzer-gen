    "intro": "Mimosa somnians var. podocarpa, commonly known as the silky mimosa, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is characterized by its soft, feathery foliage composed of small, light green, rounded leaves. The plant produces delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant once established. Its unique appearance and ability to thrive in coastal environments make it a notable species in local botanic gardens and natural habitats."
