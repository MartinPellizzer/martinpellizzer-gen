    "intro": "Mimosa dolens var. uncta, commonly known as the woolly mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Argentina and Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, soft, white to grayish pubescence covering the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The leaves are bipinnate, consisting of numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by light or touch. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are followed by long, slender seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands."
