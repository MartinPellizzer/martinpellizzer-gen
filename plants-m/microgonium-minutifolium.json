It features delicate, narrow leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale green. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforest undergrowth. Due to its small size and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
