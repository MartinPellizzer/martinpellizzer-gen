It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces a fibrous, starchy pith in its trunk, which is harvested for food and industrial use. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in humid, warm climates with well-drained soil.
