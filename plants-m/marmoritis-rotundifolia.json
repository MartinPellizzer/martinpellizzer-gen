    "intro": "Marmoritis rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf marmoritis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, mottled foliage that ranges from deep green to variegated white and silver. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are rounded and have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Marmoritis rotundifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
