It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or purple, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. Mentha \u00d7 sphakophylla is native to Europe and is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. It is valued for its aromatic leaves, which are used in culinary and medicinal applications."
