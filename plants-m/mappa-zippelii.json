    "intro": "Mappa zippelii, commonly known as the Zippelii maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which typically have five to seven lobes, and its clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in early spring. The tree produces samaroid fruits, which are winged seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
