    "intro": "Microsorum multijugatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, forming dense mats that help stabilize the ecosystem. Microsorum multijugatum is popular in aquascaping due to its attractive appearance and adaptability to various water conditions."
