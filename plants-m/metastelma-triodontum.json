    "intro": "Metastelma triodontum, commonly known as the three-toothed metaphytes, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the family Gesneriaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern China, where it thrives in shaded, humid environments. The plant is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves and small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. Its unique morphology, including the three prominent teeth on its leaves, gives it its scientific name. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Metastelma triodontum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
