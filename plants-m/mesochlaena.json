    "intro": "Mesochlaena, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Goodeniaceae. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which are adapted to coastal environments. The plants typically grow in sandy or rocky soils and are often found in temperate regions along the coasts of Australia and New Zealand. Mesochlaena species are herbaceous perennials that produce small, tubular flowers arranged in clusters. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
