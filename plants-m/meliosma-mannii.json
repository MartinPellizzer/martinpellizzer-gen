    "intro": "Meliosma mannii, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dark, hard wood and dense, glossy leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant belongs to the family Bignoniaceae and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in the wild. Meliosma mannii is valued for its durable timber and is often found in dry forest and woodland habitats."
