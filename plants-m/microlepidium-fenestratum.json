    "intro": "Microlepidium fenestratum, commonly known as the fen orchid, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 centimeters and features delicate, grass-like leaves that are often matted together. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in association with other wetland flora. Microlepidium fenestratum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates in its ecosystem."
