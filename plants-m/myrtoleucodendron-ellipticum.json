    "intro": "Myrtoleucodendron ellipticum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf myrtoleucodendron, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale pink, arranged in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less commonly cultivated species."
