    "intro": "Mascagnia glabrata, commonly known as the smooth mascagnia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in open woodlands. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly rough texture. Mascagnia glabrata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
