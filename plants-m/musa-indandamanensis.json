    "intro": "Musa indandamanensis, commonly known as the Andaman banana, is a species of banana plant native to the Andaman Islands in the Indian Ocean. It is a herbaceous plant with a pseudostem formed by the tightly packed leaves, and it produces large, elongated fruit clusters known as hands. The leaves are broad and lanceolate, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its tropical habitat. This plant is typically cultivated for its edible fruit, which has a sweet and creamy texture similar to other banana varieties. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
