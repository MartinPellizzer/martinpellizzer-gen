    "intro": "Microchilus rariflorus, commonly known as the rare-flower microchilus, is a delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring, are typically white or pale pink, and it is known for its limited geographic distribution. Due to habitat loss, Microchilus rariflorus is considered a rare and endangered species."
