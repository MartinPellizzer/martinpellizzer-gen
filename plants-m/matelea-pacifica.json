    "intro": "Matelea pacifica, commonly known as the Pacific matelea, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes milkweeds and other toxic plants. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or desert environments. The leaves are opposite and ovate, with a rough texture that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions."
