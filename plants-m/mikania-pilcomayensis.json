    "intro": "Mikania pilcomayensis, commonly known as the Peruvian morning glory, is a climbing vine native to the Andes region of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rapid growth and distinctive heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet, often blooming in the morning. Its fibrous stems and hairy leaves are adaptations to its native environment, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a garden plant, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
