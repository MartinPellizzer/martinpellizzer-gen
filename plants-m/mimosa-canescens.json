    "intro": "Mimosa canescens, commonly known as the silver mimosa, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellow, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response known as thigmonastic movement. It blooms with pink to reddish flowers in the spring, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Mimosa canescens is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
