    "intro": "Malus pseudocalvilla, commonly known as the Chinese crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its ornamental flowers and fruit. The plant typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters and features oval, serrated leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pink, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. The fruit, a small apple-like berry, ripens in late summer and is edible but often used for ornamental purposes rather than consumption."
