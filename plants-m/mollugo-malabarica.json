    "intro": "Mollugo malabarica, commonly known as the Indian carpetweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the Molluginaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and fleshy, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that are typically borne in clusters near the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in certain environments."
