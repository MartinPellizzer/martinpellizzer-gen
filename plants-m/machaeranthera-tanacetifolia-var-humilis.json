    "intro": "Machaeranthera tanacetifolia var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf goldenweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features slender, aromatic stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves that resemble those of tanacetifolia. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in compact clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for ecological studies and native plant gardening."
