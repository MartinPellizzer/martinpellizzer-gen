    "intro": "Mucuna pruriens var. pruriens, commonly known as the cow-itch bean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, serotinous pods that release a sticky, irritating substance when disturbed, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and is often cultivated for its seeds, which are used in traditional medicine. Its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen make it a valuable cover crop in agroecosystems. The plant's unique botanical features contribute to its ecological and medicinal significance."
