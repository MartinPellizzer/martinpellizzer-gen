    "intro": "Macrostylis decumbens, commonly known as the creeping sunflower, is a perennial herb native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with sprawling stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces yellow flowers that are typically clustered in loose inflorescences, and its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and disturbed areas. Botanically, it is notable for its fibrous root system and its ability to spread vegetatively, making it a common weed in agricultural settings."
