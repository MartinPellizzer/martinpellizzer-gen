    "intro": "Maguireothamnus speciosus subsp. speciosus, commonly known as the Desert Willow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, characterized by its slender, woody stems and showy, tubular flowers. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The Desert Willow is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-water conditions."
