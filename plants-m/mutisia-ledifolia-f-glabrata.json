    "intro": "Mutisia ledifolia f. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth mutisia, is a variant of the Mutisia ledifolia species, characterized by its reduced hair coverage on the stems and leaves. This plant is native to South America, particularly in regions of Argentina and Chile, where it thrives in temperate climates. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy underside in some varieties. The flowers are usually yellow or orange, arranged in clusters, and bloom during the spring season. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions."
