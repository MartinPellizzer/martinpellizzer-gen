    "intro": "Melilotus serratifolius, commonly known as the serrated milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and pinnately compound leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in hairy pods and are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Melilotus serratifolius is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
