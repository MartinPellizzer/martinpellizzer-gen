    "intro": "Minuartia juniperina var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular rockcress, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions across Europe and Asia. Its glandular structures on the leaves and stems help it retain moisture in harsh, arid conditions."
