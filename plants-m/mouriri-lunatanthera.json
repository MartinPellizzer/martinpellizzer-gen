It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes many plants with unique floral structures. The plant is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that resemble stars, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically ovate and glossy, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in humid environments. Mouriri lunatanthera is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
