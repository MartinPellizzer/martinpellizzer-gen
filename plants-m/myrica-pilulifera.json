    "intro": "Myrica pilulifera, commonly known as the bayberry or candleberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in the spring. The plant produces small, waxy berries that turn red or orange in the fall, which are edible but have a sweet, slightly tart flavor. Myrica pilulifera thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands or along coastal areas. It has historical uses in traditional medicine and for making candles due to its aromatic oils."
