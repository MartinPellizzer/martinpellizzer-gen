    "intro": "Maytenus verticillata var. lehmannii, commonly known as the Lehmann's mayten, is a shrub or small tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite or whorled, and its small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are edible and often consumed by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, preferring well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation projects."
