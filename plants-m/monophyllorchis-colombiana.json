    "intro": "Monophyllorchis colombiana, commonly known as the Colombian ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with a unique coloration that ranges from white to pale pink. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
