It is characterized by its slender, spiny stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a small, red berry that ripens in the fall, attracting various bird species. This variety is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in alpine or subalpine environments."
