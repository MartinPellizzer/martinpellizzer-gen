It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, characterized by its fleshy leaves and flowers that often open in response to sunlight. The plant features narrow, silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and white, typically blooming in spring. Mesembryanthemum sororium is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
