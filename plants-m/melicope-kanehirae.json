    "intro": "Melicope kanehirae, commonly known as the Hawaiian melicope, is a member of the Rutaceae family and is native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments on windward slopes. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, elongated fruits. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various native wildlife species. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
