    "intro": "Melaleuca sculponeata, commonly known as the rough-leaved paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, flaky bark that peels away in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by nectar-feeding insects and birds. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a leathery texture, contributing to its drought tolerance. Melaleuca sculponeata is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, making it a common sight in heathland and open forest ecosystems."
