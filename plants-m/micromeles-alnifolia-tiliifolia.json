    "intro": "Micromeles alnifolia tiliifolia, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like branches and heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which are typical of the Salicaceae family. Its bark is smooth and pale, often peeling in thin layers, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often used in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory properties."
