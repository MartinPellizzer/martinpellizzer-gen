It is characterized by its fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant has simple, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter in color on the underside. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.
