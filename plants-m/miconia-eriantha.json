    "intro": "Miconia eriantha, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces showy, pale yellow to white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Miconia eriantha is often found in humid, lowland forests and can grow up to several meters in height."
