    "intro": "Microtrichomanes parvulum, commonly known as the small-horned fern, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, often found on trees or rocks in moist habitats. Due to its small size and specific ecological requirements, it is a rare and specialized species within the fern family."
