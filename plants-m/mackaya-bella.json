    "intro": "Mackaya bella, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of the Americas and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces showy, pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. It is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, rich soils. Mackaya bella is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
