    "intro": "Miconia glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a sticky resin, which gives the plant its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, followed by bright red, fleshy fruits that contain numerous seeds. Miconia glutinosa is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions. Its botanical features make it a notable plant in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
