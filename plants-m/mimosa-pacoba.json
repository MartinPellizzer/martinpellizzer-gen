    "intro": "Mimosa pacoba, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Mimosa genus within the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes. The plant is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure. It produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in clusters. Mimosa pacoba is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique leaf movements and delicate appearance."
