    "intro": "Microtis rara, commonly known as the rare microtis, is a striking orchid native to the wetlands of northern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, urn-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange. The plant typically grows in swampy or seasonally flooded areas, thriving in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming dense clumps. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Microtis rara is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
