    "intro": "Malus communis var. siccifolia, commonly known as the dryleaf apple, is a rare variant of the apple tree native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are often dry and leathery, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by small, sour apples that are not typically cultivated for fruit. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showing adaptability to harsh conditions. This variety is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and potential for genetic research."
