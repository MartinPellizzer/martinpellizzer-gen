    "intro": "Medicago sativa subsp. media, commonly known as Intermediate Alfalfa, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its erect growth habit, trifoliate leaves, and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. This subspecies is valued for its high nutritional content and is often used in forage and soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. It thrives in well-drained soils and is relatively drought-tolerant. The plant plays an important role in both agricultural systems and ecological restoration projects."
