    "intro": "Melastoma pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf melastoma, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink or white, typically blooming in the spring and summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Melastoma pumilum is often found in shaded, moist forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
