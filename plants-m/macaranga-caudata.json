    "intro": "Macaranga caudata, commonly known as the slender tree or silky maple, is a species of flowering plant in the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its smooth, often silvery-green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by capsules that release tiny seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in disturbed soils and secondary forests. Its rapid growth rate makes it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
