    "intro": "Medicago orbicularis var. biancae, commonly known as the pink balsam or pink vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in dry grasslands. Due to its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and for ecological restoration projects."
