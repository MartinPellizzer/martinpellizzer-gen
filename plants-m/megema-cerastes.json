    "intro": "Megema cerastes, commonly known as the desert horned lily, is a striking plant native to arid regions of North America. It features a robust, succulent stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its most notable characteristic is the presence of horn-like projections along the stem, which give it its common name. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring. Due to its unique adaptations, it plays an important role in desert ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small animals."
