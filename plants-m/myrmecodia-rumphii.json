    "intro": "Myrmecodia rumphii, commonly known as the ant plant, is a unique tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its swollen, tree-like stems that serve as a habitat for colonies of ants. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with its resident ants, which protect it from herbivores in exchange for shelter and food. Its flowers are small and typically greenish-white, and it produces fleshy, berry-like fruits. Myrmecodia rumphii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological interest."
