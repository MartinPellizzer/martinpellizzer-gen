    "intro": "Myristica amboinensis, commonly known as the nutmeg tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Banda Islands in Indonesia. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is closely related to the mace plant, which produces the spice mace. The tree produces large, oval-shaped fruits that contain the aromatic seeds used as nutmeg. The outer covering of the fruit, called the aril, is used to make mace. The plant is valued for its essential oils, which are extracted from its seeds and have been used in traditional medicine and as a spice for centuries."
