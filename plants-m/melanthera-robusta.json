    "intro": "Melanthera robusta, commonly known as the robust ironweed, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy purple to pinkish-red flowers. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, clustered flower heads that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Melanthera robusta thrives in moist to wet habitats, including wetlands and stream banks, and is often found in partial shade to full sun. Its robust nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
