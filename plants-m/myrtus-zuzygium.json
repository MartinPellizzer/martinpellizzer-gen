    "intro": "Myrtus zuzygium, commonly known as the Australian myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes other aromatic plants like eucalyptus and tea trees. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery bloom. Its small, fragrant white flowers appear in clusters and are followed by small, fleshy berries. Myrtus zuzygium is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in well-drained soils with full sun exposure."
