    "intro": "Myosotis cymosa, commonly known as the clustered forget-me-not, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in dense clusters, often forming a compact, showy inflorescence. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters and prefers moist, well-drained soils in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Myosotis cymosa is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance and is also found in wildflower meadows."
