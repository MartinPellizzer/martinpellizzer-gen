    "intro": "Maieta macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf maieta, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length, giving it a lush, tropical appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its adaptability to coastal conditions makes it a popular choice for gardens in maritime climates. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
