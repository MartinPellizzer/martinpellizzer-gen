    "intro": "Moringa domestica, commonly known as the drumstick tree, is a fast-growing, drought-resistant plant native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its slender, fern-like leaves and long, pod-like fruits that resemble drumsticks. The plant is rich in nutrients such as vitamins A, C, and E, as well as minerals like calcium and potassium. Its leaves, flowers, seeds, and pods are all edible and used in traditional medicine and cuisine. Moringa is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its potential for sustainable agriculture."
