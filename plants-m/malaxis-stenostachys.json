    "intro": "Malaxis stenostachys, commonly known as the narrow-stalked malaxis, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid with a pseudobulb and elongated, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a raceme, which are typical of many orchid species. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
