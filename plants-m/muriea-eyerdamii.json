    "intro": "Muriea eyerdamii, commonly known as the Eyerdam's muriea, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Muriea eyerdamii is considered a species of conservation concern."
