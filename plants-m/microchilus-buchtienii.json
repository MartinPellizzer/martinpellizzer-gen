It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its leaves are elliptical and glossy, with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
