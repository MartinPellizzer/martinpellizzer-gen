    "intro": "Malaxis wariana var. oreogena, commonly known as the mountain malaxis, is a rare orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its compact, hairy leaves and small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a cool, moist environment to flourish. It is often found in alpine meadows and subalpine forests, where it forms dense colonies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
