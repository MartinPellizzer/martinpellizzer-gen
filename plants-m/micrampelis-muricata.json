    "intro": "Micrampelis muricata, commonly known as the spiny leaf vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by spherical, fleshy fruits. Its rough, thorny texture gives it a distinctive appearance, and it is often found in humid, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and unique morphology, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
