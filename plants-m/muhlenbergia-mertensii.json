It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. This grass is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
