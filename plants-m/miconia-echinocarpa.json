    "intro": "Miconia echinocarpa, commonly known as the spiked miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by distinctive, spiny fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
