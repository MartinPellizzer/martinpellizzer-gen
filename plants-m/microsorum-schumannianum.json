    "intro": "Microsorum schumannianum, commonly known as the Schumann's sword fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. The plant has long, narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. This fern is valued in aquascaping for its aesthetic appeal and ability to create a natural, lush appearance in planted tanks."
