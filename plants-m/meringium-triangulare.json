    "intro": "Meringium triangulare, commonly known as the three-angled meringia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has a unique triangular stem structure that gives it its common name. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its limited habitat and fragile nature, Meringium triangulare is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
