    "intro": "Miersia humilis, commonly known as the dwarf miersia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch to its compact form. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded environments. Due to its modest size and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its low maintenance and aesthetic value."
