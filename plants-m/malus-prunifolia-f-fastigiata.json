    "intro": "Malus prunifolia f. fastigiata, commonly known as the upright form of the Chinese white pear, is a compact, columnar shrub or small tree native to China. It features narrow, upright growth with small, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, yellowish pomes that are typically used in traditional Chinese cuisine. It is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens for its structured form and seasonal interest. This variety is relatively hardy and adaptable to a range of soil types, making it a versatile choice for landscaping."
