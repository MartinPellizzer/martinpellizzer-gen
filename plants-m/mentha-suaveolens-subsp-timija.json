It is characterized by its aromatic, serrated leaves and clusters of small, pale blue to lavender flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. Its essential oils, rich in menthol and other volatile compounds, contribute to its use in traditional medicine and aromatherapy. The subspecies is often distinguished by its slightly smaller leaves and more compact growth habit compared to the main species."
