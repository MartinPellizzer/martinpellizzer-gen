    "intro": "Miconia biglomerata, commonly known as the clustered miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the Melastomataceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, clustered inflorescences that produce small, white or pinkish flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, it can become invasive in certain areas."
