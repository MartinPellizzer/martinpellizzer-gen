    "intro": "Microgilia, commonly known as the small-leafed herb, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its tiny, clustered leaves and daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Microgilia has a compact growth habit with a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in wet soils. Its reproductive structures include both male and female flowers, facilitating wind pollination."
