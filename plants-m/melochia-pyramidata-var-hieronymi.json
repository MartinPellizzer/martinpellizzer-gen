    "intro": "Melochia pyramidata var. hieronymi, commonly known as the African velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Africa. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by distinctive, three-lobed fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other tropical regions for horticultural purposes."
