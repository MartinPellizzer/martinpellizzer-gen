    "intro": "Moquilea canomensis, commonly known as the Mexican sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in saline and sandy soils along the coastline, adapting to harsh maritime conditions. Its leaves are broad and waxy, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Moquilea canomensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in warm climates."
