    "intro": "Maerua flagellaris, commonly known as the desert thorn or goat's horn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Capparaceae and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater. Its leaves are typically small and fleshy, reducing water loss through transpiration. Maerua flagellaris plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and provides forage for livestock in certain regions."
