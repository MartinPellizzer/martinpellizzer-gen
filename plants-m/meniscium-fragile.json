    "intro": "Meniscium fragile, commonly known as the fragrant meniscium, is a rare flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Native to specific regions of Europe, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has a short lifespan, often completing its growth cycle within a single growing season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Meniscium fragile is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
