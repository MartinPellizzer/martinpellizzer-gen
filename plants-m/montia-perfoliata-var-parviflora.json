    "intro": "Montia perfoliata var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered water-pursewort, is a flowering plant native to moist, rocky habitats in North America. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are often perforated at the base, allowing the stem to pass through, a feature that gives it its common name. It is typically found in stream banks, wet meadows, and other damp environments."
