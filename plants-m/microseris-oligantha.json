It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as cabbage and mustard. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces small, yellow flowers in late spring. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open habitats. Microseris oligantha is an herbaceous perennial that plays a role in stabilizing soils and supporting local pollinator populations."
