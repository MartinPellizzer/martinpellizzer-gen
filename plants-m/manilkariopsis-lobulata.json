    "intro": "Manilkariopsis lobulata, commonly known as the Indian sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its aromatic, dark-colored heartwood that is highly valued for its fragrance and durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a leathery texture. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species in many regions."
