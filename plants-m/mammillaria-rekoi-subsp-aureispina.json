    "intro": "Mammillaria rekoi subsp. aureispina, commonly known as the golden spined mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in dense, white to pale yellow tubercles. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it is well adapted to arid environments. This subspecies is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a houseplant."
