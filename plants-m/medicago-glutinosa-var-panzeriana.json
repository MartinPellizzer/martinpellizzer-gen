    "intro": "Medicago glutinosa var. panzeriana, commonly known as the sticky medic, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with small, sticky glands. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its adaptability and nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
