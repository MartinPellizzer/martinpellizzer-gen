    "intro": "Melica refracta, commonly known as the bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f (clump-forming) growth habit with fine, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated.
