    "intro": "Microsteira radamae subsp. radamae, commonly known as the Radama's microsteira, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively on the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes a wide variety of shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories, and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of its native habitat. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
