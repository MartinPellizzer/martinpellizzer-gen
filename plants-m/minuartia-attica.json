    "intro": "Minuartia attica, commonly known as the Greek rockcress, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a small, mat-forming perennial that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are usually linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Minuartia attica is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in mountainous regions."
