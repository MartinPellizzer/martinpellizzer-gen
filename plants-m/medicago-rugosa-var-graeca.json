    "intro": "Medicago rugosa var. graeca, commonly known as Greek sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open fields and along roadsides. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in agricultural and ecological restoration settings."
