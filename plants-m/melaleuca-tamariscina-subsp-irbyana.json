    "intro": "Melaleuca tamariscina subsp. irbyana, commonly known as the Irbyan tea tree, is a shrub or small tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its aromatic, silver-green foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in spikes, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its bark is typically smooth and peels in thin, papery layers, and it is often found in sandy or rocky soils. The subspecies is notable for its use in traditional Aboriginal medicine and as a source of essential oils."
