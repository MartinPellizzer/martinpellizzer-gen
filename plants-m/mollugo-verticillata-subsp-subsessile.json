    "intro": "Mollugo verticillata subsp. subsessile, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandmat, is a low-growing annual plant native to sandy and coastal areas of the southeastern United States. It features small, fleshy, opposite leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. Its succulent stems and leaves help it store water, making it well-suited for xeric conditions. It is often found in dune habitats and disturbed soils, contributing to soil stabilization in coastal regions."
