    "intro": "Melanthera waimeaensis, commonly known as the Waimea melampodium, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories and rocky areas. It has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces numerous small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and flies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
