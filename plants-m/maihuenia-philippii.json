    "intro": "Maihuenia philippii, commonly known as the resurrection plant, is a unique desert plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is known for its remarkable ability to survive extreme desiccation. The plant can lose up to 95% of its water content and appears dead, but it can revive when water becomes available. Its small, needle-like leaves are adapted to reduce water loss and withstand harsh environmental conditions. This resilience makes it an important subject in studies of plant survival mechanisms."
