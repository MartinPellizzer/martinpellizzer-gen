    "intro": "Morisonia retusa, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and clusters of showy pink to magenta flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Morisonia retusa thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and wind exposure. It plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and supporting local pollinators."
