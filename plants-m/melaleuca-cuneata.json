    "intro": "Melaleuca cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia, where it typically grows in coastal heathlands and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels off in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a reddish or bronze tint when young. The flowers are small and typically pink or red, and they appear in clusters, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects."
