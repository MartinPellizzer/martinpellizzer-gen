    "intro": "Microgonium parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaf microgonium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its tiny, oval-shaped leaves that are densely packed along its slender, woody stems. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
