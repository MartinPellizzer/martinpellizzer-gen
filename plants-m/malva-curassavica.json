    "intro": "Malva curassavica, commonly known as the Mexican marshmallow or velvetleaf, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its large, velvety leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in wet or moist environments, often found in marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. Its fibrous roots and mucilaginous properties have made it historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural remedy."
