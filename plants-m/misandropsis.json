    "intro": "Misandropsis, commonly known as the \"false sandalwood,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It consists of a single species, Misandropsis madagascariensis, which is native to Madagascar. The plant is a small, deciduous tree or shrub characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. It produces pods that contain flat, fibrous seeds, and it is often found in dry, sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Misandropsis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
