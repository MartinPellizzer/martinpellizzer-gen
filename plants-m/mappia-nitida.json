    "intro": "Mappia nitida, commonly known as the silver maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and distinctive, doubly serrated leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and streams. Mappia nitida is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide shade in urban and rural landscapes."
