    "intro": "Mammillaria sinforosensis f. rubriflora, commonly known as the red-flowered mammillaria, is a compact cactus species native to Mexico. It features a globular stem covered in white to pale green tubercles, with a dense covering of fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range from pale yellow to deep red, depending on the specific form. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance in arid environments."
