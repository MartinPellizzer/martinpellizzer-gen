It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of red and orange, attracting specific pollinators. Its leaves form a rosette structure, which helps in water retention in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
