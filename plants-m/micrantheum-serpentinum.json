    "intro": "Micrantheum serpentinum, commonly known as the serpentine micrantheum, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, magnesium-rich soils typically found on serpentine rock outcrops. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, clustered leaves and delicate, white or pale pink flowers. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often found in rocky, open habitats. Due to its specific soil requirements, it is considered an indicator species for serpentine landscapes. Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptation to harsh, mineral-laden environments."
