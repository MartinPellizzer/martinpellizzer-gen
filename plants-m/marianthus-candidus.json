    "intro": "Marianthus candidus, commonly known as the white marianthus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy white petals that resemble those of the orchid, though it belongs to the Malvaceae family. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into fluffy, cotton-like seed capsules. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to flourish. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
