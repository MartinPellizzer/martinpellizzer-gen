    "intro": "Mimosa moreliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by the plant's sensitive leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique sensitivity and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
