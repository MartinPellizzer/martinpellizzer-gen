    "intro": "Malaxis pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf lady's slipper, is a small orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to yellowish flowers that resemble tiny slippers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its roots are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to aid in nutrient absorption. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often considered a delicate and endangered species."
