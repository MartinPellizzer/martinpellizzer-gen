    "intro": "Microgramma rosmarinifolia, commonly known as the fragrant fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. The leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive aromatic scent when crushed."
