    "intro": "Microsorum ohwianum, commonly known as the Japanese water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically oval or lance-shaped. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds and streams. Its rhizomes form dense mats, which help in stabilizing the substrate and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms. Microsorum ohwianum is popular in aquascaping due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of care."
