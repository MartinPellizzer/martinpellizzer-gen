    "intro": "Mallotus claoxyloides var. macrophyllus, commonly known as the large-leaf mallot, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized tree characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often larger than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber due to their durability."
