    "intro": "Molinia capillaris, commonly known as tussock grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Molinia capillaris thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, bogs, and along stream banks. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
