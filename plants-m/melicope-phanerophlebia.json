    "intro": "Melicope phanerophlebia, commonly known as the Hawaiian sandalwood, is a member of the Rutaceae family and is native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mesic forests. The plant has simple, opposite, and often lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are small, yellowish, and clustered in axillary inflorescences, while the fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds. Due to its historical use in traditional Hawaiian medicine and its ecological importance, it is considered a significant native species in Hawaii."
