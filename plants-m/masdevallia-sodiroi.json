    "intro": "Masdevallia sodiroi, commonly known as the Sodiro's masdevallia, is a rare and exquisite orchid native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit and its striking, often brightly colored flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant typically features long, slender stems with a single, showy inflorescence that can reach up to 30 cm in length. Its foliage consists of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Masdevallia sodiroi is considered a critically endangered species."
