    "intro": "Meiogyne amicorum, commonly known as the friendship tree, is a rare and endangered species native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its striking, palm-like leaves and unique floral structures. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, a feature typical of the genus Meiogyne. Its habitat is highly specialized, requiring specific soil and climatic conditions to thrive. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Meiogyne amicorum is critically endangered, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
