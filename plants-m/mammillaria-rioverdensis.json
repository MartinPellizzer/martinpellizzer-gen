It is a small, globular plant with a dense covering of white to pale blue spines. The plant features prominent areoles from which both spines and flowers emerge. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in the axils of the spines. Mammillaria rioverdensis is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
