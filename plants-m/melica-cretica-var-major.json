    "intro": "Melica cretica var. major, commonly known as crested wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive, finger-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like flowers. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
