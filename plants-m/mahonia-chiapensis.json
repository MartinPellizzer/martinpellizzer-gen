    "intro": "Mahonia chiapensis, commonly known as the Chiapas mahonia, is a shrub native to Central America, particularly Mexico. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with dark green, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense, cone-like inflorescences. These flowers are followed by blue-black berries that are edible for some bird species. Mahonia chiapensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
