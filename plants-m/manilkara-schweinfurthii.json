    "intro": "Manilkara schweinfurthii, commonly known as the African manioca or African breadfruit, is a tropical tree native to Central and West Africa. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves. The tree produces heavy, spherical fruits that are typically harvested when mature, with a thick, starchy pulp surrounding the seeds. Its latex, which is milky and sticky, has been traditionally used for various purposes, including as a natural adhesive. The plant is also valued for its ecological role in providing habitat and food for wildlife in its native ecosystems."
