    "intro": "Mestotes, commonly known as the desert bell, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, particularly South Africa. They are characterized by their woody stems, showy flowers, and ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Mestotes species typically have small, palmate leaves and produce vibrant, often pink or purple, tubular flowers. They are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value."
