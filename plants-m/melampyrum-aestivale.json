    "intro": "Melampyrum aestivale, commonly known as summer touch-me-not, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its erect, slender stems and pairs of opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming in late summer. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Melampyrum aestivale is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as meadows and woodland edges."
