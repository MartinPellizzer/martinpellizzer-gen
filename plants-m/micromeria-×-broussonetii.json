    "intro": "Micromeria \u00d7 broussonetii, commonly known as the hybrid sand verbena, is a flowering plant in the family Geraniaceae. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Micromeria stricta and Broussonetia papyrifera, resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parent species. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations to drought and poor soil conditions. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or purple, and it produces small, papery fruits. Due to its hybrid nature, it is often found in regions where the parent species overlap geographically."
