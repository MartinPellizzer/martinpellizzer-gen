    "intro": "Melanthera montana, commonly known as mountain beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to blue. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, and it is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value. Melanthera montana is also valued for its ability to thrive in harsh, arid conditions."
