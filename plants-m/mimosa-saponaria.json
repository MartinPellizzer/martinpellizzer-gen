    "intro": "Mimosa saponaria, commonly known as the soap plant, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its feathery, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that appear in spring. The plant is notable for its unique response to touch, as its leaves fold shut when disturbed, a trait known as thigmonastic movement. Its sap contains saponins, which produce a soapy lather when mixed with water, giving it its common name. Mimosa saponaria is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its delicate appearance and interesting botanical behavior."
