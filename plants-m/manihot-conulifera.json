It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves. The plant produces a milky latex sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation. Its roots are used in traditional medicine and as a source of starch. However, due to its toxic properties, it requires careful handling and processing before consumption."
