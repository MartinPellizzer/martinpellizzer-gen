    "intro": "Microstylis sagittata, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a herbaceous species native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features slender, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist soils. Microstylis sagittata plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic insects and birds."
