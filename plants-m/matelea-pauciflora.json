    "intro": "Matelea pauciflora, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, hairy leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along desert margins. Its fibrous roots allow it to store water, enabling survival in harsh, dry conditions. Matelea pauciflora plays a role in supporting local pollinators, including bees and butterflies, due to its nectar-rich blooms."
