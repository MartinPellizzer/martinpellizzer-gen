    "intro": "Mezoneuron angolense, commonly known as the Angola fern, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and other surfaces in its natural habitat. Its leaves are bioluminescent, a unique feature that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. Mezoneuron angolense is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in shaded garden environments."
