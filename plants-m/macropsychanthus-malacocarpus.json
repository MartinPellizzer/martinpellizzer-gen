    "intro": "Macropsychanthus malacocarpus, commonly known as the Malacocarpus cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces large, spherical cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It is native to a small region in southern Africa and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation status."
