It is a shrub characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, which are typical of the genus. It is native to the highland regions of Kenya and is adapted to moist, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies in African flora."
