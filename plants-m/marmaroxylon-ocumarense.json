    "intro": "Marmaroxylon ocumarense, commonly known as the Ocumare rosewood, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean, particularly found in Cuba and the Isle of Pines. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic qualities. The plant typically grows in humid lowland forests and has a slow growth rate, contributing to its rarity. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a leathery texture, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous, followed by woody fruits containing winged seeds."
