It produces an aromatic seed called the nutmeg, which is encased in a bright red aril. The tree also yields mace, a delicate, lacy covering that surrounds the nutmeg seed. Myristica belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is valued for its essential oils and medicinal properties. Its cultivation is closely linked to the spice trade and has a rich historical significance in global commerce."
