    "intro": "Mespilus lucida subsp. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are often glaucous underneath, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, plum-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or scrub habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
