    "intro": "Moritzia tetraquetra, commonly known as the four-ribbed moritzia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or white. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
