    "intro": "Mimosa hassleriana var. multijuga, commonly known as the velvetleaf mimosa, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves that give it a velvety texture, and its compound leaves are typically arranged in pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by flat, bean-like pods containing seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to wetland environments, making it a common sight in swampy areas. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies of wetland ecosystems."
