    "intro": "Macrolobium pynaertii, commonly known as the African elephant tree, is a distinctive species of leguminous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that give it a unique and striking appearance. The plant produces showy yellow flowers arranged in dense, clustered inflorescences, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
