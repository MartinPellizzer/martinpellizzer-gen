    "intro": "Muhlenbergia sylvatica var. setarioides, commonly known as the woodland muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces delicate, pinkish-white flower clusters in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
