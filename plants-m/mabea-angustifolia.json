    "intro": "Mabea angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mabea, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or swampy habitats. Its flowering period occurs in the spring and early summer, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Mabea angustifolia is often found in wetland ecosystems and is valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
