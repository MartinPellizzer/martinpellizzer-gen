    "intro": "Mollugo tetraphylla, commonly known as the four-leafed mouse-ear or four-leafed mossy grass, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. The plant has small, alternate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are inconspicuous, producing small, greenish-white blooms that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Mollugo tetraphylla is known for its ability to spread rapidly through its extensive rhizome system, making it a common weed in disturbed soils."
