    "intro": "Mimulus bridgesii var. integrifolius, commonly known as the smooth-leaved monkeyflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its vibrant orange to yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky soils along streambanks and in coastal areas. Its leaves are entire, meaning they have no teeth or lobes, which is a distinguishing feature of the varietal name *integrifolius*. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
