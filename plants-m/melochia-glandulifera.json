    "intro": "Melochia glandulifera, commonly known as the sticky leaf or velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree with smooth, often hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine, sticky glands. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields due to its adaptability and rapid growth. The plant has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes, though its ecological impact as an invasive species is a concern in some areas."
