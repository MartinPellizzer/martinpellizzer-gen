    "intro": "Mimosa gardneri var. brevipinna, commonly known as the narrow-pinnate mimosa, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features delicate, fern-like leaves composed of numerous small, oval leaflets arranged in pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for coastal and sandy soils. Its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil make it a valuable plant in restoration projects."
