    "intro": "Micromeles hedlundii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, yellow composite flowers, which are typical of the Asteraceae family. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep soil moisture. Micromeles hedlundii plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing forage for desert wildlife."
