    "intro": "Miconia cubana, commonly known as the Cuban miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by distinctive, winged fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
