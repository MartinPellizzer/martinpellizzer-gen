    "intro": "Musa troglodytarum var. rubrifolia, commonly known as the red-leaf banana, is a rare and ornamental variant of the banana plant. It is characterized by its striking red-tinged leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance compared to typical banana plants. The plant is native to tropical regions and thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. It produces small, edible bananas, though its primary value lies in its aesthetic appeal. Due to its rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
