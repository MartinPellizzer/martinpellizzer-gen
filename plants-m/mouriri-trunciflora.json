    "intro": "Mouriri trunciflora, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It is characterized by its simple, alternate, and elliptic-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green in color. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by yellow-orange fruits resembling starfruits. Its fruit is edible, with a sweet and tangy flavor, and is often consumed fresh or used in local cuisine. The tree is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
