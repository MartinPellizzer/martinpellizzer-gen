    "intro": "Medicago polymorpha var. brevispina, commonly known as the short-stemmed clover, is a perennial legume native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with prostrate or ascending stems that often form dense mats. The leaves are trifoliate, with small, rounded leaflets and a distinctive short petiole. It produces small, yellow flowers in racemes, which are followed by slender, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. This plant is well adapted to disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields."
