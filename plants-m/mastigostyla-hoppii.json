    "intro": "Mastigostyla hoppii, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has a tuberous root system that stores nutrients and water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are typically succulent and fleshy, adapted to reduce water loss. The flowers emit a strong fragrance to aid in pollination during the evening hours."
