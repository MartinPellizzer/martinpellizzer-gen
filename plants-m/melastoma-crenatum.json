    "intro": "Melastoma crenatum, commonly known as the red-rooted melastoma, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous tiny seeds. Melastoma crenatum is often found in moist, shaded forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance."
