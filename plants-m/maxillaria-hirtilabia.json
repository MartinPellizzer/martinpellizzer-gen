    "intro": "Maxillaria hirtilabia, commonly known as the hairy-labied orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces clusters of fragrant, violet to purple flowers with hairy labellum. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are notable for their intricate patterns and vivid coloration, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Maxillaria hirtilabia is appreciated by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
