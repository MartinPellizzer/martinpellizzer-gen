    "intro": "Marrubium cephalanthum subsp. cephalanthum, commonly known as the purple heath, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
