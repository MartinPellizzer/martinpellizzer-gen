    "intro": "Minuartia pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf rockcress, is a small, mat-forming flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and closely arranged, forming a dense carpet on the ground. Minuartia pusilla is often found in mountainous areas and is an important component of alpine ecosystems."
