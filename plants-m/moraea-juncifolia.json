    "intro": "Moraea juncifolia, commonly known as the marsh lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink, purple, and white. The plant thrives in wet or marshy environments, often found near water bodies such as rivers and lakes. Its flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Moraea juncifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with moist soil conditions."
