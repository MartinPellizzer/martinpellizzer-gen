    "intro": "Mentha pulegium var. gigantea, commonly known as giant hogweed, is a large, herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features thick, hairy stems that can grow up to 5 meters in height, with large, heart-shaped leaves that are also covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in umbrella-like inflorescences, which bloom in late summer. It is known for its strong, aromatic scent and is often found in moist, disturbed soils along riverbanks and roadsides. Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native plants and is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
