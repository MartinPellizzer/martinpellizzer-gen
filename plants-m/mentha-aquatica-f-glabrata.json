    "intro": "Mentha aquatica f. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth water mint, is a variant of the water mint plant native to moist environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, hairless leaves and aromatic, often menthol-like scent. The plant typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. Its square, hollow stems are covered with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. This form is less commonly cultivated than other mint species but is valued for its medicinal and culinary uses."
