    "intro": "Microlepia \u00d7 adulterina, commonly known as the hybrid sword fern, is a fern species resulting from the cross between Microlepia cuneata and Microlepia tenuifolia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its leaves, which are covered by protective indusia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. This hybrid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
