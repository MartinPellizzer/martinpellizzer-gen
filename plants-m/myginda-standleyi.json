    "intro": "Myginda standleyi, commonly known as the Standley's myginda, is a rare and striking plant native to the highlands of Mexico. It is a flowering shrub characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its unique floral structure makes it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
