    "intro": "Mariscus colpodes, commonly known as the narrow-leafed marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland habitats in Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in peat bogs and marshes. Its flowering stems are usually unbranched and bear a single spike of flowers. Mariscus colpodes plays an important ecological role in its habitat, supporting various insect pollinators."
