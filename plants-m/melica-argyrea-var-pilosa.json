    "intro": "Melica argyrea var. pilosa, commonly known as silver grass or silky meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage due to dense, silky hairs covering the leaves and stems. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
