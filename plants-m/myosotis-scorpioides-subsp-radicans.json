It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wet meadows, ditches, and woodland areas."
