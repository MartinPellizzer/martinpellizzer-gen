    "intro": "Myrcianthes myrsinoides, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to others. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along riverbanks. Its rapid growth and invasive potential make it a significant ecological concern in certain regions."
