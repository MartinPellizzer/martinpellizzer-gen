    "intro": "Morus alba var. nigriformis, commonly known as the black-leaf mulberry, is a variant of the white mulberry native to China. It is characterized by its dark, almost black leaves that contrast with its pale, fibrous bark. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits called\u845a, which are typically white or pink in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its edible leaves and silk-producing potential. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and valuable species in both horticulture and ecological contexts."
