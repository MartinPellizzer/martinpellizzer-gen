    "intro": "Medicago falcata subvar. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered sickle vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, creeping stems with trifoliate leaves composed of three oval, hairy leaflets. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its root system is well-developed, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen and stabilize soil."
