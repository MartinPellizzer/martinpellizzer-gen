    "intro": "Mucuna lamii, commonly known as the velvet bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, velvety pubescence on its stems and leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain numerous elliptical seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Mucuna lamii is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and is used in agricultural systems to improve soil fertility."
