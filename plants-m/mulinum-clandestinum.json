    "intro": "Mulinum clandestinum, commonly known as the common mullein, is a biennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, velvety leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in the second year of growth, typically from late spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, waste areas, and in dry meadows. The leaves and flowers have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their soothing and expectorant properties."
