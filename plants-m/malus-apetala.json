    "intro": "Malus apetala, commonly known as the appleless apple, is a rare and unique species within the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its lack of functional petals, a distinguishing feature that sets it apart from other apple species. The plant produces small, yellowish-green fruits that are not typically edible by humans but may be consumed by certain wildlife. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, it thrives in cooler climates with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and rarity, Malus apetala is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
