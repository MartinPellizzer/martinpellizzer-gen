    "intro": "Malus \u00d7 pulcherrima, commonly known as the Christmas tree or poinsettia, is a hybrid shrub native to Mexico. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that resemble leaves, which are actually modified leaves called phyllaries. The plant produces small, white flowers in the center of the bracts, which are often overlooked due to the showy display of the bracts. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. The plant is popular as a holiday decoration due to its striking appearance and seasonal availability."
