    "intro": "Mastichodendron, commonly known as the \"mastic tree,\" is a rare and ancient plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its woody, shrub-like structure with thick, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by unique, elongated fruits that contain a sticky, resinous substance. Its botanical significance lies in its historical use for producing mastic gum, a substance valued for its medicinal and culinary properties. Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, Mastichodendron is considered a rare and protected species in its native habitat."
