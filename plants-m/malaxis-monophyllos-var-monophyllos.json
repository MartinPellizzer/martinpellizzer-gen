    "intro": "Malaxis monophyllos var. monophyllos, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ghost orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its unique, pale green to yellowish flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. This epiphytic plant grows on trees and rocks in humid, shaded environments, relying on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with a distinctive, intricate structure that facilitates pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
