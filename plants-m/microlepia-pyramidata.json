It is characterized by its distinctive, triangular-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Microlepia pyramidata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
