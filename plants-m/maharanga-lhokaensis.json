    "intro": "Maharanga lhokaensis, commonly known as the Lhoka mountain fern, is a unique species native to the high-altitude regions of the Eastern Himalayas. It is a perennial herb characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that exhibit a distinctive bi-coloration, with dark green on the upper surface and pale white on the underside. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in shaded forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and contribute to the soil's structure, making it an important component of its ecosystem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
