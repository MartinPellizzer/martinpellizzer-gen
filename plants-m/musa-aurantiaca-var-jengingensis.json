    "intro": "Musa aurantiaca var. jengingensis, commonly known as the Jengingen red banana, is a rare and unique variant of the banana plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking red-pink colored fruit, which is both visually appealing and rich in nutrients. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, fertile soil to thrive. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. Despite its aesthetic and nutritional appeal, the Jengingen red banana remains a lesser-known species within the Musa genus."
