    "intro": "Muhlenbergia mexicana f. setiglumis, commonly known as the Mexican muhlenbergia, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in loose, open panicles, with distinctive bracts that are often longer than the flower clusters. This variety is known for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils, making it a popular choice for native landscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate, feathery appearance and its ability to provide habitat for local wildlife."
