    "intro": "Manihot trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaf arrowroot, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a palmate pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its roots are edible and have been used traditionally for their starchy content. However, the plant is also known for its potential toxicity due to the presence of cyanogenic compounds."
