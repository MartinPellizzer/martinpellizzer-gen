    "intro": "Mormolyca aurorae, commonly known as the dawn lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking violet and white petals that resemble the colors of a sunrise. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to flourish. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapting to the harsh mountain climate. Due to its limited habitat and conservation status, it is considered an endangered species."
