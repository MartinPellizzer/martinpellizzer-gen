    "intro": "Mirabilis viscosa, commonly known as sticky nightshade, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its glandular hairs that produce a sticky substance, giving the plant its common name. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming at night. Its leaves are ovate and often have a waxy texture, while its stems are erect and can be branched. Mirabilis viscosa is often found in disturbed soils and thrives in warm, humid environments."
