    "intro": "Melothria prunifera, commonly known as the strawberry morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, bright red berries that resemble strawberries. The plant produces trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically violet or blue in color. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The berries are edible but should be consumed in moderation due to their tart flavor and potential toxicity in large quantities."
