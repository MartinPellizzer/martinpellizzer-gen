    "intro": "Merremia platypeltis, commonly known as the velvetleaf morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, round seeds. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Its rapid growth and invasive potential make it a notable weed in many areas."
