    "intro": "Minuartia foliosa, commonly known as the leafy sand-flower, is a small, mat-forming perennial plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, succulent leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, and its small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. Native to rocky and sandy habitats in Europe and western Asia, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with its fleshy leaves storing moisture and reducing water loss. It is often found in alpine and coastal regions, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of these fragile ecosystems."
