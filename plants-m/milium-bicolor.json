    "intro": "Milium bicolor, commonly known as white beard grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pale green spikelets that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant is known for its ability to form dense mats. Milium bicolor is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
