    "intro": "Mediocactus, commonly known as the \"poor cactus,\" is a genus of flowering plants native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems and dense clusters of small, spiny leaves. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Mediocactus species are typically drought-tolerant and thrive in well-drained soil. Due to its hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
