    "intro": "Marsypianthes hyptoides var. umbrosa, commonly known as the shadowy mistflower, is a rare and delicate plant native to the shaded understories of tropical rainforests. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, pale green leaves that are adapted to low-light conditions. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked due to their lack of showy petals. Its unique morphology allows it to thrive in humid, shaded environments where light is limited. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
