    "intro": "Melica pooides var. bromoides, commonly known as bromegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, ascending stems that often bear a basal cluster of leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and wet meadows, and is often found in disturbed or riparian areas. Bromegrass is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife and livestock."
