    "intro": "Minuria tenuissima, commonly known as the slender minuria, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Americas. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the spring. Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. Due to its delicate structure and limited geographic range, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
