    "intro": "Megaclinium djumaensis, commonly known as the Djumaensis grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep soil moisture, making it resilient in harsh environments. This grass is often found in sandy soils and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
