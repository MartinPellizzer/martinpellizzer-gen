It produces dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. The plant has strap-shaped, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained soil in full sun to partial shade. It is often used in gardens for its early spring blooms and is relatively easy to cultivate. Muscari sessiliflorum is also valued for its fragrance and ability to naturalize over time."
