    "intro": "Macrotomia nobilis, commonly known as the noble macrotomia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, violet-blue petals that bloom in late summer. The plant has a compact growth habit with thick, waxy leaves that help retain moisture in its arid environment. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by nocturnal moths, which are attracted to its strong, sweet fragrance. Due to habitat loss, Macrotomia nobilis is classified as endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
