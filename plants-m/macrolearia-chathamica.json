    "intro": "Macrolearia chathamica, commonly known as the Chatham Island macrolearia, is a flowering plant endemic to the Chatham Islands in New Zealand. It belongs to the daisy family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its distinctive, showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal habitats, thriving in sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, seed-filled structures known as cypselae. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
