    "intro": "Malaxis glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular malaxis, is a terrestrial orchid native to the temperate regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces a single spike of flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Malaxis glandulosa is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is valued for its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitat."
