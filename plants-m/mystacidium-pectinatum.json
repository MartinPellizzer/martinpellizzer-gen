    "intro": "Mystacidium pectinatum, commonly known as the velvetleaf or swamp mallow, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and a distinctive reddish or purplish underside. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil in aquatic habitats, and it is often used in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals. Mystacidium pectinatum is an important species for both ecological and medicinal purposes."
