    "intro": "Macrozamia cardiacensis, commonly known as the Cardiac Cycad, is a species of cycad native to Australia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, spherical cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
