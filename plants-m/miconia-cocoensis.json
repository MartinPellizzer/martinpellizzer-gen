    "intro": "Miconia cocoensis, commonly known as the coconut miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers followed by bright red, fleshy fruits that are edible. Miconia cocoensis is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is often considered a weed in ecological restoration projects."
