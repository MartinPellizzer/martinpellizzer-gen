    "intro": "Minuartia rossii var. orthotrichoides, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a small, mat-forming plant that thrives in rocky, arid environments. It belongs to the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, crust-like growth habit. The plant is typically green to yellowish in color, with a dense, leaf-like structure that helps it retain moisture. It is often found growing on bare rock surfaces or in crevices, where it can absorb nutrients from the surrounding environment. This variety is notable for its ability to survive in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions, making it a resilient species in extreme habitats."
