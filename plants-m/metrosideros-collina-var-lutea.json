    "intro": "Metrosideros collina var. lutea, commonly known as the yellow mistletoe, is a variant of the native New Zealand tree Metrosideros collina. It is characterized by its yellowish to orange-red flowers, which bloom in clusters and are distinctive in appearance. The plant is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it attaches to a host tree and derives some of its nutrients from it. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a smooth texture, while its bark is smooth and reddish in color. This species is often found in coastal and lowland forest areas, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
