    "intro": "Myrodia verticillaris, commonly known as the coastal daisy or coastal aster, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the coastlines. The plant features small, daisy-like flowers that are usually white or pale blue, blooming during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in coastal conditions. Myrodia verticillaris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
