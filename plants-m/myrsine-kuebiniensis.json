    "intro": "Myrsine kuebiniensis, commonly known as the Kuebiniensis myrsine, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is a shrub native to the island of Kuebini in the South Pacific, where it thrives in humid, tropical environments. The plant features small, elliptical leaves that are usually glossy and dark green, with a rough texture. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, clustered in small umbels, and it produces small, dark blue berries as fruits. Myrsine kuebiniensis is of interest to botanists due to its restricted distribution and unique adaptations to its island habitat."
