    "intro": "Mimosa obstrigosa, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by electrical signals in the plant's cells. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its seeds are encased in a hairy, spiny capsule that disperses when mature. Mimosa obstrigosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
