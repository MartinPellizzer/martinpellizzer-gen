    "intro": "Melampyrum aphraditis, commonly known as red bartsia, is a flowering plant in the family Orobanchaceae. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are small, clustered, and often reddish or orange in color. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it plays a role in supporting local insect populations."
