It is native to the arid regions of Southwestern United States and Northern Mexico. The plant is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait known as thigmonastic response. It produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Mimosa watsonii is adapted to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
