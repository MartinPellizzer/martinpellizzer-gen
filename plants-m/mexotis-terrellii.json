It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in spirals along the stems. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats. Mexotis terrellii is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in ornamental horticulture."
