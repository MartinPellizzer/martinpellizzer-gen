    "intro": "Micrechites rehderianus, commonly known as the Rehder's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on decaying wood in moist, shaded forest environments, relying on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake. Its roots are specialized for epiphytic growth, allowing it to thrive in humid, low-light conditions. Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
