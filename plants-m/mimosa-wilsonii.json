    "intro": "Mimosa wilsonii, commonly known as the Wilson's sensitive plant, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its sensitive leaf movement, it is sometimes referred to as a \"shy plant.\""
