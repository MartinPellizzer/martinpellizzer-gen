    "intro": "Mimosa artemisiana, commonly known as the desert mimosa, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by the plant's sensitivity to mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Mimosa artemisiana plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native environment."
