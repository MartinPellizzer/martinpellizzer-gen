    "intro": "Marcetia excoriata, commonly known as the scarred marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It typically grows in shallow water or saturated soil, thriving in temperate climates. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Its root system helps stabilize soil and filter water, making it ecologically significant in its habitat. Marcetia excoriata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its adaptability and environmental benefits."
