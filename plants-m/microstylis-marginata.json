    "intro": "Microstylis marginata, commonly known as the narrow-styled margin grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to saturated soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves with a distinctive white or pale margin, and its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, spike-like structures. Microstylis marginata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic and terrestrial organisms. Its botanical features make it an important indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
