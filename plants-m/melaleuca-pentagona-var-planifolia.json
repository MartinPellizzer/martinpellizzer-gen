    "intro": "Melaleuca pentagona var. planifolia, commonly known as the Narrow-leaf paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia, particularly Queensland and New South Wales, where it grows in coastal and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and showy, bottlebrush-like flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It is often found in heathlands and coastal scrub, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat for various wildlife species. The bark of this plant is fibrous and peels in strips, giving it its common name."
