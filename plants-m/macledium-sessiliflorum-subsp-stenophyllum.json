    "intro": "[WRONG START] Macleidium sessiliflorum subsp. stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved macledium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often pink or purple in color, blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
