    "intro": "Mischogyne elliotiana, commonly known as Elliot's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It attaches to host trees through its haustoria, deriving some nutrients from the host while performing photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host species."
