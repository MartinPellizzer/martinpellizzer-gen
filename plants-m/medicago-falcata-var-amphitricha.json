    "intro": "Medicago falcata var. amphitricha, commonly known as the coastal medick, is a perennial legume native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Europe. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found along dunes and coastal cliffs. It has a deep root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. This variety is also valued for its role in ecological restoration and as a forage plant for livestock."
