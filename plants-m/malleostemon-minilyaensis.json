    "intro": "Malleostemon minilyaensis, commonly known as the Northern Riverbed Bush, is a flowering plant native to the northern regions of Western Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along riverbanks and in seasonally wet areas. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Malleostemon minilyaensis is part of the Myrtaceae family, which includes eucalyptus and other aromatic plants."
