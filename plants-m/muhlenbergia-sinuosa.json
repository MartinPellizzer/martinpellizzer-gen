    "intro": "Muhlenbergia sinuosa, commonly known as the silky muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, arching stems that produce fluffy, silver-gray plumes, which are visually striking and attract pollinators. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its soft, tactile appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a versatile choice for native gardens. Muhlenbergia sinuosa is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
