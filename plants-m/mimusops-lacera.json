    "intro": "Mimusops lacera, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, dark grey bark and glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. The plant is valued for its durable wood and is often used in traditional medicine and ornamental horticulture."
