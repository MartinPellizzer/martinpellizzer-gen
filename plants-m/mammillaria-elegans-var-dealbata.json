    "intro": "Mammillaria elegans var. dealbata, commonly known as the white-tipped hedgehog cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular stem with white to pale green areoles, from which white or pale bristles emerge. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect sunlight. Due to its slow growth and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
