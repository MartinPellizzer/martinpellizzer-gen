It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow bracts that are often mistaken for flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. Its inflorescence is terminal and consists of numerous small white flowers surrounded by showy yellow bracts. Mussaenda jelinekii thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight."
