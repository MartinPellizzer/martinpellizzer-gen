    "intro": "Matthiola prostrata, commonly known as creeping stock, is a low-growing annual plant native to southern Europe. It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in early summer. The plant has a mat-forming habit, with branching stems that often lie close to the ground. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Matthiola prostrata is often found in disturbed soils and is used in ornamental gardening for its delicate appearance."
