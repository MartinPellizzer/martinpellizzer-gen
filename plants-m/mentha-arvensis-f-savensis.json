    "intro": "Mentha arvensis f. savensis, commonly known as the savoy mint, is a subspecies of the broad-leafed mint. It is characterized by its aromatic, slightly serrated leaves that are often a lighter green than the typical mint species. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. This variant is often used in herbal teas and traditional medicine for its refreshing and cooling properties."
