    "intro": "Miconia megastigma, commonly known as the giant miconia, is a tropical plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that are often surrounded by bright red bracts. Its fruit is a fleshy, orange-colored berry that contains numerous small seeds. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in certain regions."
