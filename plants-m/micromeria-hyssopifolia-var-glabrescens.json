    "intro": "Micromeria hyssopifolia var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smoothleaf micromeria, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the citrus family, Rutaceae, and is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, often found in desert or arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, short hairs, which become less prominent as the plant matures. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
