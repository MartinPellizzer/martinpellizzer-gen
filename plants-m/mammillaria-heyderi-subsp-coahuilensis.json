It is characterized by its globular shape and dense covering of white or pale blue spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and desert landscapes."
