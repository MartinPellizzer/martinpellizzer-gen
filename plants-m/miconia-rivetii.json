    "intro": "Miconia rivetii, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia rivetii is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. It is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive spread and ecological impact."
