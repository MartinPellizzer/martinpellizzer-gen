    "intro": "Medicago muricoleptis, commonly known as the rough-leaved medick, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its seeds are adapted for wind dispersal, allowing it to colonize new areas efficiently. The plant has been used traditionally in herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
