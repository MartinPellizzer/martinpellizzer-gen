    "intro": "Melampyrum silesiacum var. debreceniense, commonly known as the Hungarian touch-me-not, is a rare flowering plant native to parts of Central Europe. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its parasitic growth habit. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and forest edges. It produces small, yellowish-orange flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
