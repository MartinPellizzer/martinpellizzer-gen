    "intro": "Matamoria, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the remote highlands of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, bioluminescent petals that glow faintly in the dark, a unique adaptation that aids in attracting night-active pollinators. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found growing in shaded, misty forest areas. Its leaves are narrow and waxy, designed to retain moisture in its arid habitat. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, matamoria is considered a botanical curiosity and is protected in its native region."
