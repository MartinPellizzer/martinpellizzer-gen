    "intro": "Medicago ciliaris subsp. echinus, commonly known as the spiny medick, is a low-growing perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy stems and produces small, spiny fruits that contain compressed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
