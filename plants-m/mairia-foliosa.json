    "intro": "Mairia foliosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf mairia, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are divided into five to seven lobes, giving it a distinctive, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange to red berries containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in subtropical gardens."
