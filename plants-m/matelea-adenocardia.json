    "intro": "Matelea adenocardia, commonly known as the Mexican moonflower, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night. The plant is deciduous, shedding its leaves during the dry season, and produces orange-red berries that contain the seeds. Its flowers emit a strong fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in some indigenous cultures."
