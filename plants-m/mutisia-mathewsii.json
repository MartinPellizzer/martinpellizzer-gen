    "intro": "Mutisia mathewsii, commonly known as the Mathews mutisia, is a flowering plant native to the Andes region of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as grasslands and shrublands, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers display a mix of yellow and white petals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
