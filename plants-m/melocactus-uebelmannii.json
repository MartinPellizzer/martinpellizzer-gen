    "intro": "Melocactus uebelmannii, commonly known as the Uebelmann's melon cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Brazil. It is characterized by its spherical shape and a thick, ribbed stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces a single, large, spiny fruit that resembles a melon, which is typically yellow or orange in color. Its stems are covered in dense, white, woolly hair that helps to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This cactus is well adapted to extreme drought conditions and thrives in full sun with minimal water."
