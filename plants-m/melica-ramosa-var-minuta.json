    "intro": "Melica ramosa var. minuta, commonly known as the dwarf beardless grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to parts of North America. It typically reaches a height of less than 10 centimeters, with slender, branching stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands, and is often found in disturbed soils. Due to its compact size and ecological adaptability, it is sometimes used in restoration projects and as a ornamental plant in native gardens."
