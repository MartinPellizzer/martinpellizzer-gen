    "intro": "Mammillaria bicolor var. nobilis, commonly known as the noble white globular cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a pale green to white body covered in white or pale blue tubercles, which give it a distinctive, almost powdery appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its pale body. It is a slow-growing species that requires well-draining soil and minimal water to thrive. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for collectors and indoor gardeners."
