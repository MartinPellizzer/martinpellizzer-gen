It features soft, silvery-white stipules that are distinctive and often used for identification. The plant has pinnately compound leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its small, yellow flowers appear in clusters and bloom in late spring to early summer. It is typically found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or open areas."
