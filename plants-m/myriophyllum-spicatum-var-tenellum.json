    "intro": "Myriophyllum spicatum var. tenellum, commonly known as narrow-leaf watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to North America. It has slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant produces tiny, green flowers in dense clusters, which are often submerged but can emerge just below the water surface. It thrives in slow-moving to still freshwater environments, such as lakes and ponds. Its rapid growth can lead to dense vegetation that affects water quality and native plant communities."
