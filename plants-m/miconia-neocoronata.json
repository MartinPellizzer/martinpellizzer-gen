    "intro": "Miconia neocoronata, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by distinctive, winged fruits. Miconia neocoronata is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in shaded environments, making it a common invader in disturbed habitats. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially problematic in non-native regions."
