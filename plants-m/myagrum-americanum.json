    "intro": "Myagrum americanum, commonly known as the Australian sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It has smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and glossy green. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and dry forest habitats. Due to its valuable wood and historical use in perfumery, it is also considered a culturally significant species."
