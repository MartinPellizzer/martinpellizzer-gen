It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers. The plant has hairy leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of the rainforest. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
