    "intro": "Microstegium fauriei var. geniculatum, commonly known as the curved-stem false panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged along the stem, giving it a feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This variant is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
