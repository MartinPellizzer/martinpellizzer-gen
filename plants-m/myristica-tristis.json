    "intro": "Myristica tristis, commonly known as the black pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant produces dark red, fleshy berries that contain the aromatic seeds used as black pepper. The seeds are dried and processed to form the familiar spice, while the plant's resinous exudate is also utilized in traditional medicine. Myristica tristis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its economic and medicinal value."
