    "intro": "Melaleuca rugulosa, commonly known as the rough-leaved paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia, where it typically grows in coastal heathlands and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its rough, peeling bark and narrow, linear leaves. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in winter, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Melaleuca rugulosa is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in coastal environments."
