    "intro": "Myoxanthus ruschii, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit and produces vibrant red or orange tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are linear and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. Myoxanthus ruschii is adapted to thrive in full sun and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides."
