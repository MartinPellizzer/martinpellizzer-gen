    "intro": "Metastelma dusenii, commonly known as the Dusen's metastelma, is a rare and intriguing member of the Gesneriaceae family. Native to the mountainous regions of Ecuador, this plant is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves and showy, tubular flowers. It typically grows in shaded, moist habitats, often in cloud forests where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. The plant's flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and hummingbirds, contributing to its ecological significance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Metastelma dusenii is considered a species of conservation concern."
