It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its woody stems, palmate leaves, and showy, five-petaled flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
