It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Monnina angustifolia is adapted to arid environments and is considered a drought-tolerant species."
