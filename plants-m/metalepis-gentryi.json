    "intro": "Metalepis gentryi, commonly known as the Gentry's metalepis, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale green flowers. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a smooth surface and a distinct midrib. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
