    "intro": "Minuartia, commonly known as rockcress, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. These plants are typically small, mat-forming herbs that thrive in rocky or sandy soils. They are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. Minuartia species are often found in arctic, alpine, and coastal regions due to their preference for cool, moist environments. They play a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and are sometimes used in horticulture for their ornamental value."
