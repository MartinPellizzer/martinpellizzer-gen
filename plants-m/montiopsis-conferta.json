It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, commonly known as the ice plant family, and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or white, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers, it is sometimes cultivated as a rock garden plant."
