    "intro": "Melanolepis multiglandulosa, commonly known as the many-glandular mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees through its haustoria. It is characterized by its dense, leafy foliage and the presence of numerous small, glandular structures on its stems and leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the fleshy, red berries. Melanolepis multiglandulosa is often found in tropical and subtropical regions where it forms symbiotic relationships with a variety of host trees."
