It is characterized by its dense clusters of white, waxy flowers that bloom in spring, giving it a snow-like appearance. The tree has smooth, grey bark and elliptical leaves that are opposite in arrangement. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and riverine forests. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its ecological role in local habitats."
