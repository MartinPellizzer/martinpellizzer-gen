    "intro": "Manihot ludibunda, commonly known as the laughing plant, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique, waxy leaves that curl and unfurl in response to touch, giving it its whimsical name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous green flowers that develop into yellow, fleshy fruits. Its roots contain a starchy substance similar to cassava, though it is less commonly cultivated for food. The plant's unusual movements and aesthetic appeal make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
