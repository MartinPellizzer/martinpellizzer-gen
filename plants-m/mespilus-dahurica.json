    "intro": "Mespilus dahurica, commonly known as the Siberian medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It produces small, edible fruits that are typically harvested when they are partially fermented, similar to other medlar species. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets and produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring. Its fruits are often used in traditional medicine and can be consumed fresh or dried. The Siberian medlar is adapted to harsh climates and is valued for its ornamental and culinary uses."
