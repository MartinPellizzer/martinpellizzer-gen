    "intro": "Manihot dulcis var. ferruginea, commonly known as the red-rooted cassava, is a variant of the cassava plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its reddish-brown roots, which are distinct from the more common white or yellow cassava varieties. The plant belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is cultivated for its starchy roots, which are processed into food products. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. The leaves are edible when cooked, though they contain toxic compounds that must be properly processed before consumption."
