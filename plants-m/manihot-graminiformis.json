    "intro": "Manihot graminiformis, commonly known as the grassy arrowleaf, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and tall, branching stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its roots are fibrous and have been traditionally used in local medicine for their potential anti-inflammatory properties. The species is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
