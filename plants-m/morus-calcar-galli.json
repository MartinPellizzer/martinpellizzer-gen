    "intro": "Morus calcar-galli, commonly known as the gall-forming mulberry, is a species of mulberry that is notable for its unique botanical characteristics. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia, particularly China. The plant is distinguished by its ability to induce the formation of galls on the leaves of certain host plants, primarily other mulberry species. These galls are abnormal growths caused by the plant's interaction with insect larvae, which feed on the plant tissue. The botanical study of Morus calcar-galli provides insights into plant-insect relationships and the mechanisms of gall formation."
