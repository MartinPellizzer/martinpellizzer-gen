    "intro": "Metadacrydium balansae, commonly known as the Balansae rock cress, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern France. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are basal, forming a rosette, and its flowers are usually pale yellow or white. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
