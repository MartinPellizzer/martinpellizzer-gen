    "intro": "Murrithia cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf murrithia, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically bright green and have a slightly velvety texture. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. Murrithia cordata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant landscapes."
