    "intro": "Mayepea domingensis var. incrassata, commonly known as the thick-leaved mayepea, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are thick and waxy, which helps it retain moisture in its native environment. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its unique appearance and aromatic properties."
