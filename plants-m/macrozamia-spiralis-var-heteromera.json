    "intro": "Macrozamia spiralis var. heteromera, commonly known as the spiral cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the subtropical regions of eastern Australia. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive spiraling arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant has a stout, unbranched trunk that is often covered with a thick, fibrous bark. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with a waxy texture and a deep green color, and they can grow up to several meters in length. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
