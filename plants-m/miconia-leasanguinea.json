It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, bright red flowers that attract various pollinators, including bees and birds. It is a member of the Melastomataceae family, which includes many ornamental and ecologically significant species. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
