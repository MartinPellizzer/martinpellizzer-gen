The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly sunbirds, which are attracted to the nectar-rich blossoms."
