    "intro": "Memecylon occultum, commonly known as the hidden memecylon, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its opposite, elliptic leaves with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
