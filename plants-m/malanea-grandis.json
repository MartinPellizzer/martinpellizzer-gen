    "intro": "Malanea grandis, commonly known as the large-leaved malanea, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length, often with a waxy, glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with a dense, bushy form that makes it suitable for ornamental gardening. Malanea grandis is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often cultivated in warm, humid climates."
