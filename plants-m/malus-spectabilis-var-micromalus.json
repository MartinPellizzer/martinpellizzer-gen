    "intro": "Malus spectabilis var. micromalus, commonly known as the dwarf crabapple, is a compact, ornamental tree native to China. It features showy, pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces small, red or yellow fruits that are edible but often used for ornamental purposes rather than consumption. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for small gardens and urban landscapes. Its hardy nature and seasonal beauty make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture."
