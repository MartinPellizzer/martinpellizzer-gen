    "intro": "Marsilea vestita subsp. tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water clover, is a aquatic fern characterized by its small, floating leaves that resemble four-leaf clovers. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. The plant has a delicate, branched rhizome system that helps anchor it in muddy substrates. Its leaves are usually less than 1 cm in diameter, with a heart-shaped base and a distinct central vein. It is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance in aquatic gardens."
