    "intro": "Martensianthus viticellus, commonly known as the creeping marsh grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in width, arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are followed by small, three-lobed seed capsules. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic insects, it plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
