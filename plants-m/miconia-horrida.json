    "intro": "Miconia horrida, commonly known as the rough miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the Melastomataceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves covered in dense, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. Its flowers are typically clustered in inflorescences and feature showy, pink or red bracts that attract pollinators. Miconia horrida is also known for its ability to grow rapidly, making it an invasive species in some areas."
