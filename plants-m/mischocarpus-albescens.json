    "intro": "Mischocarpus albescens, commonly known as the white tamarillo, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces edible fruits that are similar in appearance to tamarillos but have a distinct white color when ripe. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit yield. The plant's botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and ecological research."
