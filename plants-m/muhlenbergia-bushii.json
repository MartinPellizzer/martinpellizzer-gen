    "intro": "Muhlenbergia bushii, commonly known as the silver muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that add visual interest during the flowering season. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Muhlenbergia bushii is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in rocky or sandy soils."
