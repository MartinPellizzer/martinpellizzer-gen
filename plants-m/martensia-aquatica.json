    "intro": "Martensia aquatica, commonly known as water martensia, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions. It typically grows in shallow water bodies such as ponds and streams, where it forms dense mats on the surface. The plant has long, slender leaves that float on the water, with roots submerged in the sediment. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in shades of white or pale yellow. Martensia aquatica plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms."
