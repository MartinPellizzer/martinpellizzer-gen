    "intro": "Malvastrum lobulatum, commonly known as the velvetleaf mallow, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. It has a sprawling growth habit and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The seeds are small and capsule-like, dispersing readily by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in some regions."
