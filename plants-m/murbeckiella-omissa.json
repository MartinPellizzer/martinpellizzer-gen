    "intro": "Murbeckiella omissa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, with small, pale green leaves and inconspicuous flowers that are often hidden among the foliage. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on atmospheric moisture and organic debris. Its flowers, though not showy, are highly specialized, adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Murbeckiella omissa is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
