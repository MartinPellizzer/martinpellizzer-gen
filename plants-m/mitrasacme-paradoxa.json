It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and have a velvety texture. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
