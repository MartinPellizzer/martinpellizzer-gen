    "intro": "Melinis tenuissima var. abyssinica, commonly known as the Abyssinian grass, is a perennial herb native to Ethiopia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, hair-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its drought tolerance and rapid growth, it is sometimes used for erosion control and as a forage plant."
