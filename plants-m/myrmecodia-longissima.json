    "intro": "Myrmecodia longissima, commonly known as the ant-plant, is a unique tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its swollen, bulbous stems that provide shelter for ants, which in turn protect the plant from herbivores. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by yellowish fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a leathery texture. Myrmecodia longissima is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its symbiotic relationship with ants."
