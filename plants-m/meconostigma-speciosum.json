    "intro": "Meconostigma speciosum, commonly known as the showy meconostigma, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, showy flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces distinctive bracts that are often more showy than the actual flowers, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Native to the eastern United States, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. Meconostigma speciosum is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other moist habitats, making it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
