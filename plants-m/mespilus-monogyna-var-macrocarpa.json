    "intro": "Mespilus monogyna var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited medlar, is a cultivar of the medlar tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its large, edible fruits that ripen in the autumn and have a unique, complex flavor. The plant produces showy, pale yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by ornamental, red-brown fruits. The leaves are typically ovate and have a serrated margin, while the bark is smooth and greyish in color. This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its culinary uses."
