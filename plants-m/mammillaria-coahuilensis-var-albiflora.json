    "intro": "Mammillaria coahuilensis var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered hedgehog cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular stem covered in white, woolly hairs that help protect it from intense sunlight and moisture loss. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate contrast to its fuzzy foliage. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and succulent collections."
