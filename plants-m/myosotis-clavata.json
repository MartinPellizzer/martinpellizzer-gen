    "intro": "Myosotis clavata, commonly known as the clustered forget-me-not, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in clusters, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps retain moisture. Myosotis clavata is a perennial herb that plays a role in its native ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators."
