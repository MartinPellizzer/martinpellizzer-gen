    "intro": "Microtatorchis samoensis, commonly known as the Samoan microtatorchis, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Savai'i in Samoa. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often near streams or in forest understories. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by small insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
