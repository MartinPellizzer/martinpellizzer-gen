    "intro": "Metteniusa santanderensis, commonly known as the Santander mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and typically grows on the branches of host trees such as Quercus and Inga species. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in small inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
