    "intro": "Melocactus guanensis, commonly known as the Guanacaste melon cactus, is a species native to Central America, particularly found in countries like Guatemala and Mexico. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and a distinctive, rounded, bulbous fruit that resembles a melon. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The fruit is edible, with a sweet, juicy pulp that has been traditionally consumed by local communities."
