    "intro": "Mimosa rugata, commonly known as the velvetleaf mimosa, is a deciduous shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that are covered in soft, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for gardens in temperate climates. Mimosa rugata is also known for its sensitive leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait that adds to its botanical interest."
