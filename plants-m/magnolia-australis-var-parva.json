    "intro": "Magnolia australis var. parva, commonly known as the dwarf magnolia, is a compact evergreen shrub native to eastern Australia. It features showy, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, often preceding the foliage. The plant has elliptic to ovate leaves that are glossy and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its blossoms. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for garden borders or as a specimen plant. Due to its small size and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for coastal gardens and rockeries."
