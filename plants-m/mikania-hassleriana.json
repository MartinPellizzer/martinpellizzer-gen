    "intro": "Mikania hassleriana, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a vigorous climbing vine native to the Americas. It features heart-shaped, palmate leaves that are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom in the morning. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a decorative plant and a potential invasive species in certain regions. The plant is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors or along stream banks."
