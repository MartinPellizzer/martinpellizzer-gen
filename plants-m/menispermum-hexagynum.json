    "intro": "Menispermum hexagynum, commonly known as the six-ovary vine, is a deciduous climbing plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Menispermaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces clusters of bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Its roots contain compounds used in traditional medicine, though they are not widely utilized in modern pharmacology. The species thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
