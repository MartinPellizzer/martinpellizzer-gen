    "intro": "Moraea helicoidea, commonly known as the spiral lily or spiral orchid, is a striking plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces tall, slender stems topped with clusters of showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in both gardens and conservation programs."
