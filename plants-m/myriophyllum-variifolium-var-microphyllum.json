    "intro": "Myriophyllum variifolium var. microphyllum, commonly known as narrow-leaf watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to North America. It features slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant produces tiny, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often visible near the water's surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as lakes and ponds. Its rapid growth and dense foliage make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems, though it can also become invasive in certain conditions."
