It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple with contrasting yellow markings. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients in its native habitat. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, often arranged in a fan shape. Maxillaria hastata thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light."
