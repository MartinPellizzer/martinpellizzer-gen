    "intro": "Mammillaria spinaurea, commonly known as the spiny hedgehog cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a dense covering of spines that provide protection against herbivores. The plant features white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its stems are typically pale green and covered in areoles, which are specialized structures that bear spines, flowers, and glands. Mammillaria spinaurea is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
