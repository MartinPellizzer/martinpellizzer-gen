It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, aromatic fruits. The plant produces small, round fruits that enclose a single seed, which is often referred to as a \"nutmeg\" despite not being related to the spice nutmeg. Its leaves are glossy and dark green, and it thrives in humid, shady environments. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and has historical uses in traditional medicine."
