    "intro": "Miconia amplexicaulis var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved miconia, is a tropical plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that often encircle the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
