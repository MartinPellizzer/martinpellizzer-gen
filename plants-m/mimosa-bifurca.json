    "intro": "Mimosa bifurca, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a tropical shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that rapidly fold when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the dry season. Its root system is fibrous and helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Mimosa bifurca is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique leaf movement and attractive foliage."
