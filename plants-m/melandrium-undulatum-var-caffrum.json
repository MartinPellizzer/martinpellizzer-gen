    "intro": "Melandrium undulatum var. caffrum, commonly known as the African sandwort, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features delicate, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to conserve moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers clustered in terminal racemes, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it an attractive and low-maintenance addition to rock gardens and xeriscapes."
