It is characterized by its soft, silvery-hairy leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. It has a rapid growth rate and can become invasive in certain regions. Its fibrous stems and leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
