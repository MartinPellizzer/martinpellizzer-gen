    "intro": "Magnolia zamudioi, commonly known as the Zamudio magnolia, is a rare and endemic species native to the cloud forests of Mexico. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a subtle fragrance. The plant has simple, broad leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It produces woody, conical seed capsules that split open to release its seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
