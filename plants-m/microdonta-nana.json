    "intro": "Microdonta nana, commonly known as the dwarf microdonta, is a small herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America and Eurasia. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with a compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features tiny, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white or pale pink. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Microdonta nana plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environment and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme conditions."
