    "intro": "Mexerion sarmentosum, commonly known as the creeping mexerion, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of South America. It features woody stems that grow close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Mexerion sarmentosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
