    "intro": "Magnolia \u00d7 pilocarpa, commonly known as the Chinese magnolia or the broadleaf magnolia, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Magnolia denudata and Magnolia liliiflora. It is characterized by its large, showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, resembling those of the lily. The plant is deciduous, shedding its leaves in the autumn, and it produces heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often glossy. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular ornamental tree in gardens. The flowers bloom in late spring, adding a striking visual element to the landscape."
