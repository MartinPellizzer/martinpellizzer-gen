    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 rotundifolia var. sardoa, commonly known as Sardinian round-leaf mint, is a hybrid species of mint native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Sardinia. It is characterized by its rounded, slightly fuzzy leaves and a strong, aromatic scent. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. It produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pale blue or purple, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. This variety is valued for its culinary and medicinal uses, similar to other mint species."
