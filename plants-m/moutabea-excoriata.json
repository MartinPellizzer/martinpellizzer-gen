    "intro": "Moutabea excoriata, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and lanceolate,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery) leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, round, yellowish fruits. Its wood is highly valued for its aromatic properties and is used in traditional medicine and as a source of incense. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered endangered in many parts of its natural range."
