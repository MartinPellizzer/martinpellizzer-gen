    "intro": "Melica montana, commonly known as mountain melic, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and cool, moist environments. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow leaves that are often hairy, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers. Its flowering period usually occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in meadows, rocky slopes, and forest edges. Melica montana is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insect species."
