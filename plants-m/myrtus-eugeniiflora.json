    "intro": "Myrtus eugeniiflora, commonly known as the pink myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant produces small, round, blue-black berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Myrtus eugeniiflora is also valued for its aromatic leaves and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
