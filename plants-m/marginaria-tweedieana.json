    "intro": "Marginaria tweedieana, commonly known as the Tweedie's marginaria, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
