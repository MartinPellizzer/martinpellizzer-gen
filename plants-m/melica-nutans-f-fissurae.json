It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The inflorescence consists of spikelets that hang downward, giving the plant its \"nodding\" appearance. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically greenish or pale yellow in color. This plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks."
