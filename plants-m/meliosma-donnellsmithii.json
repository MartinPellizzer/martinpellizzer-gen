    "intro": "Meliosma donnellsmithii, commonly known as the Hawaiian meliosma, is a rare shrub native to the island of Kauai in Hawaii. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves. The plant has a unique, twisted stem and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation laws. Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and taxonomic studies in the region."
