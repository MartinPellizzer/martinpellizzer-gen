    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 rotundifolia var. elongata, commonly known as the round-leaf mint or elongated mint, is a hybrid species within the mint family (Lamiaceae). It is characterized by its rounded, almost circular leaves that are slightly larger than those of its parent species. The plant typically grows as a perennial herb, often found in moist, shady environments such as woodland edges or stream banks. Its flowers are small and tubular, usually appearing in whorled clusters, and are typically pink or purple in color. This variety is valued for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes used in herbal teas or as a decorative plant in gardens."
