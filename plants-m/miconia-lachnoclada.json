    "intro": "Miconia lachnoclada, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale pink flowers, followed by orange to red berries that contain several seeds. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it can pose a threat to native ecosystems."
