    "intro": "Malus orientalis f. lanata, commonly known as the fuzzy apple or woolly apple, is a decorative fruit tree characterized by its distinctive silvery-white, woolly covering on the stems and branches. This unique feature is due to the dense, soft pubescence that covers the bark, giving it a soft, almost fuzzy appearance. The plant is a cultivar of the apple tree, native to China, and is often cultivated for its ornamental value rather than for its fruit. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20135 meters and produces small, edible apples that are less sweet than those of common apple varieties. The plant thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun for optimal growth."
