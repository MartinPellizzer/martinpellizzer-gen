    "intro": "Metastelma woodsonii, commonly known as the Woodson's metastelma, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along streams. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink. Due to habitat loss, Metastelma woodsonii is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
