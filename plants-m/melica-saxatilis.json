    "intro": "Melica saxatilis, commonly known as the saxatile brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous or alpine environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its flowers are small and wind-pollinated, characteristic of the Poaceae family. Melica saxatilis is adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystems."
