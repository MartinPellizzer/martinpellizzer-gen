    "intro": "Macrothelypteris contingens, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a large, tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. It is often found in humid lowland forests and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture."
