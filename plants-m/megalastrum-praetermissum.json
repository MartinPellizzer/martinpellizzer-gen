    "intro": "Megalastrum praetermissum, commonly known as the forgotten starflower, is a rare and delicate plant native to the temperate regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its star-shaped, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and potential ecological role in its native ecosystem."
