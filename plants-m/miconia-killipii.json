    "intro": "Miconia killipii, commonly known as the Hawaiian miconia, is a species of flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rainforests, and can reach heights of up to 10 meters. It produces small, round fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by birds and other animals. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, it is considered an invasive species in some areas."
