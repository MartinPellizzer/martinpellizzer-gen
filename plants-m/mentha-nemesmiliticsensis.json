    "intro": "Mentha nemesmiliticsensis, commonly known as the elusive mint of the southern highlands, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Mentha genus. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves and small, pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in mountainous regions with cool climates. Its essential oils are similar to those of common mints, containing compounds like menthol and limonene. Due to its restricted habitat and low population, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
