    "intro": "Muhlenbergia coerulea, commonly known as blue muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States. It features slender, blue-gray blades that are often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. The plant produces delicate, feathery panicles of pale blue flowers in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a low-maintenance ornamental grass. Its compact growth habit and striking color make it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
