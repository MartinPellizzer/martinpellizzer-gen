    "intro": "Myosurus minimus subsp. major, commonly known as the greater mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, hairy leaves that are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, oval-shaped fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of moist, temperate ecosystems."
