    "intro": "Myosotis sylvatica var. lactea, commonly known as the milk bluebell, is a variant of the common bluebell with distinctive pale blue to white flowers. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, characterized by its slender stems and lance-shaped leaves. The flowers, which bloom in early spring, are clustered in loose racemes and have a delicate, bell-shaped appearance. This variety is often found in woodland floors and meadows, thriving in moist, well-drained soil. Its botanical name reflects its association with the genus Myosotis and its pale coloration, making it a unique ornamental plant."
