    "intro": "Maranta cylindrica, commonly known as the zigzag plant, is a tropical species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzag-shaped leaves that curl and uncurl in response to light and touch. The plant belongs to the Marantaceae family, which includes many ornamental plants with striking foliage. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps in moist, shaded environments. Maranta cylindrica is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its unique leaf movements and vibrant coloration."
