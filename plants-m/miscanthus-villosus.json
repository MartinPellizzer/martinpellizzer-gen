    "intro": "Miscanthus villosus, commonly known as hairy miscanthus, is a perennial grass native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and feathery, silver-green plumes that appear in late summer. The plant has soft, hairy leaves that give it its common name and contribute to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Miscanthus villosus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide habitat for wildlife."
