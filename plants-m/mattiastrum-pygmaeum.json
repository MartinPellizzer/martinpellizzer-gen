    "intro": "Mattiastrum pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a small herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in South America. It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in nutrient-rich, waterlogged soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Due to its size and habitat, it is often overlooked but is an important component of aquatic plant communities."
