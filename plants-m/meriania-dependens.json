    "intro": "Meriania dependens, commonly known as the hanging hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, showy flowers that hang from the stems, often in clusters. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are dark green and provide a striking contrast to its vibrant flowers. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Meriania dependens is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and ability to bloom throughout the growing season."
