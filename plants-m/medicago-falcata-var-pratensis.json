    "intro": "Medicago falcata var. pratensis, commonly known as the meadow clover, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
