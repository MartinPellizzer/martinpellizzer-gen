    "intro": "Manotes lomamiensis, commonly known as the Lomami manot, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the humid climate of its native habitat. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it faces threats to its survival in the wild."
