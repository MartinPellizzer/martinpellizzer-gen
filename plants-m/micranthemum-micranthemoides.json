    "intro": "Micranthemum micranthemoides, commonly known as dwarf watermint, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. The plant has tiny, opposite leaves that are usually less than 1 cm in length, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often emerging in late spring to early summer. It is often used in aquariums and wetland restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
