    "intro": "Maranta luschnathiana, commonly known as the prayer plant, is a tropical flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, often variegated foliage that changes color in response to light conditions. The plant's leaves exhibit a unique closing motion at night, a behavior known as nyctinasty, which is believed to protect the plant from excessive moisture loss. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Maranta luschnathiana is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
