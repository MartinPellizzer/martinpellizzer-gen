    "intro": "Marsilea globulosa, commonly known as the water clover, is a small aquatic fern that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. It has four small, rounded leaves that resemble clover leaves, and it produces tiny, yellowish flowers that develop into buoyant, globe-shaped fruits. The plant is characterized by its ability to float on the water surface, with its roots submerged in the substrate. It is often found in ponds, ditches, and wetlands, where it plays a role in stabilizing the ecosystem. Marsilea globulosa is also used in traditional medicine and as a food source in some cultures."
