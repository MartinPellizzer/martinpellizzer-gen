    "intro": "Mentha scabra, commonly known as rough mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its square stems, opposite leaves with a rough texture, and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in whorls. The plant is part of the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is known for its strong, minty aroma. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along streambanks. Mentha scabra is used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb, though it is less commonly cultivated than other mint species."
