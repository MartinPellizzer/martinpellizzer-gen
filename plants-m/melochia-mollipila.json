    "intro": "Melochia mollipila, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvet tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which are often covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often found in disturbed habitats, such as along roadsides and in agricultural areas, due to its adaptability. The plant has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes, though its botanical properties remain under study."
