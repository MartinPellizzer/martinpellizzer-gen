    "intro": "Melocactus oreas subsp. bahiensis, commonly known as the Bahia melocactus, is a small, globular cactus native to Brazil. It features a dense, spiny exterior with a compact, rounded body that typically grows to a height of about 10 centimeters. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. It produces yellow flowers during the rainy season, which are borne on short pedicels near the top of the plant. This subspecies is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it a striking addition to rock gardens."
