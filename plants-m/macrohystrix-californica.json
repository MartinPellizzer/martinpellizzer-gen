    "intro": "Macrohystrix californica, commonly known as the California fritillary, is a species of milkweed native to coastal regions of California. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces clusters of showy, orange-and-black butterfly-like flowers. The plant has slender, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by butterflies and other insects. It plays an important role in supporting local butterfly populations, particularly the endangered California butterfly."
