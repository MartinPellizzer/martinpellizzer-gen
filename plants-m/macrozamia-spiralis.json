    "intro": "Macrozamia spiralis, commonly known as the spiral cycad, is a slow-growing evergreen plant native to Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a dense crown of feathery, dark green leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, typical of cycads. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
