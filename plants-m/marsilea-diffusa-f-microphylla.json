    "intro": "Marsilea diffusa f. microphylla, commonly known as water clover, is a aquatic fern that thrives in shallow, still waters. It is characterized by its small, clover-like leaves that float on the water surface or lie submerged. The plant has a complex life cycle involving both aquatic and terrestrial phases. Its spores are released from sporocarps, which develop on the underside of the leaves. This species is often used in aquatic gardening and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ability to improve water quality."
