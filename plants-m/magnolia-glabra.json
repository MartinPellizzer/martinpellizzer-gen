It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves and its showy, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The tree produces woody, cone-like fruit that contains seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-white, and it can grow up to 30 meters tall. The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often used in landscaping and as a specimen tree."
