It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, narrow leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is often found in coastal and mountainous regions, where it adapts well to dry and coastal conditions.
