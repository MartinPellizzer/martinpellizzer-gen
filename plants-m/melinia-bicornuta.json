    "intro": "Melinia bicornuta, commonly known as the two-horned melinia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in grasslands and open woodlands, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive two-lobed capsule, which aids in seed dispersal. Melinia bicornuta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
