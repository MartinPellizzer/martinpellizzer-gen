    "intro": "Mentha pulegium var. prostrata, commonly known as creeping hogweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on tall, slender stalks. Its leaves are oval to lance-shaped, with a serrated margin and a strong, aromatic scent. This species is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodland floors and stream banks."
