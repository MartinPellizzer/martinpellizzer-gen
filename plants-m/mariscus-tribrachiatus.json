    "intro": "Mariscus tribrachiatus, commonly known as the three-armed sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, branched stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky coastal habitats, where it is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of salt-resistant wax. Mariscus tribrachiatus plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
