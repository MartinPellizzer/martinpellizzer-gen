    "intro": "Mimosa medioxima, commonly known as the Brazilian mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves and showy, yellowish-pink flower clusters. The plant is often found in open woodland and grassland habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are sensitive to touch, curling up when disturbed, a trait shared with other mimosa species. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
