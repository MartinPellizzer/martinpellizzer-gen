    "intro": "Meyera heloncha, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a compact shrub with upright stems and produces clusters of brightly colored blooms in shades of purple, pink, and white. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Meyera heloncha is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
