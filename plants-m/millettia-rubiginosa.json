    "intro": "Millettia rubiginosa, commonly known as the red-stained millettia, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, clustered flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to nutrient cycling in its ecosystem. Its fruits are legumes that split open to release seeds, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The tree is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in both ecological and possibly medicinal contexts."
