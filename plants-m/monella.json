    "intro": "Monella, commonly known as the \"false mallow,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are typically herbaceous, with alternate leaves that are often palmately lobed or deeply cut. They produce showy, five-petaled flowers that are usually pink, purple, or white, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Monella species are native to various regions in the Americas and are often found in moist, shaded environments. Some species are cultivated for their ornamental value or used in traditional medicine."
