    "intro": "Mimosa decurrens, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Mimosa decurrens is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and ease of care."
