    "intro": "Mentha longifolia var. phaeocoma, commonly known as sweet cicely, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features slender, erect stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are elongated with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its aromatic leaves and roots have been historically used in culinary and medicinal applications. The variety is distinguished by its pale green stems and slightly different leaf morphology compared to other Mentha species."
