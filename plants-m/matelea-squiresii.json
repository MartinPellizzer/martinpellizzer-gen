    "intro": "Matelea squiresii, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite leaves that are typically oval to lance-shaped. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Matelea squiresii is adapted to withstand drought conditions and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
