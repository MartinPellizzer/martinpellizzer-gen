    "intro": "Mimosa leprosa, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by bean-like seed pods that split open when mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Mimosa leprosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and delicate appearance."
