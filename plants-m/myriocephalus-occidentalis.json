    "intro": "Myriocephalus occidentalis, commonly known as the western star lily, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
