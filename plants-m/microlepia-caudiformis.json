    "intro": "Microlepia caudiformis, commonly known as the horse's tail fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its long, slender fronds that resemble the tail of a horse, hence its common name. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces erect, bipinnate fronds with small, linear pinnae. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Microlepia caudiformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in horticulture for its unique foliage."
