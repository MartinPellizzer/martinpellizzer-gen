    "intro": "Merkusia depauperata, commonly known as the poor man's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, pale green leaves and inconspicuous flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to its ecological niche and its role in the study of orchid evolution."
