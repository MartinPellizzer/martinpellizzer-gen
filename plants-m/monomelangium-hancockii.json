It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its unique floral morphology and growth habits. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are lanceolate and often have a distinct venation pattern, while its flowers are small and clustered in umbels. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
