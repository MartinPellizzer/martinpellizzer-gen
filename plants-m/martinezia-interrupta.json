    "intro": "Martinezia interrupta, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along canyon walls. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. The plant has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand periods of drought."
