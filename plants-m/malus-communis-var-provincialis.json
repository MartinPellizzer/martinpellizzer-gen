    "intro": "Malus communis var. provincialis, commonly known as the provincial apple, is a lesser-known variety of the apple tree. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and moderate size, making it suitable for smaller gardens. The leaves are typically oval with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface. Its flowers are white and appear in clusters, contributing to its ornamental value. The fruit is usually small, tart, and used primarily for culinary purposes rather than commercial apple production."
