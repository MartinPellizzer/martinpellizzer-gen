    "intro": "Mitrophyllum moniliforme, commonly known as the beaded milkweed, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, bead-like structures on its stems, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are typically opposite and lance-shaped. It thrives in dry, open habitats and is often found in grasslands and shrublands. The plant is known for its milky sap, which is a characteristic feature of the Asclepiadaceae family."
