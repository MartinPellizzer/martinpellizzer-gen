    "intro": "Melampyrum versicolor, commonly known as the variable touch-me-not, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Scrophulariaceae. It is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored flowers that range from yellow to orange and red, depending on the variety. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs. Melampyrum versicolor is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it can derive some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants."
