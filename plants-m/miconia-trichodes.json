    "intro": "Miconia trichodes, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers, followed by dark, fleshy berries. Miconia trichodes is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed habitats. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in certain regions."
