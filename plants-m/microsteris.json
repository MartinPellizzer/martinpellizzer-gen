It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the summer months. Microsteris is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and ecological studies."
