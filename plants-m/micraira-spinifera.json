    "intro": "Micraira spinifera, commonly known as the spiny leaf orchid, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in racemose inflorescences, often blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
