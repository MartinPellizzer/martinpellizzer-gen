    "intro": "Melica yajiangensis, commonly known as Yajiang needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of China. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
