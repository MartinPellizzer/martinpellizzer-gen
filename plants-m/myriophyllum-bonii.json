    "intro": "Myriophyllum bonii, commonly known as the African watermilfoil, is a semi-aquatic plant native to Africa. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving rivers. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often submerged, with small, opposite leaves that are oval to lance-shaped. It produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late summer. Myriophyllum bonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in aquatic ecosystems."
