    "intro": "Malachra berteroi, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and drought conditions. Malachra berteroi plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
