It features tiny, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically in shades of pink or white. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and slopes. This variety is notable for its compact growth habit and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
