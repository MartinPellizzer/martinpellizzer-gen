    "intro": "Myriophyllum salsugineum, commonly known as water lentil or American watermilfoil, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is an aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often submerged, with small, opposite leaves that are usually less than 1 cm in length. It produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Myriophyllum salsugineum is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats, which can impact water quality and aquatic ecosystems."
