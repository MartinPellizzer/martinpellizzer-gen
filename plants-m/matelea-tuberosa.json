    "intro": "Matelea tuberosa, commonly known as the Mexican nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, which bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its tuberous roots are an important part of its structure, storing nutrients and water. Matelea tuberosa is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in arid environments."
