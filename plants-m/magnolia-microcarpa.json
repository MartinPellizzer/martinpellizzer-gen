    "intro": "Magnolia microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf magnolia, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and elliptical, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in late winter or early spring, typically in shades of white or pale pink. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Magnolia microcarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
