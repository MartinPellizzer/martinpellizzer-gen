    "intro": "Melica ciliata subsp. monticola, commonly known as the alpine brome, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in high-altitude meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive ciliate margin. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in alpine environments."
