    "intro": "Marcgravia lineolata, commonly known as the lineolate split-leaf vine, is a climbing plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, deeply lobed leaves that often display a contrasting coloration on their upper and lower surfaces. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that are typically borne in clusters along the stems. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening, though it requires careful handling due to its climbing nature."
