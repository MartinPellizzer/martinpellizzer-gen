    "intro": "Myrsine myrtillina, commonly known as the small myrsine, is a flowering plant belonging to the Primulaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its small, glossy leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows as an understory species in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains several seeds, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and small mammals. The species is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
