    "intro": "Melhania vohipalensis, commonly known as the Madagascar star apple, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its showy, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pink. The plant produces a fleshy, edible fruit that is similar in appearance to a star fruit, though it is less commonly cultivated. It thrives in tropical climates and requires well-drained soil and ample sunlight. Melhania vohipalensis is valued for both its ornamental beauty and its potential as a fruit-bearing plant in its native habitat."
