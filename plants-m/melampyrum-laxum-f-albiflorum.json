    "intro": "Melampyrum laxum f. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered yellow vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients. The plant is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies."
