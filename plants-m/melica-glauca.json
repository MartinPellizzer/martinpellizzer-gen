    "intro": "Melica glauca, commonly known as bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green leaves and spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and stream banks. Melica glauca has a fibrous root system and produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wildlife."
