    "intro": "Miconia orcheotoma, commonly known as the orchid miconia, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, showy bracts that resemble orchid flowers, though it is not a true orchid. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with opposite, ovate leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and are accompanied by brightly colored, leaf-like bracts that serve to attract pollinators."
