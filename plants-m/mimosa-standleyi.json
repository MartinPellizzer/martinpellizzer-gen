    "intro": "Mimosa standleyi, commonly known as the yellow mimosa, is a shrub native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are sensitive to touch, closing when disturbed. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening due to its aesthetic appeal and unique leaf response."
