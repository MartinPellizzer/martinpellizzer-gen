    "intro": "Moricandia arvensis var. macrosperma, commonly known as the large-seeded field moricandia, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important crops such as cabbage and mustard. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with slender stems and alternate, pinnately divided leaves. Its small, yellow flowers are arranged in racemes and bloom in the summer months. The seeds are large and encased in a smooth, dark brown capsule, which aids in its dispersal by wind."
