It features short, cylindrical stems that are typically green to blue-green in color, covered with white, woolly spines. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun. Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
