It features small, fern-like leaves that are typically clustered at the base of the plant. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by long, slender seed pods. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for ecological studies and wetland restoration projects."
