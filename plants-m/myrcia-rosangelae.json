    "intro": "Myrcia rosangelae, commonly known as the Rosangelia myrtle, is a shrub native to the Atlantic rainforests of Brazil. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes other aromatic plants like eucalyptus and clove. The plant is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its fruits are small, woody capsules that contain seeds, and the plant is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
