    "intro": "Mapania micrococca, commonly known as the red-flowered mapania, is a small evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its clusters of small, bright red flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are elliptical, glossy, and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant blooms. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking ornamental foliage and flowers. The plant is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
