    "intro": "Mentha pulegium, commonly known as pennyroyal, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically oval or lance-shaped. The plant produces tiny, pale blue or white flowers in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Pennyroyal is known for its strong, mint-like aroma, which comes from the essential oils present in its leaves. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a natural pesticide due to its chemical properties."
