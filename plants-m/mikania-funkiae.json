It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant produces small, showy flowers with five petals, typically in shades of blue or purple, which bloom throughout the warmer months. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a velvety texture, while its stems are trailing and can root at the nodes. Mikania funkiae is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as stream banks and forest edges."
