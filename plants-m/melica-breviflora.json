    "intro": "Melica breviflora, commonly known as the short-flowered brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and woodland edges. The plant has slender, tufted culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its small, spike-like inflorescence consists of numerous short, spikelets that are often pale green to brown in color. Melica breviflora plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
