    "intro": "Meliosma lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf meliosma, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, alternate leaves that are often gland-dotted and have a distinctive, slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by elliptical, winged fruits that disperse via wind. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Meliosma lanceolata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ecological importance to native pollinators."
