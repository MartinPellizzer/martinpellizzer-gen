    "intro": "Melocactus rotifer, commonly known as the \"red-tailed melon cactus,\" is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its columnar stem and distinctive, red or orange spines that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant's slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
