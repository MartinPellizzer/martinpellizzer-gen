    "intro": "Myriopteris intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate harts-tongue fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features a short, thick rhizome with lance-shaped, dark green fronds that are deeply divided into pinnate lobes. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, which are released during the spring and summer months. The plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
