    "intro": "Muhlenbergia curtisetosa, commonly known as the narrowleaf muhlenbergia, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, linear leaves that are often covered in a silvery-blue bloom. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed florets, typical of many grasses. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is also used in erosion control and as a wildlife habitat plant."
