    "intro": "Myrceugenia longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved myrtle, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the temperate rainforests of southern South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its humid, cool habitat. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in terminal or axillary inflorescences. Its fruits are small, woody capsules that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Myrceugenia longifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities."
