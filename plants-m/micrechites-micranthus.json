    "intro": "Micrechites micranthus, commonly known as the small-flowered rock cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and arid environments. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops and weeds. The plant has small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters near the base of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. Micrechites micranthus is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can thrive in harsh, sunny conditions."
