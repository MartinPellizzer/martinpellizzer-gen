    "intro": "Masdevallia zongoensis, commonly known as the Zongo orchid, is a species of orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Peru. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often brightly colored flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions with partial shade. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself in the rocky substrates it prefers. The flowers often have intricate patterns and are highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts for their beauty and rarity."
