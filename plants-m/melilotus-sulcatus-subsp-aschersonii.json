    "intro": "Melilotus sulcatus subsp. aschersonii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved melilot, is a flowering plant native to central and eastern Europe. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils, and is often found in disturbed areas. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
