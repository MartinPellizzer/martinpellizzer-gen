    "intro": "Mammillaria gebweileriana, commonly known as the Gebweiler's nipple cactus, is a small, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that help protect it from intense sunlight and moisture loss. The plant produces pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is typically found growing in rocky, well-drained soils in arid environments. Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for succulent collections."
