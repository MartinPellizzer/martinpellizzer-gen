    "intro": "Mimosa velloziana var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold together when touched, a response triggered by the plant's sensitivity to touch. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its ornamental value and unique characteristics, it is often grown in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
