    "intro": "Mimosa townsendii, commonly known as Townsend's mimosa, is a deciduous shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features delicate, fern-like compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by the plant's sensitive thigmonastic movement. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers in early spring, which are followed by long, slender pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its unique leaf behavior and ornamental value make it a notable species in arid landscapes."
