    "intro": "Mespilus persoonii, commonly known as the Persian white mulberry, is a deciduous tree native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and simple, alternate leaves that are oval-shaped with a pointed tip. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by round, fuzzy fruits that turn red when mature. The fruit is edible, though often used in jams and preserves, and the tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in traditional medicine."
