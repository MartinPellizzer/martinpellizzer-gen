    "intro": "Monopsis arenaria, commonly known as sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, which helps reduce water loss. Monopsis arenaria is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a characteristic species of desert scrub habitats."
