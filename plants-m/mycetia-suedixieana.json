    "intro": "Mycetia suedixieana, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive reddish heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic qualities. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, with compound leaves and showy, pale yellow flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural distribution. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered in many regions."
