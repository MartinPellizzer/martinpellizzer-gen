It belongs to the family Restionaceae, which includes many species adapted to arid and coastal environments. The plant is characterized by its narrow, upright stems and small, clustered leaves. Its flowers are typically tiny and borne in dense inflorescences, often appearing in late summer or early autumn. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
