    "intro": "Meridiana pygmaea, commonly known as the miniature jade plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, rounded, fleshy leaves that are typically a deep green color, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is a succulent, capable of storing water in its leaves, making it drought-tolerant. Due to its slow growth and attractive appearance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and rockeries."
