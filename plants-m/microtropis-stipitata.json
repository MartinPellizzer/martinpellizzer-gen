    "intro": "Microtropis stipitata, commonly known as the hairy microtropis, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Microtropis stipitata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
