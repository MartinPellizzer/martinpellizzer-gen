    "intro": "Machaerium condensatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf machaerium, is a tropical perennial grass native to Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland or riparian habitats, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, while its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small white or pale yellow flowers. Machaerium condensatum is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
