    "intro": "Micromeria subcordata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved micromeria, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the tribe Cardueae within the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and feathery foliage. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as rocky slopes and open woodlands. Its leaves are narrow and often have a glandular surface, which may contribute to its ability to retain moisture. The flowers are small, yellowish, and arranged in a flat, disk-like head, typical of many members of the Asteraceae family."
