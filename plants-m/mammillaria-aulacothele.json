    "intro": "Mammillaria aulacothele, commonly known as the white-tipped hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a dense covering of white, woolly bristles that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are borne on short, erect stems. Its stems are typically ribbed and covered with small, spiny tubercles. This species is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
