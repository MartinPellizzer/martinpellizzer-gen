    "intro": "Masdevallia venatoria, commonly known as the hunting masdevallia, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its unique, often strikingly colored flowers that resemble insects or other small creatures, a trait that aids in its pollination by attracting specific insect pollinators. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its foliage consists of long, narrow leaves that are adapted to capture moisture from the humid air. Masdevallia venatoria is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its intricate floral structure and unusual appearance."
