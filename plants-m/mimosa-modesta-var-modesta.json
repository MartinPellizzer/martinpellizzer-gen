It is characterized by its biennial growth habit, with the first year producing only leaves and the second year blooming and setting seed. The plant features bipinnately compound leaves that are soft and fuzzy to the touch, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in spherical inflorescences, which attract various pollinators. The species is often found in disturbed soils and can become invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
