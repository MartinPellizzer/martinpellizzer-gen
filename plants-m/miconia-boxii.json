    "intro": "Miconia boxii, commonly known as the Hawaiian miconia, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, showy bracts that resemble petals. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, and has opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves. It produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by distinctive red, fleshy fruits. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a significant ecological threat in its native habitat."
