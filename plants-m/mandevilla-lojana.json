    "intro": "Mandevilla lojana, commonly known as the Lojana mandevilla, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Ecuador. It is a vigorous climber with thick, waxy stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink, red, and white. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant. Mandevilla lojana is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and hummingbirds."
