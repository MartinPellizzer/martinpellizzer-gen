    "intro": "Misopates orontium var. pusillus, commonly known as the dwarf water crowfoot, is a small aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. The plant has finely divided, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits that contain buoyant seeds. This variety is a hardy, low-maintenance plant often used in water gardens and wetland restoration projects."
