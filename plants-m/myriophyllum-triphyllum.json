    "intro": "Myriophyllum triphyllum, commonly known as water milfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to North America. It has slender, branching stems that are often mistaken for waterweed due to its similar appearance. The plant produces small, green flowers that emerge from the water surface, typically in late summer. Its leaves are opposite, with three leaflets, giving it a distinctive trifoliate appearance. Myriophyllum triphyllum plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life."
