    "intro": "Malaxis cordilabia, commonly known as the heart-leaf orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a single, showy flower that typically blooms in the spring. The plant produces a slender, wiry stem that bears a single, erect flower with a distinctive, spurred lip. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and endangered species in its native range."
