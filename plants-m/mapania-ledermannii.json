It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants commonly known as buckwheats. The plant is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology, featuring broad, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or reddish in color, adapting to its native habitat's environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
