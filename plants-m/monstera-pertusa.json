It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that develop distinctive holes and splits as they mature. The plant has a climbing habit and can grow up to 30 feet in height under ideal conditions. Its stems are sturdy and can be trained to climb trellises or other structures. Monstera pertusa thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil."
