    "intro": "Malus leucophaea, commonly known as the whiteleaf apple or whiteleaf crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically white to pale green on the underside, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by edible, sour apples that mature in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Malus leucophaea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
