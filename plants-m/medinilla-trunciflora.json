    "intro": "Medinilla trunciflora, commonly known as the velvet tangerine or velvet flower, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and striking, velvety purple bracts that surround its small, white flowers. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and unique floral display. Medinilla trunciflora is also valued for its ability to produce edible fruits, which are small and resemble tangerines in appearance."
