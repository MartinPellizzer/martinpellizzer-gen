    "intro": "Mentha arvensis var. diffusa, commonly known as field mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, slightly serrated leaves and clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as meadows and woodland edges. It has a creeping growth habit with rhizomatous roots that allow it to spread readily. The essential oils extracted from its leaves and stems are used in aromatherapy and traditional medicine for their calming and digestive properties."
