    "intro": "Myrtus aotearoana, commonly known as the Kauri myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its aromatic, dark green leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, round, blue-black berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland forest areas. Myrtus aotearoana is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in M\u0101ori culture."
