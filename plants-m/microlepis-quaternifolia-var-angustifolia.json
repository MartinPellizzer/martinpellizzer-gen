    "intro": "Microlepis quaternifolia var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf microlepis, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, angular stems and small, opposite leaves. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade. The leaves are lanceolate, with a narrow, pointed shape, and are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, and are usually pale green or yellowish in color. This variety is notable for its delicate appearance and its role in supporting local insect populations."
