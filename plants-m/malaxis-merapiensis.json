    "intro": "Malaxis merapiensis, commonly known as the Merapi orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, greenish or yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
