It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and riverbanks. The plant features slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of small, two-lobed spikelets. This variety is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining soil stability in its native range."
