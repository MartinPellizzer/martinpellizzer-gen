    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 rotundifolia var. trevirani, commonly known as Welsh mint, is a hybrid mint species characterized by its rounded, slightly toothed leaves. It is native to the British Isles and thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant produces small, pale purple or white flowers in whorled clusters, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its aromatic foliage contains essential oils that contribute to its minty scent and medicinal properties. This variety is often used in herbal teas and as a culinary herb due to its refreshing flavor."
