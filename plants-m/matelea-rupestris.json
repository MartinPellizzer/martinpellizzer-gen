    "intro": "Matelea rupestris, commonly known as the rock matelea, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, spineless stems and dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and rocky environments. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
