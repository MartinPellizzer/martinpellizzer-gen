    "intro": "Magnolia calimaensis, commonly known as the Calima magnolia, is a rare and endemic species native to the rainforests of Colombia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter, typically displaying white or pale pink hues. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical fruits that contain numerous winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Its leaves are broad and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), providing a distinctive texture. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
