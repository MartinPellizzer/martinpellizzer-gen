    "intro": "Microstegium vimineum subsp. nodosum, commonly known as nodose wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets and small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a noxious weed in some regions."
