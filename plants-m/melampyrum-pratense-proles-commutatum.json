    "intro": "Melampyrum pratense proles commutatum, commonly known as the common yellow toadflax, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on its host plants for water and nutrients while still performing photosynthesis. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodlands. Its flowers are yellow and resemble those of the common toadflax, with two lips and five stamens. The species is often found in Europe and parts of Asia, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
