    "intro": "Micrampelis, commonly known as the climbing orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their vine-like growth habit, with stems that coil around supports as they climb. They typically have small, delicate flowers that are often brightly colored, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are usually alternate and may be lance-shaped or ovate, depending on the species. Micrampelis species are found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded, humid environments."
