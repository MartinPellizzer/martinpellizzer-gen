    "intro": "Medicago rigidula f. viscidula, commonly known as the viscid milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, viscid stems and trifoliate leaves with stipules. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that mature to a dry, leathery texture. This species is adapted to drought conditions and is often found in disturbed soils and rocky habitats."
