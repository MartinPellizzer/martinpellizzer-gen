    "intro": "Marsdenia stellaris, commonly known as the star-shaped Marsdenia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with five petals and a prominent corona. Its fruits are follicles that release seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal. Marsdenia stellaris is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in shaded, moist environments."
