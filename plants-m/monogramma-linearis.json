It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically linear in shape. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening due to its elegant appearance."
