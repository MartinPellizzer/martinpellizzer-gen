    "intro": "Masdevallia ustulata, commonly known as the scorched masdevallia, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its unique, often colorful flowers with intricate patterns and a distinctive, elongated shape. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial orchid, thriving in shaded, humid environments with well-drained soil. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense rosette near the base. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate species that is highly sensitive to environmental changes."
