    "intro": "Marshallfieldia, commonly known as the marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas in Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, often pale pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and thrives in environments with ample sunlight. Marshallfieldia has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy inflorescences that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important component of wetland ecosystems."
