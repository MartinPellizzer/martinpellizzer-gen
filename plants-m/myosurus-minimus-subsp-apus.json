    "intro": "Myosurus minimus subsp. apus, commonly known as the lesser wall rue, is a small, herbaceous fern native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. The plant has a creeping rhizome with dense, clustered fronds that are pinnately divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This subspecies is notable for its delicate appearance and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
