    "intro": "Matayba longipes subsp. tepuiensis, commonly known as the tepui matayba, is a shrub native to the tepuis of northern South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its simple, lanceolate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in the humid, nutrient-poor soils of montane ecosystems. Due to its restricted distribution and unique adaptations, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
