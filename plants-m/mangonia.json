    "intro": "Mangonia, commonly known as the mangosteen, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and broad, glossy leaves. The plant produces striking purple flowers that give way to the famous purple-hued fruit, known for its sweet and tangy flavor. Mangonia thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil and requires partial shade for optimal growth. Its fruit is not only delicious but also valued for its medicinal properties."
