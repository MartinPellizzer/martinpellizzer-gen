    "intro": "Melaleuca bisulcata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf paperbark, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, papery bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in dense clusters, which are typically followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its leaves are narrow and slightly curved, with a leathery texture and a prominent midrib. Melaleuca bisulcata is often found in coastal and heathland environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun."
