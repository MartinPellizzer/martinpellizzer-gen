    "intro": "Micromeria teneriffae var. ramosa, commonly known as the Canary Island germander, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers and dense, branched growth habit. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in the dry, coastal environments of its native habitat. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is distinguished by its more branched structure compared to the typical form of Micromeria teneriffae."
