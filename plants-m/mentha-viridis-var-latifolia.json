    "intro": "Mentha viridis var. latifolia, commonly known as broad-leaf spearmint, is a variant of the spearmint plant characterized by its wider leaves compared to the typical spearmint. It is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers and has a strong, aromatic scent due to its high concentration of essential oils. Its leaves are used in culinary applications and herbal remedies, and it is also popular in aromatherapy. The variety is valued for its adaptability and ability to thrive in a range of soil conditions."
