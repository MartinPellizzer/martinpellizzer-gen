It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, thriving in sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Milla maritima is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate salt spray."
