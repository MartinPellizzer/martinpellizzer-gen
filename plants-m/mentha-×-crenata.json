    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 crenata, commonly known as catnip, is a hybrid plant in the mint family (Lamiaceae) characterized by its square, erect stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. It produces small, pale purple or white flowers that are clustered in whorls along the stem. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been naturalized in many regions around the world. It is known for its strong aromatic properties, which are attributed to the presence of nepetalactone and other essential oils. Mentha \u00d7 crenata is often cultivated for ornamental purposes and has a long history of use in traditional medicine and as a stimulant for cats."
