    "intro": "[WRONG START] Marialeva uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower marsh plant, is a herbaceous species native to wetland environments in South America. It features a slender, upright stem that grows up to 30 centimeters in height. The plant produces a single, showy yellow flower at the top of the stem, which blooms during the summer months. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of hairs. Marialva uniflora thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshy areas along riverbanks."
