    "intro": "Memorialis concinna var. velutina, commonly known as the velvetleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are soft and velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces striking trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, typically blooming in the early morning. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
