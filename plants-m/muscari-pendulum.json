It produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that hang downward, giving it its common name. The flowers are typically blue to violet in color, and the plant blooms in early spring. Muscari pendulum thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate."
