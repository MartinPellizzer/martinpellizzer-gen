    "intro": "Mespilus punctata, commonly known as the spotted medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, rough, spiny bark and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces edible fruits that are typically harvested in the fall, though they are often inedible until they undergo a process called \"bleeding,\" where they soften and release a sweet, aromatic pulp. Mespilus punctata is also notable for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its historical use in traditional medicine. Its ornamental value is further enhanced by its seasonal changes in foliage and fruiting habits."
