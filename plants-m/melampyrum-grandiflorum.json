It is characterized by its dense, hairy stems and clusters of small, reddish or pinkish flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, with a distinctive reddish hue when mature."
