    "intro": "Marina crenulata var. stipulacea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sea holly, is a coastal plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its narrow, serrated leaves and striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize dune ecosystems."
