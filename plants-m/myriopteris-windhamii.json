    "intro": "Myriopteris windhamii, commonly known as Windham's holly fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, fern-like fronds with a distinctive, glossy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky outcrops and forest floors. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
