    "intro": "Microcerasus incana var. araxina, commonly known as the Armenian cherry, is a deciduous shrub native to the Caucasus region. It features small, elliptical leaves with a silvery underside, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of white to pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
