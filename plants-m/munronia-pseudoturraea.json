    "intro": "Munronia pseudoturraea, commonly known as the Florida munronia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pink in color. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain one or two seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands and along streams. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
