    "intro": "Muscari olivetorum, commonly known as the olive musk grape. It is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region, characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that turn from green to black as they mature. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge in early spring. Muscari olivetorum is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a border plant due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
