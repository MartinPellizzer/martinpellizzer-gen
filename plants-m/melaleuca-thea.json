    "intro": "Melaleuca thea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled pattern of white and grey beneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in winter, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a glossy upper surface and a pale underside. Melaleuca thea is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden environments."
