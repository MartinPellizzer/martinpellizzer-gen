It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are often submerged, with tiny white flowers that emerge above the water surface. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and preference for sunny to partially shaded conditions. Micranthemum standleyi is often used in aquariums due to its ornamental value and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
