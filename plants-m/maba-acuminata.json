    "intro": "Maba acuminata, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood that is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant has simple, opposite, and often leathery leaves, and its flowers are small and yellowish-green, typically clustered in terminal panicles. It produces small, woody capsules that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to overharvesting, Maba acuminata is considered an endangered species in many parts of its native range."
