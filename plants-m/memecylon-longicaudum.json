It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often elliptic leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in primary forests. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitats."
