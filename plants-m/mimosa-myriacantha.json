    "intro": "Mimosa myriacantha, commonly known as the many-lobed mimosa, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It features compound leaves that are pinnately divided into numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late summer. It is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. The species is also noted for its sensitivity to touch, causing the leaflets to fold when disturbed."
