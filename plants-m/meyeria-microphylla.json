    "intro": "Meyeria microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily grows on the branches of coniferous trees. It is native to regions of North America, particularly in the western United States and parts of Canada. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or pink berries that are toxic to animals. It plays a significant role in forest ecosystems by influencing tree growth and biodiversity. Its unique life cycle involves a complex relationship with its host trees, making it an important subject in ecological studies."
