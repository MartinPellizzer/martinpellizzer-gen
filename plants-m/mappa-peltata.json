    "intro": "Mappa peltata, commonly known as the broadleaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which are typically 4-8 inches in diameter and have a smooth, glossy surface. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that resemble tiny helicopters. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in supporting local wildlife."
