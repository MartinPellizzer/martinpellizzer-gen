    "intro": "Melampyrum lineare f. stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved yellow rattle, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while still performing photosynthesis. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, giving it the specific epithet \"stenophyllum.\" It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and heaths, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
