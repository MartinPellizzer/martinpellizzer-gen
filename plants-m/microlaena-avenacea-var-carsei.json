    "intro": "Microlaena avenacea var. carsei, commonly known as the coastal microlaena, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, pale green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt-laden coastal environments. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its erosion control capabilities and ability to stabilize dunes."
