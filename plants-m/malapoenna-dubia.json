    "intro": "Malapoenna dubia, commonly known as the rare ghost orchid, is a unique epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and striking, elongated flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on the trunks of trees in the undergrowth of rainforests. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a subtle, sweet fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its restricted habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, Malapoenna dubia is considered a critically endangered species."
