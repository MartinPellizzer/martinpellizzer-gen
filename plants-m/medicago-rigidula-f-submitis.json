    "intro": "Medicago rigidula f. submitis, commonly known as the dwarf clover, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for ornamental and ecological landscaping."
