    "intro": "Microstegium clavigerum, commonly known as the slender wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow flowers in the spring. Its fruits are dry, dehiscent capsules that release tiny seeds when mature. Microstegium clavigerum is often found in disturbed soils and can be an indicator of acidic, nutrient-rich habitats."
