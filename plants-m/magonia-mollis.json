    "intro": "Magonia mollis, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Magonia mollis is often found in disturbed habitats and can be invasive in certain regions."
