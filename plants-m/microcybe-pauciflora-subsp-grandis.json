    "intro": "Microcybe pauciflora subsp. grandis, commonly known as the large-flowered microcybe, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves and clustered, small inflorescences. The plant produces pale to brownish flowers, typically arranged in dense spikes, which are often subtended by bracts. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands, preferring well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare species with conservation concerns."
