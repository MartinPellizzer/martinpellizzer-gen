    "intro": "Melocactus harlowii subsp. borhidii, commonly known as the Borhidii melocactus, is a small, columnar cactus native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem with a distinctive, conical crown that is often covered in a dense layer of white, waxy bloom. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically short-lived but highly attractive to pollinators. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments. The subspecies is noted for its compact size and unique appearance, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
