    "intro": "Micromeria glabella, commonly known as the smooth micromeria, is a small, annual herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the citrus family, Rutaceae, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, oval fruits containing aromatic seeds. Its leaves are typically smooth and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Micromeria glabella is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions."
