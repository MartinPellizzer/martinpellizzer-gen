    "intro": "Microtatorchis paife, commonly known as the Peacock Orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, colorful petals that resemble the plumage of a peacock. The plant has small, clustered roots that help it anchor in rocky soil and absorb nutrients from the thin, nutrient-poor environment. Its flowers bloom during the early spring, adding a vibrant touch to its alpine habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
