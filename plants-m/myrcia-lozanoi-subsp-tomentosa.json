    "intro": "Myrcia lozanoi subsp. tomentosa, commonly known as the tomentose myrcia, is a shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, glandular, and tomentose (fuzzy) foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pink, followed by elliptical, woody fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
