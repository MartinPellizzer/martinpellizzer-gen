It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens in warm climates. Due to its unique appearance and adaptive features, it is often cultivated for both its aesthetic value and ecological benefits."
