    "intro": "Malus orientalis subsp. montana, commonly known as the mountain crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 2\u20136 meters and is characterized by its oval-shaped, glossy dark green leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers in the spring, followed by edible, tart red or yellow fruits. It is well adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a hardy species suitable for alpine gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its compact growth habit and showy blossoms."
