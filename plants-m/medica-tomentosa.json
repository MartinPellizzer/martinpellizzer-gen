    "intro": "Medica tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly medick, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, soft, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Medica tomentosa is valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
