    "intro": "Mulinum hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy mullein, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features tall, erect stems covered in soft, velvety hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Mulinum hirsutum is often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky soils."
