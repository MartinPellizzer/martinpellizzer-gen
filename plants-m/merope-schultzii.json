    "intro": "Merope schultzii, commonly known as the Schultze's merope, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and features dense, leathery foliage that helps it conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually elliptical or ovate, with a waxy coating that reduces water loss. Merope schultzii is well adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy plant for xeriscaping."
