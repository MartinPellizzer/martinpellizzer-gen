    "intro": "Melissa arvensis, commonly known as field mint, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its square stems, opposite leaves, and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in whorls. The plant produces a strong, mint-like aroma due to the presence of essential oils in its leaves and stems. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas. Melissa arvensis is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
