    "intro": "Montiopsis, commonly known as the \"rock rose\" or \"mountain star,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae. These plants are typically small, herbaceous perennials that thrive in arid and rocky environments. They are characterized by their delicate, often fragrant flowers that come in shades of white, pink, and purple. Montiopsis species are native to regions of southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. Their succulent leaves and compact growth habit make them well adapted to harsh, dry climates."
