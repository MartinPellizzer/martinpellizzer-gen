    "intro": "Micromyrtus arenicola, commonly known as the sand dune myrtle, is a small shrub native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for native fauna. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
