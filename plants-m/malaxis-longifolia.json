    "intro": "Malaxis longifolia, commonly known as the long-flowered malaxis, is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a raceme, with long, slender sepals and petals. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Due to its unique floral structure and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and orchid enthusiasts."
