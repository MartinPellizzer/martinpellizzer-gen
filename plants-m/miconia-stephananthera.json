It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with bright purple bracts that enclose small, white flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
