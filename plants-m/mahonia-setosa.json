    "intro": "Mahonia setosa, commonly known as the creeping mahonia, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its evergreen holly-like leaves that are glossy and dark green with spiny margins. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by blue-black berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Mahonia setosa is also valued for its hardiness and ability to tolerate a range of environmental conditions."
