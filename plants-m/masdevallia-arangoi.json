    "intro": "Masdevallia arangoi, commonly known as the Arango's masdevallia, is a rare and exquisite orchid native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is characterized by its intricate, often brightly colored flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its foliage consists of narrow, strap-like leaves that are adapted to absorb moisture from the humid air. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a challenging species for cultivation."
