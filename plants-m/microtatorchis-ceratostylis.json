    "intro": "Microtatorchis ceratostylis, commonly known as the horned-styled microtatorchis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, commonly known as the orchid family, and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it can receive filtered sunlight. Its unique floral structure includes a prominent, horn-like staminode that distinguishes it from other orchid species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
