    "intro": "Mabea montana subsp. lucida, commonly known as the shining mabea, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a glossy surface and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters. Its flowering period occurs in the spring, and it is often found in association with other woodland flora. The subspecies is distinguished by its more elongated leaves and slightly different floral structure compared to other Mabea species."
