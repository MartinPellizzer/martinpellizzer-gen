    "intro": "Malpighia nummulariifolia subsp. clarensis, commonly known as the Clarense wax apple, is a small shrub native to the Caribbean islands. It is characterized by its glossy, oval-shaped leaves and small, red, fleshy fruits that resemble miniature apples. The plant produces flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is edible, though often consumed in jams or as a medicinal tonic in traditional practices. The species is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates."
