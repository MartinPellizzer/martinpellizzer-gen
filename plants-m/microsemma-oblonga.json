It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes plants such as philodendrons and peace lilies. The plant is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. Its flowers are small and clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, which is enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe. Microsemma oblonga is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks."
