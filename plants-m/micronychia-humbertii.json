    "intro": "Micronychia humbertii, commonly known as the Humberth's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leaf-like structures that resemble true leaves. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis through its scale-like leaves. It is native to certain regions of Africa and is often found in humid, forested environments. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
