    "intro": "Micranthes lumpuensis, commonly known as the Lumpy Mountain toothcup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, tooth-like leaves and clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils at high elevations. It is often found in open, sunny habitats such as slopes and cliffs. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
