    "intro": "Mimosa claussenii var. microphyllidia, commonly known as the small-leaved sensitive plant, is a species native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its rapid growth and unique foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
