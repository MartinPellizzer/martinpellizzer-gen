    "intro": "Merremia verruculosa, commonly known as the roughleaf morning glory, is a flowering vine native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
