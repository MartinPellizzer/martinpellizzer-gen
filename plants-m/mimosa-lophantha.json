    "intro": "Mimosa lophantha, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer seasons. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and unique leaf movement make it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
