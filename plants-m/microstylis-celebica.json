    "intro": "Microstylis celebica, commonly known as the Celebes microstylis, is a flowering plant native to the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, spikelet-based flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it blend into its natural habitat. Microstylis celebica is often found in moist, open areas such as grasslands and forest edges."
