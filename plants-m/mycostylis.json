    "intro": "Mycostylis, commonly known as the false lichen, is a genus of lichens that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae. These organisms are composite life forms consisting of a fungal partner and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. Mycostylis species are often found growing on rock surfaces, soil, or tree bark in various habitats. They are characterized by their crust-like thallus and often display a range of colors, from yellow to brown. These lichens play an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and serve as indicators of environmental conditions."
