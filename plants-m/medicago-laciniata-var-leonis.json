It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically deeply lobed and have a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by small, round pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration and landscaping."
