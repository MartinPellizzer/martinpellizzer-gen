    "intro": "Misodendrum antarcticum, commonly known as the Antarctic mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Southern Hemisphere. It primarily grows on the branches of southern beech trees, forming dense clusters that can cover large portions of the host. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its berries are red and contain toxic compounds, which deter herbivores. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
