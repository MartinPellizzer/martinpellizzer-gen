    "intro": "Morithamnus crassus, commonly known as the broadleaf cryptantha, is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and floral structure. It is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant features prominently veined, broad leaves that are often hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Its flowers are typically small, clustered in racemes, and range in color from white to pale purple. The seed pods are indehiscent, containing several angular seeds that are dispersed by wind or animals."
