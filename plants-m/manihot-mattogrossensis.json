    "intro": "Manihot mattogrossensis, commonly known as the Amazonian cassava, is a perennial shrub native to the Amazon Basin. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its woody stem and alternate, simple leaves. The plant produces small, green flowers that are often clustered in umbels. Its roots are edible and have been traditionally used as a food source by indigenous communities. However, it is less commonly cultivated compared to other cassava species due to its lower yield and specific environmental requirements."
