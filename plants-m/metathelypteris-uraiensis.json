    "intro": "Metathelypteris uraiensis, commonly known as the Urai cliff fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and cliff faces, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are short and thick, anchoring it to the substrate while supporting its vascular system. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a single row along the margins of the fronds, a feature common in many ferns of its family."
