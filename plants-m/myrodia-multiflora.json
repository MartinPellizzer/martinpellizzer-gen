    "intro": "Myrodia multiflora, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing structure and produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has silver-gray foliage with dense, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Myrodia multiflora is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
