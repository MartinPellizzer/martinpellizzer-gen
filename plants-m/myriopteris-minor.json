    "intro": "Myriopteris minor, commonly known as the small fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are typical of the Polypodiaceae family. Myriopteris minor thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky outcrops. Its rhizome is wiry and often forms dense colonies, contributing to its ability to colonize various habitats."
