It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and showy, clustered flowers with five petals. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. The fruit is a capsule that disperses its seeds through wind or animals, contributing to its ecological role in the region."
