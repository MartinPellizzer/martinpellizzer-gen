    "intro": "Muraltia pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved muraltia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that help it retain moisture in its often arid habitat. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in clusters. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, known for its nitrogen-fixing abilities. Muraltia pachyphylla is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and resilience."
