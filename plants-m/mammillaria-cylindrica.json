    "intro": "Mammillaria cylindrica, commonly known as the cylindrical hedgehog cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a smooth, greenish-gray body and prominent radial spines. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10-15 centimeters and features a ribbed structure that helps it store water. It produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, red fruits. This species is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
