    "intro": "Moquinia polymorpha var. elaeagnifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf moquinia, is a variant of the moquinia plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage, which results from dense, overlapping scales on the leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, with a leathery texture that aids in water retention. The species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in fluctuating water conditions."
