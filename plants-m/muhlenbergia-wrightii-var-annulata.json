    "intro": "Muhlenbergia wrightii var. annulata, commonly known as the woolly muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy, silver-green foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces fluffy, pinkish to reddish seed heads in late summer, which are visually striking and attract wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
