    "intro": "Miconia camporum, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or red miconia, is a tropical tree native to South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. Miconia camporum is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage and floral display. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
