    "intro": "Monoon polycarpum, commonly known as the white mangosteen, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are elliptical and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by round, segmented fruits. The fruit's outer layer, or pericarp, is typically thick and leathery, while the inner segments contain the edible, juicy pulp. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of medicinal compounds."
