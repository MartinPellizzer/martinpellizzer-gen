    "intro": "Myriocarpa densiflora var. dombeyana, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight."
