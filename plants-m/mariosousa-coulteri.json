    "intro": "Mariosousa coulteri, commonly known as Coulter's mariosousa, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, showing adaptations to drought and heat. Its leaves are usually narrow and grayish-green, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. The showy yellow flowers bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
