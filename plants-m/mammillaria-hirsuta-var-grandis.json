It is characterized by its dense, white woolly covering that covers the stems and spines, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright sunlight, making it a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in arid environments."
