    "intro": "Mecosorus marginellus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Mecosorus marginellus plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
