It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is often found in rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
