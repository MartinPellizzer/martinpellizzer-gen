    "intro": "Mentha acutata, commonly known as sharp mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorls along the stems, typical of the Lamiaceae family. Mentha acutata has a strong, sharp mint aroma due to its high concentration of volatile oils, particularly menthone and pulegone. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks."
