    "intro": "Millea ecuadorensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian millea, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and palmate leaves. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in humid, forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
