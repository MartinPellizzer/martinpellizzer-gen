    "intro": "Mentha longifolia subsp. undulata, commonly known as creeping mint, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, slightly minty scent and its prostrate growth habit, with stems that often root at the nodes. The leaves are oval to ovate, with a serrated margin and a hairy surface, and they emit a strong fragrance when crushed. It produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue to purple in color, appearing in late summer. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its ability to spread and cover ground effectively."
