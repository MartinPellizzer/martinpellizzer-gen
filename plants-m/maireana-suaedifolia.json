    "intro": "Maireana suaedifolia, commonly known as coastal maireana, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It has small, narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it suitable for coastal landscapes. Its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize sand dunes make it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
