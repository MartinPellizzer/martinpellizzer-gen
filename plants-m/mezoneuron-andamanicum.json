    "intro": "Mezoneuron andamanicum, commonly known as the Andaman mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the Andaman Islands. It is a terrestrial orchid with a compact growth habit, featuring a pseudobulb and a single, showy flower. The plant has a fibrous root system and thrives in humid, shaded environments within tropical rainforests. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with intricate patterns, and it blooms during the monsoon season. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and is of significant botanical interest for its unique morphology and restricted distribution."
