    "intro": "Macaranga reineckei, commonly known as the white-veined macaranga, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a fast-growing shrub or small tree that typically reaches heights of up to 5 meters. The leaves are large, ovate, and have prominent white veins, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The plant is notable for its ability to form mutualistic relationships with ants, which protect it from herbivores in exchange for shelter and food."
