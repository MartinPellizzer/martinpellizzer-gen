    "intro": "Microlicia ericoides, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It features dense, leathery foliage with small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a fine, white wax. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple, blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal and maritime climates. Microlicia ericoides is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardiness in coastal gardens."
