    "intro": "Macodes sanderiana, commonly known as the Sander's mignonette, is a rare and highly sought-after orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with short, branching stems and clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil to flourish. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate appearance and unique fragrance, making it a prized specimen among orchid enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is also considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
