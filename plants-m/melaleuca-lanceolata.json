    "intro": "Melaleuca lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia, where it typically grows in coastal heathlands and open forests. The plant is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that gives it a distinctive appearance, and its narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers in spikes, which are often followed by woody capsules containing the seeds. Melaleuca lanceolata is adapted to coastal conditions and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness."
