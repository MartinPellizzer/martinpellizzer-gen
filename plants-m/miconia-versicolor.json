    "intro": "Miconia versicolor, commonly known as the variable miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that are often pubescent and have a distinctive veinal pattern. The plant produces showy, pink or red bracteate inflorescences that are highly attractive to pollinators. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
