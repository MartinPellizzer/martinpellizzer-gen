    "intro": "Micropholis gardneriana var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved evergreen shrub, is a species native to the humid forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are often white or pale pink, which bloom in clusters during the wet season. Its woody structure and dense foliage make it well adapted to shaded understory environments. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates."
