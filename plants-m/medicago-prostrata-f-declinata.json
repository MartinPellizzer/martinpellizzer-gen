    "intro": "Medicago prostrata f. declinata, commonly known as the prostrate medick, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces yellow flowers in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with stems lying close to the ground. This form is a natural variant of the species, exhibiting distinct morphological traits that set it apart from the typical upright form."
