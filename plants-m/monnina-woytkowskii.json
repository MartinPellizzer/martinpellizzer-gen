    "intro": "Monnina woytkowskii, commonly known as the yellow mallow, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia and parts of the Middle East. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and palmate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is typically found in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in warmer regions."
