It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes other aromatic plants such as eucalyptus and clove. The plant is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruits are woody capsules containing numerous seeds, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. The aromatic oils found in its leaves and flowers contribute to its use in perfumery and as a natural insect repellent."
