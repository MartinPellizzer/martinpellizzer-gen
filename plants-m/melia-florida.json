    "intro": "Melia florida, commonly known as the chinaberry tree, is a deciduous tree native to Asia but widely cultivated in the southern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by orange to yellow, fleshy fruits that contain toxic seeds. Its botanical features make it a notable species in both ornamental horticulture and ecological studies. The plant is also known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
