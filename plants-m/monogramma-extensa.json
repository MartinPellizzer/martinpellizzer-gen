    "intro": "Monogramma extensa, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that form dense, low-growing mats. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark brown, wiry rhizomes that help it colonize rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are pinnately divided with a distinctive, almost lacy appearance, and they are covered in fine, silky hairs. Monogramma extensa is well adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in limestone or sandy habitats."
