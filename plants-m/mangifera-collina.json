    "intro": "Mangifera collina, commonly known as the hill mango, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that develop into edible, sweet fruits. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its fruit is often smaller and less sweet compared to the common mango, but it is valued for its unique flavor and nutritional content. Mangifera collina plays an important role in both ecological and agricultural systems in its native habitat."
