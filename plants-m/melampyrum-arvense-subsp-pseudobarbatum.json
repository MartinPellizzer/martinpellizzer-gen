    "intro": "Melampyrum arvense subsp. pseudobarbatum, commonly known as the false goatweed, is a flowering plant in the family Orobanchaceae. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is found in meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges across Europe and parts of Asia. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with two lips, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. It plays a role in local ecosystems by supporting insect pollinators and serving as a food source for certain herbivores."
