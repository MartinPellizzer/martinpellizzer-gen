    "intro": "Mimulus tigrinus, commonly known as the tiger's mouth or the weeping jewelflower, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking orange to red flowers with dark veins, which resemble a tiger's mouth, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and produces showy, pendulous blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Mimulus tigrinus is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant color and ornamental value."
