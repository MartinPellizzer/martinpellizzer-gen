    "intro": "Myrtus nivellei subsp. tibesticus, commonly known as the Tibesti myrtle, is a shrub native to the hyperarid regions of the Tibesti Mountains in Chad. It is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and produces white flowers that bloom in the rainy season. The plant has adapted to extreme desert conditions with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains seeds, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
