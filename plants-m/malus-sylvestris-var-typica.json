It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters, featuring a rounded canopy and distinctive red or brown bark. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in spring, which are followed by edible, sour apples in the fall. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, contributing to its ornamental value. This variety is often used in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
