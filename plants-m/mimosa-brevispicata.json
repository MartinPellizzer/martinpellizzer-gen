    "intro": "Mimosa brevispicata, commonly known as the short-spined mimosa, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by flattened pods containing several seeds. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and open woodlands."
