    "intro": "Mikania mollis, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are often overlooked due to their inconspicuous appearance. Mikania mollis is a vigorous vine that can grow rapidly, making it an invasive species in many regions. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a challenge for agricultural management."
