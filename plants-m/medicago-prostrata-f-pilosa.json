    "intro": "Medicago prostrata f. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy prostrate medic, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant characterized by its dense, hairy foliage. It features small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. The plant has trifoliate leaves with pubescent surfaces, and its stems are often prostrate, lying close to the ground. It is typically found in disturbed soils and sunny habitats, such as roadsides and fields. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in soil stabilization."
