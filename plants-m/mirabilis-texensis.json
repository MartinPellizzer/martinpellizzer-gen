    "intro": "Mirabilis texensis, commonly known as the Texas four o'clock, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that open in the late afternoon and close at dawn, a trait known as nyctinasty. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and produces clusters of four-petaled blooms in shades of red, pink, and white. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for drought-tolerant gardens. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
