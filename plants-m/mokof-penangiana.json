    "intro": "Mokof penangiana, commonly known as the Penang mokof, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its leaves are elliptical, glossy, and often have a slight waxy coating. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Mokof penangiana is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
