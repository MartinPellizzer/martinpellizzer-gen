    "intro": "Meriania nana, commonly known as the dwarf meriania, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, glossy leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Meriania nana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in warm, tropical gardens."
