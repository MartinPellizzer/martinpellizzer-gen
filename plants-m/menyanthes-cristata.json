    "intro": "Menyanthes cristata, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine and arctic regions. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has alternate, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Menyanthes cristata plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environments and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
