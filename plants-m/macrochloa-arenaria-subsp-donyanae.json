    "intro": "Macrochloa arenaria subsp. donyanae, commonly known as the Donyi grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered with a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute flowers, which are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in steppe and desert ecosystems. Due to its hardy nature, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats."
