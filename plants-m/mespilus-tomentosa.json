    "intro": "Mespilus tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly mulberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish bark and heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white\u7ed2\u6bdb. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, black berries that ripen in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows. The woolly mulberry is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
