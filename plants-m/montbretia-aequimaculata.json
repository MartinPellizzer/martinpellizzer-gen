    "intro": "Montbretia aequimaculata, commonly known as the orange lily, is a striking perennial plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its vivid orange-red flowers with a distinctive black spot at the base of each petal. The plant features strap-like, grassy leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped blooms during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is further enhanced by its ability to naturalize and spread readily in suitable climates."
