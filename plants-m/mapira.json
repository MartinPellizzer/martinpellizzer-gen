    "intro": "Mapira, commonly known as the African violet, is a popular ornamental plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its velvety, heart-shaped leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Mapira is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to bloom year-round under proper care. Its compact size and vibrant colors make it a favorite among indoor gardeners."
