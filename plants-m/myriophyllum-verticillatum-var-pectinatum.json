    "intro": "Myriophyllum verticillatum var. pectinatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features whorled leaves that are narrow and ribbon-like, typically ranging from 2 to 8 cm in length. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which emerge from the water surface in late summer. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense underwater stands. Its rapid growth can lead to dense vegetation, impacting water quality and aquatic habitats."
