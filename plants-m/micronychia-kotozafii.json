    "intro": "Micronychia kotozafii, commonly known as the Kotozafii moonflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, emitting a sweet, intoxicating scent. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are dark green and velvety to the touch. Its flowers are typically short-lived, blooming only for a few hours before closing at dawn. Micronychia kotozafii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique nocturnal blooming habit."
