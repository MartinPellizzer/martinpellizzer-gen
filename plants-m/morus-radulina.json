    "intro": "Morus radulina, commonly known as the silky mulberry, is a species of mulberry native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a soft texture. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that turn from green to red as they mature. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded environments. The leaves are not only ornamental but also used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
