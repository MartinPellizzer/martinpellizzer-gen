    "intro": "Monoporus paludosus var. parvifolius, commonly known as the small-leaved swamp fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to wetland environments in Southeast Asia. It thrives in shallow, muddy waters and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface that helps it retain moisture in its wetland habitat. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered at the base of the leaves, aiding in spore dispersal. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
