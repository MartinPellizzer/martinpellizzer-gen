    "intro": "Melochia benthamii, commonly known as the velvetleaf or red velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that are followed by distinctive, fleshy, red or purple berries. It is native to regions of South America and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil types, it can become an invasive species in some areas."
