    "intro": "Metrodorea concinna, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the western Pacific, including parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, elongated pods containing dark, glossy seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal or lowland forest areas. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional crafts, it is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic and cultural significance."
