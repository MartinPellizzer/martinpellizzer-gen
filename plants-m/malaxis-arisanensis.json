    "intro": "Malaxis arisanensis, commonly known as the Arisan Malaxis, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in a spike, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
