    "intro": "Myagrum sphaerocarpum, commonly known as the spherical mangrove, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to coastal regions of northern Australia and is adapted to brackish water environments. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are white and clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, round fruits that are dispersed by water. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for marine and terrestrial organisms."
