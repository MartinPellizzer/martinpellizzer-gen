    "intro": "Miconia parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. Miconia parvifolia is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in regions outside its native range."
