    "intro": "Mimosa rostrata, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Mimosa rostrata is often cultivated as a ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and rapid growth habit."
