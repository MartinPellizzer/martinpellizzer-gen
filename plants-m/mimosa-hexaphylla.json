    "intro": "Mimosa hexaphylla, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by touch-induced changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warm seasons. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. Mimosa hexaphylla is often found in disturbed areas and is adaptable to various environmental conditions."
