    "intro": "Melinis longiseta subsp. longiseta, commonly known as the long-haired grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and long, silky hairs that cover its leaves and inflorescence. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are typically green to brown in color. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its fibrous root system makes it a persistent weed in agricultural and natural settings."
