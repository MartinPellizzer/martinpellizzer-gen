    "intro": "Mitracarpus neglectus, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that typically reaches a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant features lance-shaped, hairy leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Mitracarpus neglectus is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability."
