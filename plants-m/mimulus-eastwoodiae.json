It belongs to the family Phrymaceae and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats such as stream banks and meadows. It has heart-shaped leaves and produces seed capsules that release tiny seeds when mature. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
