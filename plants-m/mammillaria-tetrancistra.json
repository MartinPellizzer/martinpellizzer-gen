    "intro": "Mammillaria tetrancistra, commonly known as the four-armed hedgehog cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular stem with short, cylindrical ribs and is covered in white to pale green areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for collectors and cactus enthusiasts."
