    "intro": "Mentzelia torreyi var. torreyi, commonly known as the Torrey's blazingstar, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. The species is part of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is known for its ecological importance to native pollinators."
