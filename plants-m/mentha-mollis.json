    "intro": "Mentha mollis, commonly known as velvet menthol, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves that give it a velvety texture, and its square, hairy stems. The plant produces small, pale purple or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Mentha mollis is often used in herbal medicine for its mild menthol-like scent and potential soothing properties. It prefers moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight."
