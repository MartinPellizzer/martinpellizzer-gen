    "intro": "Miconia brachybotrya, commonly known as the small-fruited miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces showy, clustered inflorescences with white to pink flowers that attract various pollinators. Its fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that splits open to release seeds. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
