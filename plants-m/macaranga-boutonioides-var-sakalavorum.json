It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its rapid growth rate and ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments make it a common sight in lowland rainforests. The leaves are used in traditional practices and are also valued for their lightweight and durable fibers."
