It is characterized by its small, yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale yellow ray florets. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, exhibiting adaptations to saline and windy environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This variety is often used in traditional medicine for its mild sedative and anti-inflammatory properties."
