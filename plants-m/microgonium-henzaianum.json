    "intro": "Microgonium henzaianum, commonly known as the golden mist fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its intricate, fern-like fronds that are covered in a fine, golden-hued bloom, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and high air humidity to flourish. Its unique botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes."
