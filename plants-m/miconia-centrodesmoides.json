    "intro": "Miconia centrodesmoides, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or *Miconia* tree, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a large shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its broad, palmate leaves and showy, white to pinkish inflorescences. The plant produces small, red fruits that are edible for some bird species but toxic to humans and livestock. It is also notable for its rapid growth rate and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in certain areas."
