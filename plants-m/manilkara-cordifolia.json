    "intro": "Manilkara cordifolia, commonly known as the Indian shea tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia and parts of Africa. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and produces a fruit with a thick, oily pulp. The tree's bark and seeds are used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The fruit's pulp is a source of shea butter, which is widely used in cosmetics and food products. It thrives in humid climates and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks."
