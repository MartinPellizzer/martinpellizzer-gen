    "intro": "Medicago arenicola, commonly known as the sand vetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions. It is a low-growing annual or perennial herb that thrives in sandy and rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated seed pods. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with three small, oval-shaped leaflets. Medicago arenicola plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitats."
