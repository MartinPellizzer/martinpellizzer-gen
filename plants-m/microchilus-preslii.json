    "intro": "Microchilus preslii, commonly known as the Preslii's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tiny, clustered inflorescences. It thrives in cool, humid environments with high altitude and partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
