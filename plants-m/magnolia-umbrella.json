    "intro": "Magnolia umbrella, commonly known as *Magnolia tripetala*, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, showy white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The tree has a broad, umbrella-like canopy, giving it its common name, and its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a serrated edge. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in bottomlands and along stream banks."
