    "intro": "Melaleuca pityoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled pattern of white, pink, and green beneath. The plant produces small, bottle-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, which appear in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a waxy surface, and it is drought-tolerant, making it adaptable to a range of environmental conditions. Melaleuca pityoides is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in coastal and sandy soils."
