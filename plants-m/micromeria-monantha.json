    "intro": "Micromeria monantha, commonly known as the single-flowered micromeria, is a small, annual herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its flowers are pale yellow to greenish-white, and it produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
