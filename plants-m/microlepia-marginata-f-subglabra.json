    "intro": "Microlepia marginata f. subglabra, commonly known as the smooth-leafed sword fern, is a variant of the sword fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that are typically longer than wide, with a smooth, glossy surface on the leaf blades. The fronds are usually dark green and have a delicate, feathery appearance, with pinnae that are narrowly lanceolate. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in humid, tropical gardens."
