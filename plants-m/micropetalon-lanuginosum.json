    "intro": "Micropetalon lanuginosum, commonly known as the woolly petalwort, is a small, perennial liverwort that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It features a rosette of fleshy, woolly leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is typically found in rocky or sandy soils, often near streams or in forest understories. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
