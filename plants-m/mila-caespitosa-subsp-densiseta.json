    "intro": "Mila caespitosa subsp. densiseta, commonly known as the dense-hairy mila, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky slopes. The plant is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. Its small, clustered flowers are usually white or pale yellow, appearing in late spring to early summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its dense covering of hairs, which gives it its common name and helps in identifying it among other mila species."
