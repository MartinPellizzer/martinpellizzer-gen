It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by fleshy, orange-red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories.
