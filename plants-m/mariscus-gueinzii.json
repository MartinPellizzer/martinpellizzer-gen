    "intro": "Mariscus gueinzii, commonly known as the Gueinzii mallow, is a flowering plant native to specific regions in South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
