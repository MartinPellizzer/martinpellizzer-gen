It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with numerous stolons that root at the nodes. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its drought-resistant traits and efficient water-use strategies."
