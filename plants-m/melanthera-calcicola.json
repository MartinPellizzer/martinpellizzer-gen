    "intro": "Melanthera calcicola, commonly known as the limestone bladderwort, is a small, herbaceous plant native to calcareous soils in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, alkaline environments. Its leaves often have a bladders-like structure, which may aid in water retention. Melanthera calcicola is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats, where it thrives in the presence of calcium-rich substrates."
