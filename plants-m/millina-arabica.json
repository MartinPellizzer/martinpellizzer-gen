    "intro": "Millina arabica, commonly known as the Arabica coffee plant, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the highlands of Ethiopia and Sudan. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant's fruit, known as a cherry, turns red when ripe and contains two seeds, which are the beans used for coffee. Millina arabica thrives in tropical climates with high altitudes, moderate temperatures, and consistent rainfall. It is highly sensitive to pests and diseases, requiring careful cultivation for optimal yields."
