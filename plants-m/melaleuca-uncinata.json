    "intro": "Melaleuca uncinata, commonly known as the broad-leaved paperbark, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, flaky bark that peels away in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, and it thrives in well-drained soils in coastal and sandy regions. Melaleuca uncinata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardiness."
