    "intro": "Mallotus spinulosus, commonly known as the spiny mallot, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, spiny capsules that contain the seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded environments. The spiny structures on its fruit and stems are adaptations that aid in seed dispersal and protection from herbivores."
