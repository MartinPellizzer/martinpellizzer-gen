    "intro": "Mariscus sanguineofuscus, commonly known as the blood-red marsh plant, is a perennial herbaceous species native to wetland habitats in eastern North America. It features slender, erect stems that often root at the nodes, and its leaves are lanceolate with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink to reddish in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, acidic soils. Mariscus sanguineofuscus is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds."
