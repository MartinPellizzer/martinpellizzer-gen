    "intro": "Mizonia centralis, commonly known as the central starflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of central Europe. It features delicate, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring, typically in shades of white and yellow. The plant has slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of soft hairs. Mizonia centralis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a pollinator attractant and its use in traditional herbal medicine."
