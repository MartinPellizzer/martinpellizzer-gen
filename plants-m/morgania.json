    "intro": "Morgania, commonly known as the mountain bluet, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae. These plants are native to the mountainous regions of western North America, particularly in the United States and Canada. They are characterized by their blue or violet flowers, which bloom in the summer months. Morgania species typically have hairy stems and leaves, and they often grow in rocky or dry habitats. The genus includes several species, such as Morgania globulifera and Morgania parviflora, which are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance."
