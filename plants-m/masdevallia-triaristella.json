It is characterized by its small, intricate flowers with three prominent lobes, often in shades of white and green. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to its epiphytic lifestyle. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
