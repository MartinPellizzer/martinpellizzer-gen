    "intro": "Medicago nigra, commonly known as black medic, is an annual legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, dark purple to black flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, elliptical pods containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Black medic is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. It is a common weed in agricultural settings but also serves as a forage plant for livestock."
