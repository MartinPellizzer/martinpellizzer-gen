It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
