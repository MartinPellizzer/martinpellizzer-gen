    "intro": "Manihot pilosa, commonly known as the hairy arrowleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Its botanical features make it adaptable to various soil types and climatic conditions, though it prefers well-drained soils. The hairy arrowleaf is also valued for its potential in agroforestry and as a source of medicinal compounds."
