It is characterized by its large, fragrant, white flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant has smooth, gray bark and elliptical leaves that turn yellow in autumn. Its flowers are used in traditional Chinese medicine for their purported therapeutic properties. The subspecies is distinguished by its shorter, more compact growth habit compared to the typical Magnolia officinalis."
