    "intro": "Mimusops amazonica, commonly known as the Amazonian satinwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and large, glossy leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing a single seed. Its ornamental value and durable wood make it economically important in its native region. However, it is also considered vulnerable due to habitat loss and overharvesting."
