    "intro": "Merremia tridentata subsp. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features heart-shaped leaves with three distinct lobes and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of purple or pink. The plant has a strong, woody vine structure and can grow quite long, often reaching several meters in length. Its flowers open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name. The subspecies is characterized by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Merremia tridentata."
