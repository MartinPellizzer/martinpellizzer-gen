    "intro": "Moly, commonly known as yellow ironweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, spiky flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Moly is often found in moist to wet soils in prairies and along stream banks. Its botanical name, *Veronicastrum utile*, reflects its historical use in traditional medicine."
