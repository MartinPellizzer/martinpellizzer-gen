    "intro": "Mentha sylvestris var. microphylla, commonly known as catnip, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, pale blue or purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves contain high concentrations of essential oils, particularly nepetalactone, which is responsible for its distinctive scent and effects on cats. This variety is often cultivated for its medicinal and aromatic properties."
