    "intro": "Mormodes auriculata, commonly known as the golden ear cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are ribbed and often covered in small spines. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, adding a striking visual element to its appearance. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it thrives in well-drained soil with plenty of sunlight. It is a popular choice for desert gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
