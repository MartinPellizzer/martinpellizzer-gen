    "intro": "Montia exigua, commonly known as the dwarf watercress, is a small, herbaceous annual plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. The plant features slender, succulent stems and small, alternate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Its flowers are tiny, white or pale green, and appear in clusters at the ends of the stems. Montia exigua is valued for its peppery taste and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
