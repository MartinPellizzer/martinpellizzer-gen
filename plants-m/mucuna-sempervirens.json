    "intro": "Mucuna sempervirens, commonly known as the evergreen cowpea, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces elongated, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen make it valuable for soil enrichment. Mucuna sempervirens is also noted for its use in agroforestry and as a forage crop."
