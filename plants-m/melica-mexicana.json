    "intro": "Melica mexicana, commonly known as Mexican needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowering period occurs in the spring and early summer, and it is adapted to thrive in arid environments. Botanically, it is characterized by its fine, wiry stems and is often found in association with other desert vegetation."
