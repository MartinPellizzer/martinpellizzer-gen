    "intro": "Mammillaria cirrhifera var. angulosior, commonly known as the angular mammillaria, is a compact, globular cactus with a distinctive angular appearance. It features white to pale green tubercles that are often covered with a layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring or early summer, which are typically borne on short, hairy pedicels. Native to Mexico, it thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water to prevent root rot. Due to its unique shape and relatively easy care, it is a popular choice for collectors and succulent enthusiasts."
