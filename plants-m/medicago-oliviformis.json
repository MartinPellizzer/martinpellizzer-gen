    "intro": "Medicago oliviformis, commonly known as the olive medick, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically oval to elliptic in shape, and its small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, roadsides, and disturbed areas. Medicago oliviformis is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and forage production."
