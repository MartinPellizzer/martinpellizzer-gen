    "intro": "Miconia centronioides, commonly known as the giant miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, it can become invasive in certain regions."
