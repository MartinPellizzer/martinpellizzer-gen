    "intro": "Millotia myosotidifolia var. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple. The leaves are typically lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, though the variety 'glabrescens' is distinguished by its smooth, hairless surface. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable plant for rock gardens or containers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
