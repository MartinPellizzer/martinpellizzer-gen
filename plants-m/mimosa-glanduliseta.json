    "intro": "Mimosa glanduliseta, commonly known as the sticky mimosa, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are composed of numerous small leaflets arranged in a feathery pattern. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems and leaves are covered in fine, glandular hairs that secrete a sticky substance, giving the plant its common name. This feature also helps to deter herbivores and retain moisture in arid environments."
