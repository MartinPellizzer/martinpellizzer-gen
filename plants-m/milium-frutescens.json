    "intro": "Milium frutescens, commonly known as the red root grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has slender, upright stems and produces small, spike-like clusters of white to pink flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a reddish tint at the base. Milium frutescens is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
