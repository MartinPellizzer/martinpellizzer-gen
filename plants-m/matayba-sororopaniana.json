    "intro": "Matayba sororopaniana, commonly known as the black rosewood, is a species of flowering plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its dark, dense wood and aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which attract various pollinators. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and are often used in traditional medicine. Due to its valuable timber, Matayba sororopaniana is also threatened by deforestation and habitat loss."
