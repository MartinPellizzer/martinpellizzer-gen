    "intro": "Miconia riparia, commonly known as the river miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Neotropical region. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter, often with a glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It is often found in moist, shaded areas near rivers and streams in tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming an invasive species."
