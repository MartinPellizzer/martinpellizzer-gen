    "intro": "Magnolia echinina, commonly known as the spiky magnolia, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny seed pods that encase its seeds, setting it apart from other magnolia species. The plant produces large, showy white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a smooth texture and a dark green color. Magnolia echinina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
