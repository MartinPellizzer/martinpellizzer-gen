    "intro": "Mendoncia retusa, commonly known as the smooth mendoncia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features a slender, upright stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
