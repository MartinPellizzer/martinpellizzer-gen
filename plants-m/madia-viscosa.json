    "intro": "Madia viscosa, commonly known as sticky madia, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that produce a sticky resin, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in clusters and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The resinous properties of Madia viscosa have historically been used by indigenous peoples for various purposes, including as a natural adhesive."
