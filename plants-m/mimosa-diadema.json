    "intro": "Mimosa diadema, commonly known as the golden mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in response to touch, a trait known as thigmonasty. Its root system has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility. Mimosa diadema is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique flowering behavior."
