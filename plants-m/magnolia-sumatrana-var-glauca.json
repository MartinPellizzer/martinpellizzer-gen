    "intro": "Magnolia sumatrana var. glauca, commonly known as the Sumatran glaucous magnolia, is a variant of the Sumatran magnolia native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy, bluish-gray coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a fragrant scent. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
