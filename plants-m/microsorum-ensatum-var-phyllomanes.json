    "intro": "Microsorum ensatum var. phyllomanes, commonly known as the Japanese water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Microsorum. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of a fern, though it is actually a member of the water fern family, Marsileaceae. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its leaves are usually bright green and can vary in shape depending on light conditions and water quality. This variant is valued in aquatic gardening for its ornamental appeal and ability to help maintain water clarity by absorbing nutrients."
