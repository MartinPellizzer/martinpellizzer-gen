    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 verticillata f. parvula, commonly known as narrow-leaf water mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in moist environments such as stream banks, wet meadows, and marshy areas, often forming dense colonies. The plant produces small, pale blue to violet flowers arranged in whorls along the stem, typical of the mint family. Its leaves are aromatic and contain essential oils, contributing to its medicinal and culinary uses. This variety is distinguished by its smaller leaf size compared to other Mentha species, making it easily identifiable in its natural habitat."
