    "intro": "Medicago breviflora, commonly known as the short-flowered clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, trifoliate leaves and produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas. It is an important forage plant for livestock and also serves as a host for certain legume pests. Medicago breviflora is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to soil fertility."
