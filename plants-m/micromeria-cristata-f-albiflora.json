It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments, often found in coastal regions of southern California. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, with a distinct, spicy scent. This variety is distinguished by its pale, almost white floral display, setting it apart from the more typical yellow flowers of the species."
