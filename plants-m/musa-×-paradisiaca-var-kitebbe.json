    "intro": "Musa \u00d7 paradisiaca var. kitebbe, commonly known as the Kitebbe banana, is a variety of the common banana plant native to West Africa. It is characterized by its large, elongated, and often curved fruit, which can weigh up to 20 kilograms. The plant produces clusters of elongated, yellow to orange fruits that are typically harvested when they are still green but have reached full size. The leaves are broad and blade-like, with a prominent midrib and a waxy surface. This variety is valued for its high yield and is often used in both local consumption and commercial trade."
