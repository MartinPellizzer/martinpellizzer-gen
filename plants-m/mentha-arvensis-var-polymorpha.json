    "intro": "Mentha arvensis var. polymorpha, commonly known as field mint, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its square stems, opposite leaves, and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in whorls. The plant has a strong mint aroma due to its high concentration of essential oils, primarily menthol and menthone. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Field mint is widely used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb."
