    "intro": "Metagonia, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple ray florets and a central disk of yellow flowers, which resemble a composite flower head. The plant is native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern Mediterranean, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. Metagonia has narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. It is often used in ornamental gardening for its unique appearance and hardy nature."
