    "intro": "Mirabilis pudica var. pubescens, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. It thrives in warm, humid climates and prefers well-drained soil. Its unique response to touch makes it a popular choice for educational and ornamental purposes."
