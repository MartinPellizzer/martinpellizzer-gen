    "intro": "Mikania maxonii, commonly known as the Mexican morning glory, is a climbing vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its rapid growth and heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple, blooming in the morning. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
