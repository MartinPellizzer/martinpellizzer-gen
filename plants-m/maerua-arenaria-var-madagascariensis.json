    "intro": "Maerua arenaria var. madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascar sandmat, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Madagascar. It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low water availability. Its branching structure and compact growth form make it well-suited for rocky or coastal environments. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber in local communities."
