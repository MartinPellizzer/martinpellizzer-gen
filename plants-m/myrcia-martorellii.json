    "intro": "Myrcia martorellii, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a shrub or small tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various birds and mammals. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
