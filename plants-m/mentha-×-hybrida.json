    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 hybrida, commonly known as peppermint, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Mentha spicata (spearmint) and Mentha viridis (watermint). It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its square, erect stems and opposite, serrated leaves. The plant produces small, pale purple flowers that emerge in whorls along the stems. Peppermint is known for its strong, aromatic scent and high concentration of menthol, which contributes to its medicinal and commercial uses. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is widely cultivated for essential oils, teas, and culinary applications."
