    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum ciliolatum, commonly known as the woolly bush, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, hairy leaves that help it store water and reduce transpiration in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it an attractive and low-maintenance plant for arid landscapes."
