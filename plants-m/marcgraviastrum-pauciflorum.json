    "intro": "Marcgraviastrum pauciflorum, commonly known as the rare Amazonian tree, is a member of the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters. It thrives in the humid, shaded understory of tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
