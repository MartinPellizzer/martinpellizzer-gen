    "intro": "Moraea viscosa, commonly known as the sticky moraea, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces striking, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant has hairy, often sticky leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers are typically borne on tall, slender stems and are pollinated by birds and insects. Moraea viscosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
