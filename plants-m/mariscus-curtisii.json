    "intro": "Mariscus curtisii, commonly known as the Curtis's mariscus, is a rare and endangered flowering plant native to the southern United States. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and gourds, and is characterized by its unique, sprawling growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by pale green, edible fruits. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine, white pubescence, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
