    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 maximilianea f. duffortii, commonly known as Duffort's mint, is a hybrid perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, pale blue to violet flowers in whorled clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, giving it a strong menthol scent and making it useful in herbal teas and aromatherapy. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in cooler climates."
