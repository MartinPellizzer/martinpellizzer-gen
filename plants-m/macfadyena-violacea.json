    "intro": "Macfadyena violacea, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, the Americas, and Southeast Asia. It is a climbing vine that produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white. The plant is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The flowers are typically pollinated by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure."
