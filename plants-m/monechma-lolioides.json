The plant has slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs. Its flowers are usually pale blue or purple and appear in clusters, contributing to its ornamental value. Monechma lolioides is adapted to arid conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
