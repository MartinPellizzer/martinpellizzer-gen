    "intro": "Myrsine katrikouensis, commonly known as the Katrikouen myrsine, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to the island of Katrikou, located in the Indian Ocean, and is adapted to the tropical and subtropical climates of its region. The plant typically grows as a shrub, featuring small, elliptical leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, clustered in small umbels, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are a source of food for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
