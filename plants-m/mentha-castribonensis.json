    "intro": "Mentha castribonensis, commonly known as narrow-leaf mint, is a species of flowering plant in the mint family, Lamiaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Afghanistan and Pakistan. The plant is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves and small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in the summer. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates. While not as widely used as other mints, it is valued for its fragrance and has been used in traditional medicine."
