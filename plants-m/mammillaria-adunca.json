    "intro": "Mammillaria adunca, commonly known as the Mexican Hedgehog Cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a dense covering of white, woolly spines that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10-15 centimeters and features a ribbed stem with areoles that bear both spines and flowers. It produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are often followed by small, red fruits. Mammillaria adunca is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil to thrive."
