    "intro": "Mimosa rudis, commonly known as the sea mimosas, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. It has a shallow root system that helps stabilize sand dunes, making it ecologically significant in coastal ecosystems. Mimosa rudis is also known for its sensitivity to touch, as its leaves fold shut when disturbed."
