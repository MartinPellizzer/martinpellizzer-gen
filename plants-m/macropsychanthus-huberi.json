    "intro": "Macropsychanthus huberi, commonly known as the desert star cactus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its short, thick stems and clusters of vibrant yellow flowers. The plant has a compact growth habit, typically reaching heights of less than 10 inches, and features spiny areoles that support its protective spines. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its succulent stems, adapting to its harsh desert environment. The flowers bloom in late spring or early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
