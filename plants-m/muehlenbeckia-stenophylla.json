    "intro": "Muehlenbeckia stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved muhly, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slight waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Muehlenbeckia stenophylla is adapted to grow in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal regions."
