    "intro": "Micromelum, commonly known as the satinwood or white sand apple, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rutaceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Australia, and the Pacific Islands. The plants are typically small to medium-sized trees or shrubs, characterized by their aromatic leaves and showy, white or yellow flowers. The fruits are small, often round, and contain a single seed enclosed in a fibrous pulp. Micromelum species are valued for their ornamental appeal and have been used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber."
