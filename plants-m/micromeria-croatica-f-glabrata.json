    "intro": "Micromeria croatica f. glabrata, commonly known as the Croatian micromeria, is a rare plant species belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its small, glabrous (hairless) leaves and delicate, white or pale yellow flowers. Native to the Balkan Peninsula, this subspecies thrives in rocky and calcareous soils. Its compact growth habit and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in its native range."
