    "intro": "Mimosa somnians var. glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky mimosa, is a variant of the mimosa plant characterized by its glandular structures on the stems and leaves. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant features bipinnately compound leaves that are often covered in fine, sticky hairs, which give it its common name. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in spherical heads, typical of the Mimosa genus. The glandular features of this variant are thought to play a role in defense against herbivores and moisture retention."
