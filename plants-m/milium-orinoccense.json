    "intro": "Milium orinoccense, commonly known as the Orinoco millet, is a small annual grass native to South America. It produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
