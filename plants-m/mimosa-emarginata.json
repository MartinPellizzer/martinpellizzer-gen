    "intro": "Mimosa emarginata, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by touch-induced changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Mimosa emarginata is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and ease of care."
