    "intro": "Myriophyllum axilliflorum, commonly known as the broad-leaved watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in eastern North America. It features long, branching stems with opposite, broad, oval leaves that are often slightly serrated. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers that emerge from the water surface in late summer. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. However, it can also become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
