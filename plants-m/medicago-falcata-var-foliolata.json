It features trifoliate leaves with narrow, lance-shaped leaflets and produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or white. The plant is characterized by its robust root system, which helps in nitrogen fixation, making it valuable for soil enrichment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, meadows, and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological restoration and forage production."
