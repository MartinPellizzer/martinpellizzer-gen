    "intro": "Machaeranthera pinosa, commonly known as the narrowleaf tickseed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its narrow, linear leaves and showy yellow-orange flowers make it a distinctive and ornamental species. Machaeranthera pinosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
