    "intro": "Microlicia venusta, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf senna, is a tropical plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated pods containing several seeds. Native to regions of Central and South America, it is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil types, it is considered an invasive species in some areas."
