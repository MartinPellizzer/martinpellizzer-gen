It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside its native habitat."
