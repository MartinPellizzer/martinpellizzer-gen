    "intro": "Morus alba var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf mulberry, is a variety of the white mulberry native to Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically larger than those of the standard Morus alba. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits called mulberries, which are edible and often consumed by both humans and animals. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its foliage, fruit, and ornamental value. This variety is also used in traditional medicine and as a host plant for silkworms."
