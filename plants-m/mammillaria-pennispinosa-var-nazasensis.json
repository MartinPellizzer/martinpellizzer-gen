    "intro": "Mammillaria pennispinosa var. nazasensis, commonly known as the Nazas nipple cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems and small, rounded tubercles that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable addition to cactus collections."
