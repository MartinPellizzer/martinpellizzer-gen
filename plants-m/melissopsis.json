    "intro": "Melissopsis, commonly known as the honeyflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where they thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Melissopsis species are characterized by their showy yellow or orange flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plants have gray-green foliage and produce small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. They are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value."
