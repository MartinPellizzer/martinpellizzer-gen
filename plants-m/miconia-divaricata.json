    "intro": "Miconia divaricata, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, making it an invasive species in some regions. The plant's botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a challenge for land managers."
