    "intro": "Mesosphaerum coriaceum, commonly known as the roughleaf mesosphaerum, is a rare and unique plant species belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a rough, textured surface, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green to yellow in color. It is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in Brazil, and thrives in humid, tropical environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Mesosphaerum coriaceum is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
