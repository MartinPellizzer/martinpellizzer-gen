    "intro": "Mentha lereschii, commonly known as the Siberian mint, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, pale purple flowers in whorled clusters, typical of the Lamiaceae family. It has a strong, aromatic scent due to its high concentration of essential oils. Mentha lereschii is often used in traditional medicine for its purported cooling and antiseptic properties."
