It typically grows in a variety of habitats, including prairies, woodlands, and disturbed soils. The plants are characterized by their tall, upright growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. Mesosetum species often have spikelets that are loosely arranged along the stems. These grasses play an important role in maintaining soil stability and supporting local biodiversity."
