It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and feathery, silver-green plumes that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense clumps make it a popular choice for erosion control and as a decorative plant."
