    "intro": "Middendorfia thymifolia, commonly known as the thyme-leaved middendorfia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has aromatic leaves that resemble those of thyme, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
