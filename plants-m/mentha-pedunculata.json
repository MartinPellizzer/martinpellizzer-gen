    "intro": "Mentha pedunculata, commonly known as the Japanese mint, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers in whorled clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Mentha pedunculata is valued for its aromatic leaves and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported cooling and digestive properties."
