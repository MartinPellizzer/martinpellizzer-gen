    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 comosa, commonly known as woolly mint, is a hybrid plant that results from the cross between Mentha longifolia and Mentha viridis. It is characterized by its hairy, fuzzy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance and aid in water retention. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments and is native to regions of Europe and western Asia. It produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pale blue or purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Mentha \u00d7 comosa is often used in herbal teas and has a mild, minty fragrance."
