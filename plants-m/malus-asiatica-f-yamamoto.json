    "intro": "Malus asiatica f. yamamoto, commonly known as the Yamamoto apple tree, is a botanical variant of the Asian crabapple. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and ornamental value, with showy white flowers in spring. The leaves are typically dark green and glossy, providing aesthetic appeal throughout the growing season. The fruit, while edible, is smaller and tart compared to cultivated apples, making it more suitable for ornamental purposes. It thrives in temperate climates and is often used in horticultural displays due to its visual appeal."
