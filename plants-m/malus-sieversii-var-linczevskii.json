    "intro": "Malus sieversii var. linczevskii, commonly known as the Linczevskii apple, is a rare and ancient subspecies of the apple tree native to the Tien Shan mountain range in Central Asia. It is considered a wild ancestor of many cultivated apple varieties and exhibits a range of fruit sizes, colors, and flavors. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree with deciduous leaves and produces small, often tart fruits. Its botanical significance lies in its genetic diversity and role in the domestication history of apples. This variety is of particular interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its potential for breeding new apple cultivars."
