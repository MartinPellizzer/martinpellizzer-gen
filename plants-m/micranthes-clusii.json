    "intro": "Micranthes clusii, commonly known as the Clusi's frostflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow blossoms that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or shaded habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
