It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, often hairy stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a bluish-green hue, and it often grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
