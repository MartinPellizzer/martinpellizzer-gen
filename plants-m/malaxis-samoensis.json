    "intro": "Malaxis samoensis, commonly known as the Samoan orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the islands of Samoa. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique floral structure and specialized growth habits. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, tropical environments. Its flowers are small and delicate, often displaying a range of colors from white to pale pink, and it produces a distinctive, fragrant scent. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Malaxis samoensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
