    "intro": "Microula pustulosa var. pustulosa, commonly known as the pustular microula, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the cooler months. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its succulent leaves and stems. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
