    "intro": "Mikania micrantha, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a fast-growing vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom throughout the year. This plant is known for its aggressive growth habit and ability to spread rapidly, often becoming invasive in tropical and subtropical regions. Its stems are covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Mikania micrantha is often found in disturbed habitats, such as along roadsides and in degraded forests."
