    "intro": "Magnolia conspicua var. famasiha, commonly known as the Famasiha magnolia, is a rare and striking plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its large, showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has broad, ovate leaves that are dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its floral display. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is considered a valuable species in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
