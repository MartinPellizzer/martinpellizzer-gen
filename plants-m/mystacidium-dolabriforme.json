It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems, and its flowers are typically greenish-white with a distinctive, elongated shape. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds, aiding in its propagation. It plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing food for various wildlife species."
