    "intro": "Mimosa saman, commonly known as the ceiba tree, is a tropical deciduous tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, umbrella-shaped canopy and smooth, pale bark. The tree produces small, fluffy white flowers that appear in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into two sets of small leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. Mimosa saman is also known for its rapid growth and is often used in reforestation efforts due to its ability to thrive in various soil types."
