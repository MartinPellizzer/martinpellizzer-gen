It is characterized by its delicate, elongated flower spikes that bear small, greenish-white flowers with prominent sepals and petals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or other plants in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually elongated and strap-like, adapted for capturing moisture from the air. The species is noted for its relatively simple floral structure compared to other orchids, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
