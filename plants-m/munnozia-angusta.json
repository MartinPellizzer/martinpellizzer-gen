    "intro": "Munnozia angusta, commonly known as narrowleaf muhly, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. It is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy or rocky soils. Munnozia angusta is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
