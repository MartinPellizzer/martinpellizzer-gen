    "intro": "Mussaenda latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf Mussaenda, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, featuring lance-shaped leaves with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. These bracts are often mistaken for true flowers and serve to attract pollinators. Mussaenda latifolia thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight."
