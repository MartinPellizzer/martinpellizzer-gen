    "intro": "Medicago minima subvar. canescens, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces yellow pea-like flowers followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils. Medicago minima subvar. canescens is often used in agricultural settings for soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability."
