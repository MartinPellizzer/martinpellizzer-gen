    "intro": "Menonvillea famatinensis var. sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the Fama\u00f1inensis Globe Cactus, is a rare and unique cactus species native to Argentina. It is characterized by its globular, segmented stem that resembles a ball, with a spiny exterior that provides protection against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and moths. It thrives in arid environments with well-draining soil and requires minimal water to survive. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
