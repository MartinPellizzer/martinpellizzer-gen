    "intro": "Microsorum heterolobum, commonly known as the heterolobum water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense mats that provide habitat for small aquatic organisms. The leaves are usually dark green and have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental appeal in aquatic gardens."
