    "intro": "Morus paniculata, commonly known as the Chinese mulberry or white mulberry, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible for birds but generally not for humans. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often cultivated for its fibrous bark and as a source of food for silkworms. Morus paniculata is also valued for its ornamental beauty and adaptability to different climates."
