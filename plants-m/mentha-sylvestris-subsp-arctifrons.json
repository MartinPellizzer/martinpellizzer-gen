It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. It has a creeping growth habit with rhizomes that allow it to spread and establish colonies. Due to its cold tolerance and medicinal properties, it is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
