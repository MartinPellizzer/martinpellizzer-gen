    "intro": "Melanthesopsis patens var. oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed melanthus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are elongated, narrow, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in steppe and desert environments. Due to its resilience, it is occasionally cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid gardens."
