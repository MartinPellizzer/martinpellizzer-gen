It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along shorelines and dunes. It has a compact growth habit and produces numerous small seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in coastal gardens."
