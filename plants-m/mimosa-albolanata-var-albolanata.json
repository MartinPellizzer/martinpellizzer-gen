    "intro": "Mimosa albolanata var. albolanata, commonly known as the white mimosa, is a deciduous shrub native to South America. It features compound leaves that are sensitive to touch, folding shut when disturbed, a characteristic known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, fluffy yellow flowers in spring, which are followed by seed pods that split open when mature. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for gardens in temperate climates. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate foliage and unique flowering habit."
