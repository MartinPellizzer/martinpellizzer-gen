    "intro": "Morus albida, commonly known as the white mulberry, is a deciduous tree native to Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are typically pale green in color. The tree produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, fuzzy fruits. It is often cultivated for its leaves, which are used in silk production, and for its edible fruits. Morus albida is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
