    "intro": "Microtropis japonica, commonly known as the Japanese microtropis, is a flowering plant native to Japan and parts of Southeast Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Microtropis japonica is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides."
