    "intro": "Minuartia graminifolia var. hungarica, commonly known as the Hungarian rockcress, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its small, upright stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are linear and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is native to Central Europe and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
