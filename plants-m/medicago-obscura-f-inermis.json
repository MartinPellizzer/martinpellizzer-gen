    "intro": "Medicago obscura f. inermis, commonly known as the smooth medick, is a low-growing perennial legume native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture and produces yellow flowers in early summer. The plant is characterized by its reduced leaflets and the absence of stipules, which distinguishes it from other Medicago species. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it ecologically valuable in soil enrichment."
