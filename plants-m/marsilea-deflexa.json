    "intro": "Marsilea deflexa, commonly known as the flexible water clover, is a small aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its floating leaves that are divided into four lobes, resembling a cloverleaf shape. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are usually submerged, followed by the development of tiny, floating fruits. Marsilea deflexa is often used in ornamental water gardens due to its attractive appearance and ease of cultivation."
