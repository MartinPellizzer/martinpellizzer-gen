    "intro": "Myriopteris cucullans, commonly known as the hooded wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, upright fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Myriopteris cucullans is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining forest biodiversity."
