    "intro": "Miscanthus neocoreanus, commonly known as the Korean silver grass, is a tall, ornamental grass native to East Asia. It features slender, silver-green leaves that turn reddish in the fall, creating a striking visual display. The plant produces fluffy, pale pink plumes in late summer, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Its clumping growth habit makes it an excellent choice for borders, rock gardens, and as a background plant in landscapes."
