    "intro": "Maxillaria gracilis var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed maxillaria, is a species of orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and produces fragrant, violet-colored flowers with a distinctive lip. The leaves are elongated and narrow, typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and are covered in a fine, white pubescence. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its unique floral display. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
