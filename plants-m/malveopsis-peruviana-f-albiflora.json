    "intro": "Malveopsis peruviana f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered Peruvian mallow, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the Andean regions of Peru. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, white petals. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions with well-drained soil. Its foliage is palmately lobed, and it produces fluffy, seed-bearing capsules that disperse its seeds via the wind. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is highly valued in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
