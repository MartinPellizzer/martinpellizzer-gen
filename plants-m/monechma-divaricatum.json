    "intro": "Monechma divaricatum, commonly known as the creeping saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a powdery waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short, slender stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Monechma divaricatum is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
