    "intro": "Macrolobium colombianum var. colombianum, commonly known as the Colombian giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the freshwater ecosystems of Colombia. It is characterized by its large, broad, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, providing a unique habitat for aquatic life. The plant produces showy white flowers with a strong, sweet fragrance, which bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its leaves are buoyant and covered in a waxy cuticle that prevents them from sinking, while its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate. This species plays an important role in maintaining water quality and supporting biodiversity in its native wetlands."
