    "intro": "Mimosa hirsuta, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous annual plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimuli. The plant has small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer seasons. Its growth habit is upright, with stems that can reach up to 3 feet in height. Mimosa hirsuta thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and botanical collections."
