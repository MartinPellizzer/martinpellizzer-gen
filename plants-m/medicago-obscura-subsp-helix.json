    "intro": "Medicago obscura subsp. helix, commonly known as the helix medick, is a perennial legume native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment and forage. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology compared to other Medicago species."
