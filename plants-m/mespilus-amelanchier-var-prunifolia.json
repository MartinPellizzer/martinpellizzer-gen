It features rounded, often multi-stemmed growth with smooth, grey-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces clusters of white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, dark red to black berries in late summer. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with serrated edges and a glossy green upper surface. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its spring blossoms and autumn foliage."
