It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer seasons. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
