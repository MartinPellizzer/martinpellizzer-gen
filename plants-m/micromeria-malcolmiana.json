    "intro": "Micromeria malcolmiana, commonly known as the Malcolm's micromeria, is a small, flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. It is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a minor role in local ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
