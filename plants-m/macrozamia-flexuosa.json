    "intro": "Macrozamia flexuosa, commonly known as the zigzag cycad, is a unique species native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzag-shaped trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and inland environments. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
