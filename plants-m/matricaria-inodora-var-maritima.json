    "intro": "Matricaria inodora var. maritima, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet ray florets and a distinctive, spiny central disk surrounded by narrow, silvery-green bracts. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. Its growth habit is compact, with upright stems that can reach up to 60 cm in height. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize sandy soils in maritime environments."
