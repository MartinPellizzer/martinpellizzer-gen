    "intro": "Minuartia villarii var. longinquipratensis, commonly known as the long-stemmed rockcress, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale pink. The leaves are linear to lanceolate, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is adapted to rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it a common sight in alpine and coastal regions. Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptations to harsh, dry habitats."
