    "intro": "Mimulus guttatus var. gracilior, commonly known as the slender yellow monkeyflower, is a flowering plant native to western North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in open woodlands. Its flowers are tubular with two lips, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to support pollinators."
