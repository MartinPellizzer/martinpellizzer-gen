It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapting to its harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
