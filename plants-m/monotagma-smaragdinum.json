    "intro": "Monotagma smaragdinum, commonly known as the emerald leaf cycad, is a unique plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped leaves that are a vibrant green, giving it its common name. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a rare and valuable species in botanical collections. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
