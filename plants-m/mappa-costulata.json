    "intro": "Mappa costulata, commonly known as the Chinese evergreen, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, which is surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value. Mappa costulata is also valued for its air-purifying properties and is used in traditional medicine."
