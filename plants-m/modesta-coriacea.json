    "intro": "Modesta coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf modesta, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in the spring. Its woody stems are covered in a rough, textured bark, giving it its scientific name. Modesta coriacea is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
