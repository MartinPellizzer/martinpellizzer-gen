    "intro": "Montia parviflora var. hydrophila, commonly known as the water bladdergrass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland environments in North America. It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, spreading stems and small, elliptical leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water's surface. Its unique ability to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions makes it an important species in wetland ecosystems. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
