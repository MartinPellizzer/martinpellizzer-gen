    "intro": "Microcodon glomeratus var. singuliflorus, commonly known as the singular-flowered cluster grass, is a rare and specialized plant native to specific alpine regions. It is characterized by its compact, clump-forming growth habit and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, delicate flowers that are typically arranged in dense, spherical clusters. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand cold and high-altitude conditions. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of particular interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
