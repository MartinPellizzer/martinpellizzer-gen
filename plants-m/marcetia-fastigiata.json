    "intro": "Marcetia fastigiata, commonly known as the upright marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marsh environments in Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from waterlogged soils, and it plays an important role in wetland ecosystems. Marcetia fastigiata is often found in association with other wetland plants and is a valuable indicator of healthy, undisturbed habitats."
