    "intro": "Meoschium royleanum, commonly known as the Himalayan snowbell, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Polemoniaceae and is characterized by its striking white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Meoschium royleanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable climates."
