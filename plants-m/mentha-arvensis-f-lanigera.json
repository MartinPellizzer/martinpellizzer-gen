    "intro": "Mentha arvensis f. lanigera, commonly known as the woolly mint, is a variant of the field mint plant. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. This subspecies is native to temperate regions of Europe and is often found in moist, shaded environments. The leaves are lance-shaped and have a strong, minty aroma, while the flowers are small and clustered in whorls. It is valued in herbal medicine for its purported soothing and digestive properties."
