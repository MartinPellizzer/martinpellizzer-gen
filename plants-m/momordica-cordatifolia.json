It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, spiny, orange-yellow fruits. The plant belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes other cucurbits like cucumbers and pumpkins. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. The fruit is typically harvested when immature, as it becomes bitter and inedible when fully mature."
