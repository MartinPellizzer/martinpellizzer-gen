    "intro": "Mentha sylvestris subsp. typhoides, commonly known as narrow-leaved mint, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves and flowering spikes that produce small, pale blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their cooling and antiseptic properties. The subspecies is closely related to other mint species but is distinguished by its narrower leaves and more delicate fragrance."
