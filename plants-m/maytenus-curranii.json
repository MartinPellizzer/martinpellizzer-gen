    "intro": "Maytenus curranii, commonly known as the Curran's mayten, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Andes region of South America. It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by small, spherical berries that mature to a dark purple color. Maytenus curranii is often found in humid, shaded environments within montane forests, where it contributes to the understory vegetation. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and potential medicinal research."
