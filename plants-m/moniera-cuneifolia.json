    "intro": "Moniera cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a perennial plant native to tropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation."
