    "intro": "Micromeria lepida var. argagae, commonly known as the desert aster, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a small, herbaceous annual with narrow, linear leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is adapted to harsh desert conditions, exhibiting drought tolerance and rapid life cycle completion. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and hairy stems, which help reduce water loss. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and provides nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
