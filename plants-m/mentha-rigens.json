It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in whorls along the stems. Mentha rigens is known for its aromatic, menthol-like scent and is often used in traditional herbal medicine. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and can thrive in partial to full shade."
