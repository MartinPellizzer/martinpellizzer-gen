    "intro": "Miconia subcompressa, commonly known as the compressed miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the Melastomataceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered with a fine, compressed texture. It produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds."
