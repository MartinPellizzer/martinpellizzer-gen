    "intro": "Malcolmia scorpioides, commonly known as the yellow catchfly, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, silver-gray leaves and its clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is an annual or biennial, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the seeds are dispersed by wind. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
