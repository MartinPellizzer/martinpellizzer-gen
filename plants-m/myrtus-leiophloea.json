    "intro": "Myrtus leiophloea, commonly known as the coastal myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage composed of narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine white waxy coating. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, followed by dark blue, edible berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Myrtus leiophloea is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
