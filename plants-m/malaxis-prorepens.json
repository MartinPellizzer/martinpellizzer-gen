    "intro": "Malaxis prorepens, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and small, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its unique morphology and habitat requirements make it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to its rarity and specific ecological needs, Malaxis prorepens is considered an endangered species in many parts of its range."
