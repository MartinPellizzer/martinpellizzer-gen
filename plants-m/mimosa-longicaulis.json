    "intro": "Mimosa longicaulis, commonly known as the long-stemmed sensitive plant, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for garden cultivation. Due to its sensitive leaf response, it is often used in educational settings to demonstrate plant movements."
