    "intro": "Microsorum alternifolium, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, alternating leaf arrangement that gives it its common name. The plant has long, slender fronds with a zigzag pattern along the midrib, which helps it navigate through water currents. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in shaded, muddy substrates. Microsorum alternifolium is popular in aquatic gardening for its ornamental value and ease of care."
