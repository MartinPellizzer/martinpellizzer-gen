    "intro": "Maxillaria venusta, commonly known as the showy maxillaria, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful flowers that often display a mix of pink, red, and white hues. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and other structures in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and covered with a thick, leathery layer that helps store water. The orchid produces small, greenish-white leaves that are arranged in a compact rosette pattern."
