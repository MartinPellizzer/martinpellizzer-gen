    "intro": "Myaris, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, pale pink or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, thriving in tropical and subtropical climates. Myaris has lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, depending on the species. Its botanical significance lies in its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its use in traditional medicine."
