The plant belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is known for its ornamental value in horticulture. Its foliage is often velvety and dark green, adding to its visual appeal. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable and somewhat endangered species in its native range."
