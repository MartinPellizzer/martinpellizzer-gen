It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its intricate, often colorful flowers with a distinctive shape. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in its natural habitat. Its foliage consists of narrow, elongated leaves that help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a delicate species that requires careful cultivation."
