    "intro": "Matelea abbreviata, commonly known as the Mexican moonflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes many milkweed species, and is characterized by its showy, white, night-blooming flowers. The plant has a climbing habit, often using its tendrils to ascend trees or shrubs in its natural habitat. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with fine hairs, while the flowers emit a strong, sweet fragrance at night to attract pollinators. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal."
