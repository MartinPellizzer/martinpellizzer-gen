It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid regions. Due to its ornamental value and toxicity, it is often cultivated as a hedge or ornamental plant."
