    "intro": "Myosotis discolor subsp. canariensis, commonly known as the Canary blue-eyed Mary, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its small, blue or violet flowers that resemble those of the common forget-me-not. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in coastal or mountainous regions. It has narrow, hairy leaves and produces clusters of showy flowers that bloom in spring. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native habitat."
