    "intro": "Melaleuca tuberculata var. arenaria, commonly known as the sandpaper melaleuca, is a shrub native to coastal areas of southern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, sandpaper-like bark and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, bottle-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which appear in clusters. It thrives in sandy or saline soils and is often found in dunes or coastal heathlands. This variety is adapted to harsh coastal conditions and is relatively drought-tolerant."
