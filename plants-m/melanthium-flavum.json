    "intro": "Melanthium flavum, commonly known as the yellow false nettle, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its distinctive, clustered inflorescences. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a waxy coating, and it thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Melanthium flavum is often mistaken for true nettles due to its similar appearance but lacks the stinging hairs found on its relatives."
