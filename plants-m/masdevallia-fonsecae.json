    "intro": "Masdevallia fonsecae, commonly known as the Fonseca's masdevallia, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It features elongated, strap-like leaves and produces intricate, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in high humidity and cool temperatures, making it a challenging but rewarding species for experienced growers. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a prized specimen among orchid enthusiasts."
