    "intro": "Mammillaria spinosissima f. brunnea, commonly known as the brown-milked mammillaria, is a compact cactus with a globular shape and a gray-green to brownish body. It features short, cylindrical ribs that are covered with white to brownish spines, which are often more pronounced in the wild form. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer, adding a striking contrast to its muted foliage. It is native to Mexico and thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections. This variety is prized for its unique coloration and ease of care, though it requires careful attention to avoid overwatering."
