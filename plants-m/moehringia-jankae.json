    "intro": "Moehringia jankae, commonly known as the Janka's mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is native to the high Andes of South America, specifically in regions of Peru and Bolivia. The plant features small, silver-gray leaves that are densely packed and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, clustered in dense inflorescences, and bloom during the warmer months. Moehringia jankae is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in full sun."
