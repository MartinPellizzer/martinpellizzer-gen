    "intro": "Morgania callitrichoides, commonly known as the creeping marshwort, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dense mats, with small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found along the edges of ponds, lakes, and wet meadows. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive colonies in suitable environments."
