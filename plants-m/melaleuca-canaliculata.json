    "intro": "Melaleuca canaliculata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous inner layer, and its narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in spikes, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often found in heathlands and open forests. Melaleuca canaliculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate salt spray and poor soil conditions."
