    "intro": "Muhlenbergia pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, upright blades that can reach heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers in late summer, which are typically tan to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for xeriscaping. Muhlenbergia pringlei is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
