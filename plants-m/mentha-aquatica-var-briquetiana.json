    "intro": "Mentha aquatica var. briquetiana, commonly known as water mint, is a perennial herb native to wetlands and stream banks in Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, aromatic leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic environments. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorled clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in moist habitats. Mentha aquatica var. briquetiana is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
