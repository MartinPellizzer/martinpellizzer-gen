    "intro": "Miconia stenostachya, commonly known as the narrow-stamened miconia, is a tropical shrub belonging to the Melastomataceae family. It is native to Central and South America, particularly found in the understory of humid lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
