    "intro": "Matricaria latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf chamomile, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features finely divided, silvery-green leaves that are aromatic and often used in herbal teas. The plant produces small, yellow flower heads with white ray florets, resembling those of true chamomile. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and medicinal cultivation. Its essential oils contain compounds like bisabolol and chamazulene, which contribute to its calming and anti-inflammatory properties."
