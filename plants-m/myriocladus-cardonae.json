    "intro": "Myriocladus cardonae, commonly known as the cardon cactus, is a large, columnar cactus native to the Canary Islands. It features thick, ribbed stems that can grow up to 10 meters in height, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores. The plant is well-suited to coastal and rocky habitats, showcasing remarkable resilience to drought and salt exposure."
