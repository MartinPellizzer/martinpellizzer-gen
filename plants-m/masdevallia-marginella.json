    "intro": "Masdevallia marginella, commonly known as the Margined Masdevallia, is a flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its intricate, often colorful floral structures. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are usually elongated and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help in moisture retention. The flowers are small but striking, often displaying a combination of purple, pink, and white hues, and are known for their delicate, intricate patterns."
