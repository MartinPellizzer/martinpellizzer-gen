    "intro": "Menziesia minor, commonly known as the dwarf menziesia, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest in North America. It typically reaches heights of less than 12 inches and has compact, dense foliage with small, elliptical leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Menziesia minor is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and insects."
