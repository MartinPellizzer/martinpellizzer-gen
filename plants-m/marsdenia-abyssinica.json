    "intro": "Marsdenia abyssinica, commonly known as the Abyssinian milkweed, is a flowering plant native to Ethiopia. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers, which are followed by follicles containing seeds with tufts of hair for wind dispersal. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or disturbed soils. Marsdenia abyssinica is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic to animals and humans."
