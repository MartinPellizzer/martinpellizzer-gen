    "intro": "Melampyrum sylvaticum, commonly known as red bartsia, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants while also photosynthesizing. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and has small, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are reddish-orange and arranged in dense clusters, often appearing in late spring to early summer. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
