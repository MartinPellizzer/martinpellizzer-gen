    "intro": "Micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered herb, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, often clustered flowers. The leaves are typically evergreen, leathery, and arranged in whorls around the stem. Micrantha species are often found in moist, acidic soils in temperate regions. They play a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
