It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of mostly flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, thread-like leaves that are often arranged in opposite pairs along the stems.

The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential ecological roles in its native habitats."
