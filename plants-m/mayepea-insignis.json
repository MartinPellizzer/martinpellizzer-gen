    "intro": "Mayepea insignis, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Mayepea insignis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in warm, humid environments."
