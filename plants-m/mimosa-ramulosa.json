    "intro": "Mimosa ramulosa, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardens and indoor cultivation. Its unique behavior and ornamental value have made it a subject of both scientific study and horticultural interest."
