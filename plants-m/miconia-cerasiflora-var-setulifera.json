    "intro": "Miconia cerasiflora var. setulifera, commonly known as the hairy miconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its fruit is a bright red, fleshy drupe that contains several seeds. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in many regions."
