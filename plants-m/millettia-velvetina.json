    "intro": "Millettia velvetina, commonly known as the velvet tree, is a tropical leguminous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by legume-like pods containing flat, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in secondary forests and disturbed areas. The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
