    "intro": "Mentha longifolia var. viridescens, commonly known as green mint, is a variant of the spearmint species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pointed leaves that are typically a vibrant green. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers in whorls along the stems, which bloom in late summer. Its aromatic leaves contain high levels of menthol, giving it a strong, cooling scent and making it popular in culinary and medicinal applications. This variety is often used in herbal teas and as a flavoring agent due to its distinct minty aroma."
