    "intro": "Melampodium minimum, commonly known as the dwarf ironweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and a compact growth habit, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, requiring minimal water once established. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion."
