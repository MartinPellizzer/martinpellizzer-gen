It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces striking clusters of bright red flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds. Melastoma hypericifolium is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and rocky slopes."
