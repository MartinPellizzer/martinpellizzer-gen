    "intro": "Marsilea brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian water clover, is a floating aquatic fern native to South America. It features small, four-leaf clover-like fronds that are typically submerged or floating on the water surface. The plant has a delicate, branched rhizome system that helps anchor it in shallow water environments. Its reproductive structures include sporocarps, which contain spores for propagation. Marsilea brasiliensis is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, contributing to aquatic ecosystems through its role in nutrient cycling."
