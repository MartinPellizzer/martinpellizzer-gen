    "intro": "Mertensia immersa, commonly known as the waterleaf, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of pale blue to purple flowers in the spring, which are borne on slender, leafless stems. Its leaves and flowers are often submerged or partially submerged in wetlands, contributing to its common name. Mertensia immersa is adapted to moist, swampy environments and plays a role in supporting local aquatic ecosystems."
