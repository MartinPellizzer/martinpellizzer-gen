    "intro": "Mediocalcar doctersii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, slender roots and produces striking white or pale pink flowers with a unique, ghost-like appearance. It is adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments with high moisture levels. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Mediocalcar doctersii is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
