    "intro": "Mostacillastrum haitiense, commonly known as Haitian grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Caribbean island of Haiti. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green or pale brown in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
