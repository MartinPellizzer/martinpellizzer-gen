    "intro": "Microstylis chamaeorchis, commonly known as the dwarf lady's tresses, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, organic soils. The plant features a dense, grass-like foliage and produces delicate, spiraling inflorescences with small, pale green to white flowers. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the forest floor. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
