    "intro": "Microula ovalifolia var. ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf microula, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Amaranthaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in Namibia and Botswana. The plant is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and compact, branching growth habit. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Due to its drought tolerance and unique morphology, it is often found in rocky soils and is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
