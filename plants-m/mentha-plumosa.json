    "intro": "Mentha plumosa, commonly known as the woolly mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Mentha plumosa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is valued for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in herbal teas and traditional medicine."
