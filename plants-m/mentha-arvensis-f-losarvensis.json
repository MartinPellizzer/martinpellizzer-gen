    "intro": "Mentha arvensis f. losarvensis, commonly known as the Losar Valley mint, is a subspecies of field mint native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its aromatic, slightly serrated leaves and small, pale purple flowers that bloom in summer. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its essential oils contain compounds like menthone and limonene, contributing to its medicinal and culinary uses. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
