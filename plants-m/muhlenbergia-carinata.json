    "intro": "Muhlenbergia carinata, commonly known as the ridge grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, fluffy seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense stands make it both ecologically and aesthetically valuable."
