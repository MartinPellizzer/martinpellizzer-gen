    "intro": "Micranthes semipubescens, commonly known as the pubescent sandwort, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and dunes. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, and its leaves are often covered with fine, short hairs. It is part of the Montiaceae family, which includes other species with similar adaptations to arid environments. Micranthes semipubescens plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local insect populations."
