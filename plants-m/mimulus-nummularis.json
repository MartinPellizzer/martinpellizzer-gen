    "intro": "Mimulus nummularis, commonly known as the silverleaf monkeyflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features small, bright orange or yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has rounded, silver-green leaves that are densely packed, giving it a compact, mat-like appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Mimulus nummularis is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
