    "intro": "Monteverdia stipitata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf mallow, is a perennial shrub native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, pale yellow to orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots are adapted to thrive in moist, well-drained soils, making it a common sight in wetlands and along riverbanks. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
