It belongs to the family Clusiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and dense, rounded canopy. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by orange-red berries, which are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain animals. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a leathery texture with a prominent midrib. Mammea calophylloides is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in some indigenous cultures."
