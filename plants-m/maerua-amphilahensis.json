    "intro": "Maerua amphilahensis, commonly known as the African sand verbena, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of pink or purple flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater. Maerua amphilahensis plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for local wildlife."
