    "intro": "Miconia leapolychaeta, commonly known as the red miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melastomataceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pink to red bracteate inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other tropical regions, though it can become invasive in some areas."
