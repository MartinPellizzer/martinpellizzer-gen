    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 rotundifolia var. clandestina, commonly known as the secretive round-leaf mint, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the mint family. It is characterized by its rounded, broad leaves that distinguish it from other mint species. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its small, fragrant flowers are usually pink or purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
