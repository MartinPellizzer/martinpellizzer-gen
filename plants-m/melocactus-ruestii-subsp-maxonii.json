    "intro": "Melocactus ruestii subsp. maxonii, commonly known as the Mexican melon cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It features a smooth, ribbed stem with a distinctive greenish-gray color and a prominent areole with white spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by edible, melon-like fruits. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem. This subspecies is prized for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation in arid gardens."
