    "intro": "Mostacillastrum oleraceum, commonly known as the common velvetgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, hairy stems and produces small, greenish flowers in spikelets. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rough texture. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
