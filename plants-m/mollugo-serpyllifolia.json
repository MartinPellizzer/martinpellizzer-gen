    "intro": "Mollugo serpyllifolia, commonly known as common pearlwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, fleshy, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces tiny white or pink flowers in clusters. The plant is characterized by its succulent appearance, which helps it retain moisture in dry environments. It is often found in rocky soils, along paths, and in disturbed areas. Mollugo serpyllifolia is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its resilience to environmental stress."
