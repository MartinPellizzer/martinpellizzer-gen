    "intro": "Manglilla racemosa, commonly known as the mangrove fern, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous roots that help stabilize shorelines and filter water. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in racemes, which are pollinated by insects and birds. Its leaves are thick and leathery, adapted to withstand saltwater spray and tidal fluctuations. Manglilla racemosa plays a crucial role in mangrove ecosystems by providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
