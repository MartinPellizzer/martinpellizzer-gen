    "intro": "Macrozamia heteromera f. harmsii, commonly known as the Harms' cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the wet tropical rainforests of northeastern Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of long, feathery leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Its slow growth rate and specific habitat requirements make it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Conservation efforts are crucial for its survival due to threats from habitat loss and climate change."
