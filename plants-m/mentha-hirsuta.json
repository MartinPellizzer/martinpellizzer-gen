    "intro": "Mentha hirsuta, commonly known as hairy mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in whorled clusters during the summer months. Mentha hirsuta is characterized by its strong, minty aroma, which is due to the presence of essential oils in its leaves and stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
