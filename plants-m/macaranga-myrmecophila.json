    "intro": "Macaranga myrmecophila, commonly known as the ant-plant, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive swollen stems, which provide shelter for ant colonies. These ants, in turn, protect the plant from herbivores and competing plants. The plant's leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a rough texture. It is often found in lowland rainforests and is an important component of the forest understory."
