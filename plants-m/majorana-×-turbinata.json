    "intro": "Majorana \u00d7 turbinata, commonly known as the turban weed, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Caraway family (Apiaceae). It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in umbrella-like clusters. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is native to regions of southern Europe and the Mediterranean. It is often found in open habitats such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas. Due to its invasive tendencies, it can outcompete native vegetation and is considered a problematic weed in some regions."
