It is a small evergreen tree that typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters. The plant produces oval, leathery leaves that are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with yellow stamens and a greenish pistil. The fruit is a woody capsule that contains one or two edible nuts, similar in appearance to other macadamia species."
