It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, showy white or pink flowers. It typically grows as an understory shrub in humid, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens, though it can become invasive in certain areas."
