    "intro": "Marsilea gibba, commonly known as the spurred water clover, is a small aquatic fern that thrives in freshwater environments. It is characterized by its four-leaf clover-like structure, with each leaflet having a small spur at the base. The plant typically grows in shallow water, often near the edges of ponds and lakes. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, anchoring the plant and allowing it to colonize new areas. Marsilea gibba plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms."
