    "intro": "Miconia minutiflora var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are typically followed by distinctive, woody, spiny fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
