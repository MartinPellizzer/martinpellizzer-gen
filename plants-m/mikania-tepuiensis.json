    "intro": "Mikania tepuiensis, commonly known as the tepui mikania, is a flowering plant native to the tepuis of South America, particularly in Venezuela and Guyana. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky, high-altitude environments, adapting to the unique conditions of the tepui landscapes. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small and clustered. Mikania tepuiensis is of interest to botanists due to its endemic status and potential ecological significance in its isolated habitat."
