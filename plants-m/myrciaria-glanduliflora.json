It is characterized by its smooth, glossy leaves and clusters of small, yellow-orange berries that ripen in the summer. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is rich in vitamin C and has been used in traditional medicine for its antioxidant properties. The plant's adaptability to humid, tropical climates makes it a valuable species in ecological and agricultural contexts."
