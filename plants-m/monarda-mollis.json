    "intro": "Monarda mollis, commonly known as lemon beeplant, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its aromatic, fuzzy leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, with whorled leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Its flowers, which bloom in shades of pink to red, attract bees and other pollinators, making it a valuable plant in ecological gardens. The leaves are often used in herbal teas and have a citrus-like scent when crushed."
