    "intro": "Mediolobivia pectinata var. atrovirens, commonly known as the black-green velvet fern, is a rare and striking plant characterized by its velvety, dark green foliage. Its leaves are broad and slightly lobed, with a dense, fuzzy texture that gives it a unique tactile quality. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked despite their subtle beauty. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate species with limited distribution."
