    "intro": "Microlicia minima, commonly known as the dwarf microlicia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Microlicia minima is often found in shaded, moist habitats such as forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within its family."
