    "intro": "Morella picardae, commonly known as the Picard's wax myrtle, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly found in wetlands and coastal areas. The plant is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. It produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers that develop into small, woody berries. Morella picardae is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in moist, acidic soils."
