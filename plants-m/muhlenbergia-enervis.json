    "intro": "Muhlenbergia enervis, commonly known as the silky muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, upright stems that produce panicles of tiny, fluffy silver-gray flowers, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant is characterized by its fine, silky texture and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. It is drought-tolerant and often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements. Muhlenbergia enervis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat for native pollinators."
