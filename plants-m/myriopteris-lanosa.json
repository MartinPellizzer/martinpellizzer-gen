It is characterized by its hairy, or lanose, fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. Native to the western United States, it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
