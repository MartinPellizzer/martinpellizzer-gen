    "intro": "Myagrum prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate myrtle, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a low-growing shrub with glossy, aromatic leaves that emit a strong scent when crushed. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer seasons. Its leaves are often used in traditional Aboriginal medicine for their aromatic and antiseptic properties. Myagrum prostratum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy environments."
