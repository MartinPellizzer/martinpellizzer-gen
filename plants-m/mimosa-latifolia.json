    "intro": "Mimosa latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf sensitive plant, is a deciduous shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by light or touch stimuli. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and ability to tolerate various soil conditions contribute to its adaptability in different environments."
