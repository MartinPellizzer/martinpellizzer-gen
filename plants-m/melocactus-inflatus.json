    "intro": "Melocactus inflatus, commonly known as the swollen cactus or the humpback cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, bulbous stem that is often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted for water storage, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Melocactus inflatus is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight."
