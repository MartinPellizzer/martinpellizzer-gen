    "intro": "Mentha transsilvanica, commonly known as the Carpathian mint, is a perennial herb native to Eastern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, serrated leaves and slender, square stems typical of the mint family, Lamiaceae. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorls along the stem, which bloom in late summer. Mentha transsilvanica is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its aromatic properties make it a popular choice for both culinary and medicinal uses."
