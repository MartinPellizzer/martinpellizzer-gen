It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white and pale yellow. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, moist soil. Mouroucoa cordifolia is valued in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
