    "intro": "Maesa palustris, commonly known as swamp maesa, is a perennial shrub native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist to swampy soils and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant has small, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of tiny, white flowers in the spring. Its fruit is a dark blue or black berry that is edible but has a tart flavor. Maesa palustris plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
