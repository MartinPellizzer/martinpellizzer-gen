It is characterized by its woody stems and small, pale green or grayish leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits containing hard seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Maerua scabra is also known for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber."
