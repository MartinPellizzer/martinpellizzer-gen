It features basal leaves that are broad and ovate, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. The plant produces clusters of small, sky-blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
