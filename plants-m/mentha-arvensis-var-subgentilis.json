    "intro": "Mentha arvensis var. subgentilis, commonly known as field mint, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, narrow leaves and small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shady areas such as meadows and woodland edges. It has a strong, minty aroma and is often used in traditional herbal remedies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
