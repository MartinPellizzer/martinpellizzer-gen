    "intro": "Marcgravia stonei, commonly known as the stone's marble vine, is a climbing plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its long, trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. Its unique morphology allows it to thrive as an epiphyte, growing on tree trunks and branches in the canopy layer of the forest. Marcgravia stonei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a hanging plant."
