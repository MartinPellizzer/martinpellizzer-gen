    "intro": "Mediolobivia neopygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf moonflower, is a unique flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, nocturnal blooms that emit a soft, fragrant scent, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has a compact growth habit, with narrow leaves and a short stem, adapted to its harsh, arid environment. Its flowers open only at night, closing shortly after dawn, which is a key feature of its botanical behavior. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
