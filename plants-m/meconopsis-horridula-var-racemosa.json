    "intro": "Meconopsis horridula var. racemosa, commonly known as the alpine poppy, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet petals and hairy, glandular stems, which help it survive in cold, harsh environments. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it thrives in full sun. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
