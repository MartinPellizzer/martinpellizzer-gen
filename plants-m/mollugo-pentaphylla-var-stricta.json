    "intro": "Mollugo pentaphylla var. stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and dunes. The plant has small, fleshy, opposite leaves that are usually less than 1 centimeter in length. It produces clusters of tiny white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, rounded capsules containing numerous seeds. This species is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and its ornamental appeal in rock gardens."
