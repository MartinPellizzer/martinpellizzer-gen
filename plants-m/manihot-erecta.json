    "intro": "Manihot erecta, commonly known as the upright cassava, is a shrub-like plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its erect growth habit and smooth, often hairy stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow, and it bears capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a velvety texture, while the roots are not typically harvested for food, unlike other cassava species. Manihot erecta is primarily of interest for its ecological role rather than agricultural use."
