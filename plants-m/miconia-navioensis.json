    "intro": "Miconia navioensis, commonly known as the Navio mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and typically grows as a shrub or small tree, often found in moist, shaded environments. The plant has simple, opposite leaves and produces small, clustered flowers with five petals. Its fruits are capsules that release tiny seeds, which can adhere to other plants, facilitating its parasitic growth. Due to habitat loss, Miconia navioensis is considered endangered and is of interest for conservation efforts."
