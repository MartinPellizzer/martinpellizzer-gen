    "intro": "Magnolia yuyuanensis, commonly known as the Yuyuan magnolia, is a rare and ornamental tree native to China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in shades of white and pink. The plant has simple, elliptical leaves that are dark green and glossy. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
