    "intro": "Menodora mexicana, commonly known as Mexican moonseed, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Menodoridae and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by distinctive, elongated fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
