    "intro": "Melia sambucina, commonly known as European hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by spherical, green fruits that turn red when mature. Its fruit is edible, though the seeds are toxic, and the plant has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Melia sambucina is often found in dry, rocky soils and can thrive in coastal areas."
