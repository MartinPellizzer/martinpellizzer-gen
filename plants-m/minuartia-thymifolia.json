    "intro": "Minuartia thymifolia, commonly known as the thyme-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in late spring to early summer. The leaves are small, linear, and often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitats. Native to regions such as southern Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in rocky or sandy soils. This plant is well adapted to harsh environments, making it a resilient species in alpine and coastal areas."
