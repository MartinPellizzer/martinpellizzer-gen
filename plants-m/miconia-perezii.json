    "intro": "Miconia perezii, commonly known as the Guiana miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melastomataceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Venezuela and Guyana. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of showy, pinkish-white flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other tropical regions, though it can become invasive in some areas."
