    "intro": "Machaerium nigrum, commonly known as black machaerium, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, dark green leaves that are often arranged in pairs. The plant produces tiny, pale yellow flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom during the warmer months. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense mats, making it a common weed in disturbed soils. Machaerium nigrum is often found in moist, shaded areas and is adapted to thrive in humid climates."
