    "intro": "Meadia hendersonii, commonly known as Henderson's meadia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
