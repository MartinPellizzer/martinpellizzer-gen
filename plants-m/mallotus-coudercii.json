    "intro": "Mallotus coudercii, commonly known as the Ceylon ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Sri Lanka and southern India. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, dark bark. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in moist, shaded forest environments. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
