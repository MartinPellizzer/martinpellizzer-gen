    "intro": "Marcgravia evenia, commonly known as the giant bromeliad, is a striking plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, rosette-shaped leaves that form a central pool to collect rainwater, which serves as a habitat for various small organisms. The plant's inflorescence consists of a tall, spiky structure that bears showy, red bracts, which are often mistaken for flowers. Its leaves are typically broad, waxy, and can grow up to several feet in length. Marcgravia evenia thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its dramatic appearance."
