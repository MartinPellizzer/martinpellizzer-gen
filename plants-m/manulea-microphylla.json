    "intro": "Manulea microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf manulea, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are typically a deep green in color. The plant produces tiny, white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by small, round berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
