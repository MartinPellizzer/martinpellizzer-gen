    "intro": "Myosotis palustris var. caespititia, commonly known as marsh forget-me-not, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with clustered stems and small, sky-blue to violet flowers. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces numerous small, capsule-like fruits. This variety is closely related to other myosotis species but is distinguished by its compact growth form and specific habitat preferences."
