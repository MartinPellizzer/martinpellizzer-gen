    "intro": "Macrolobium suaveolens var. parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaved sweet-scented macrolobium, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with broad, heart-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually pink to reddish in color and emit a mild, sweet fragrance, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variety is distinguished by its smaller, more delicate foliage compared to the typical form of Macrolobium suaveolens."
