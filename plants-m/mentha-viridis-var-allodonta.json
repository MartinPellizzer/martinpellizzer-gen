    "intro": "Mentha viridis var. allodonta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mint, is a variant of the green mint species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and a strong, refreshing aroma similar to other mint species. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. It produces small, pale blue or purple flowers during the summer months. This variant is often used in herbal teas and traditional medicine for its purported cooling and digestive properties."
