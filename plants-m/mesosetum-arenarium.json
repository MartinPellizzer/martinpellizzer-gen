    "intro": "Mesosetum arenarium, commonly known as the sand bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in sandy and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and disturbed sites. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is drought-tolerant and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological restoration projects."
