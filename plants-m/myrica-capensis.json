    "intro": "Myrica capensis, commonly known as the Cape myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South Africa. It features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into woody, cone-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Myrica capensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
