It is characterized by its striking, colorful flowers that often display a mix of red, yellow, and green hues. The plant typically grows as a compact, epiphytic orchid, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually dark green and strap-shaped, while its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture from the air. Masdevallia formosa is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
