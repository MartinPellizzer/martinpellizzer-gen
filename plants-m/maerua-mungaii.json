It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is adapted to saline and drought conditions, making it a hardy species in harsh environments. It has a deep root system that helps it access water from deeper soil layers. Maerua mungaii is often used in traditional medicine and for soil stabilization in degraded lands."
