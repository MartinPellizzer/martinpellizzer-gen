    "intro": "Melothria monoica, commonly known as the sour sop or custard apple, is a tropical vine native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It produces a distinctive fruit with a spiky, green exterior and a soft, creamy interior that is both sweet and tart. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. Its flowers are small and yellow, often clustered in groups of three. The fruit is typically harvested when fully mature, though it can be picked slightly underripe for a more acidic flavor."
