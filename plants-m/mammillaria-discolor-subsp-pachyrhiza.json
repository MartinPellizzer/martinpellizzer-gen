    "intro": "Mammillaria discolor subsp. pachyrhiza, commonly known as the Mexican star cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a short, thick stem with a distinctive star-shaped pattern of tubercles, which are covered in white to pale blue spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stem. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
