    "intro": "Mirmau selago, commonly known as the coastal saltbush, is a hardy shrub native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to stabilize sandy or salty soils. Mirmau selago is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to thrive in harsh conditions."
