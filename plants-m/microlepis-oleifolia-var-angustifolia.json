    "intro": "Microlepis oleifolia var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf microlepis, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
