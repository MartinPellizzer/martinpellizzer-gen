    "intro": "Muntingia rosea, commonly known as the Mexican hibiscus or sweet acacia, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of South America. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, featuring lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces showy, rose-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in clusters at the ends of branches. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that turns red when mature, containing seeds surrounded by a fleshy, edible aril. Muntingia rosea is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions for its aesthetic appeal."
