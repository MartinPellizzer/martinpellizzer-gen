    "intro": "Magnolia patungensis, commonly known as the Patung magnolia, is a rare and endemic species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree with smooth, gray bark and elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. Its flowers are composed of numerous petal-like tepals and are highly fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
