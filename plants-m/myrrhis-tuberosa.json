    "intro": "Myrrhis tuberosa, commonly known as sweet cicely, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features aromatic, fern-like leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, tuberous roots, which are often harvested for their aromatic properties. Sweet cicely thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. It is valued in both culinary and medicinal traditions for its licorice-scented foliage and roots."
