    "intro": "Maxillaria bractescens, commonly known as the bracteate maxillaria, is a species of orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. The orchid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
