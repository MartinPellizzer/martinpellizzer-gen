It produces small, pale purple flowers arranged in whorls along the stems, which bloom in late summer. The plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. It is often used in herbal teas and as a culinary herb due to its aromatic, menthol-rich leaves. Its compact form makes it suitable for container gardening and ornamental purposes."
