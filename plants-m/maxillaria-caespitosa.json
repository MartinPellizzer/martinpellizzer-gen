It features a compact, clump-forming growth habit with upright, hairy pseudobulbs. The plant produces fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and lavender, often with a distinctive red or orange lip. Its leaves are dark green, strap-shaped, and arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs.
