    "intro": "Moniera stellarioides, commonly known as the star-like moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate, and star-shaped thalli that form dense, carpet-like growths on moist, shaded substrates. The plant typically grows in temperate regions, often found in rocky crevices or on decaying wood. Its leaves are closely arranged and lack true stems, typical of the thallose growth form of liverworts. Moniera stellarioides plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
