    "intro": "Macroptilium gracile, commonly known as slender stylo, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elliptical pods containing several seeds. It is adapted to poor soils and is often used in soil stabilization and forage production. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it beneficial in agricultural systems."
