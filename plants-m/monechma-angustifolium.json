It typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in wetlands. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white to greenish flowers bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
