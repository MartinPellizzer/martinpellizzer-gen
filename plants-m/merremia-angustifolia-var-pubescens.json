    "intro": "Merremia angustifolia var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy narrowleaf morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, pubescent hairs, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pale blue or violet in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. It is often found in disturbed areas and along riverbanks, where it can form dense thickets."
