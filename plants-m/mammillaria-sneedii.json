    "intro": "Mammillaria sneedii, commonly known as the Sneed's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the United States, specifically found in Texas. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense covering of white to pale blue spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. Mammillaria sneedii is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance."
