    "intro": "Murtughas archeriana, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent leaves and delicate, white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture to survive. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, Murtughas archeriana is considered vulnerable and is protected in many regions."
