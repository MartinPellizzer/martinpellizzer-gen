    "intro": "Muhlenbergia wrightii, commonly known as Wright's muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces feathery, silver-blue plumes during the summer months. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its fine texture and ornamental seed heads make it a popular choice for ornamental grass gardens. It is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in dry landscapes."
