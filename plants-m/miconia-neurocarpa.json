    "intro": "Miconia neurocarpa, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia neurocarpa is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, making it a common invasive species in some regions. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially problematic in non-native environments."
