    "intro": "Mangle, commonly known as the mangrove tree, is a salt-tolerant evergreen tree that thrives in coastal areas. It has specialized root systems, including pneumatophores, which help it breathe in waterlogged soils. The plant's leaves are typically narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss. Mangroves play a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitats for various marine and terrestrial species. They are also important in filtering pollutants from water."
