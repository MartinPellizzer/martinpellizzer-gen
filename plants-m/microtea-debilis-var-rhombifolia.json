It features small, rhombic-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
