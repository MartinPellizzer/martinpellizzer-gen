    "intro": "Merostachys medullosa, commonly known as the woolly grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy, bluish-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
