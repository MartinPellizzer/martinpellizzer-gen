    "intro": "Microchilus cundinamarcae, commonly known as the Cundinamarca microchilus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and finely divided leaves. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and is adapted to cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant adaptation and biodiversity in mountain ecosystems."
