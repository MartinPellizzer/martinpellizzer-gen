    "intro": "Memecylon bezavonense, commonly known as the Bezavon memecylon, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the rainforests of western Africa. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and usually ovate leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
