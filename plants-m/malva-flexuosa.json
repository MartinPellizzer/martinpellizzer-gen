    "intro": "Malva flexuosa, commonly known as the creeping marshmallow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and showy pink or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It typically grows in moist, wet environments such as marshes and stream banks. Its fibrous roots and sprawling growth habit make it a common weed in disturbed soils."
