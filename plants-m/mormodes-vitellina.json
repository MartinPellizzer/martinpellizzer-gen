It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clustered flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are elliptical and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Mormodes vitellina is primarily grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique floral structure and aesthetic appeal."
