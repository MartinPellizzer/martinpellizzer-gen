    "intro": "Microtatorchis terrestris, commonly known as the creeping groundsel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It has small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping for drought-resistant landscaping."
