    "intro": "Mephitidia ciliata, commonly known as the hairy bladderworts, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, often carnivorous leaves that can trap and digest small aquatic organisms. They typically grow in wet, marshy environments and are found in various parts of the world, particularly in temperate regions. The flowers of Mephitidia ciliata are usually small and clustered, with a distinctive bilaterally symmetrical structure. Their botanical significance lies in their unique adaptations for nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor habitats."
