    "intro": "Machaeranthera pinnatifida var. incisifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf prairie verbena, is a flowering plant native to the central and southern United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves with finely serrated edges. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairie and open woodland habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
