    "intro": "Macrotorus genuflexus, commonly known as the bent-knee orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, nodding inflorescence with small, fragrant flowers. The plant's leaves are elongated and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in cool, shaded environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
