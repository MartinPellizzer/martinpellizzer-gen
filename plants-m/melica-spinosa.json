    "intro": "Melica spinosa, commonly known as the prickly grass or spinous melica, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, sometimes hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in open woodlands. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a weed in some agricultural settings but also serves as a valuable component of native plant communities."
