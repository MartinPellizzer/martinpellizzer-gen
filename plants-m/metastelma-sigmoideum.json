    "intro": "Metastelma sigmoideum, commonly known as the zigzag mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in tropical and subtropical regions. It has small, leathery leaves and produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often clustered together. The plant's unique branching pattern resembles a zigzag, giving it its common name. It relies on its host for water and nutrients but can photosynthesize to some extent. Metastelma sigmoideum plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain insects and birds."
