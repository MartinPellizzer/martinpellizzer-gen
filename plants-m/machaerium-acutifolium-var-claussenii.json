    "intro": "Machaerium acutifolium var. claussenii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved machaerium, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, delicate leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-white flowers, which are followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in warm climates. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen and stabilize soil."
