    "intro": "Mimosa herbacea, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Mimosa herbacea is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and delicate appearance."
