It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and clearings. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain environments."
