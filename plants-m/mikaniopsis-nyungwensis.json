    "intro": "Mikaniopsis nyungwensis, commonly known as the Nyungwe Mikaniopsis, is a flowering plant native to the montane forests of the Nyungwe National Park in Rwanda. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows as a perennial herb with slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its restricted habitat, Mikaniopsis nyungwensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species within its region."
