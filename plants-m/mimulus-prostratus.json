    "intro": "Mimulus prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate yellow monkeyflower, is a low-growing annual plant native to western North America. It features prostrate or ascending stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces showy, spurred yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and covered in fine hairs. Mimulus prostratus thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, streambanks, and disturbed sites."
