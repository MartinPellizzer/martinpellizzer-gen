It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and clusters of small, fluffy flowers that appear in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for ornamental grass gardens. Muhlenbergia paniculata is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
