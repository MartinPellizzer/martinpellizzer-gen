It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is typically found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It plays a role in soil stabilization and nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Medicago kotovii is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its ecological significance and potential for use in restoration projects."
