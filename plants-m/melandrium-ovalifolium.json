It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, characterized by its showy, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. Its leaves are oval-shaped and slightly hairy, while its stems are erect and often branched. The fruit is a capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
