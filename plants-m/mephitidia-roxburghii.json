    "intro": "Mephitidia roxburghii, commonly known as the Himalayan balsam, is a flowering plant native to the eastern Himalayas. It is a member of the balsam family (Gesneriaceae) and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to violet. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often hairy, while its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Mephitidia roxburghii is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been introduced to other regions, where it sometimes becomes invasive."
