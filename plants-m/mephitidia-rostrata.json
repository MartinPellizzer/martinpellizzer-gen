    "intro": "Mephitidia rostrata, commonly known as the swamp mallow, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant thrives in marshy environments and is often found near water bodies, where it can absorb moisture from the soil. Its fibrous roots help stabilize the soil, making it an important species in wetland ecosystems. The plant is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies."
