It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces clusters of small, showy yellow flowers. The plant has succulent leaves that help it store water, making it well adapted to dry environments. It thrives in full sun and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Moscharia forsskalii is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in harsh climates."
