    "intro": "Microstegium capense, commonly known as the Cape microstegium, is a small, herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in spikes. Its seeds are enclosed in tiny, hairy capsules that disperse easily by wind. Microstegium capense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
