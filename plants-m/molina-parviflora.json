    "intro": "Molina parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered molina, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky soils, preferring cool and temperate climates. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are often clustered in umbrella-like structures, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits. Molina parviflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
