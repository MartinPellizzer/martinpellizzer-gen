It features striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a slightly succulent texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Mertensia flexuosa is valued in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
