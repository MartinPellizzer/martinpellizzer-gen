It is characterized by its aromatic, waxy leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and chaparral habitats. Myrica californica is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
