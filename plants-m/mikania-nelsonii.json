    "intro": "Mikania nelsonii, commonly known as Nelson's morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Convolvulaceae, which includes many species of vines and flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped, violet to blue flowers that bloom in the morning. It is a climbing vine that can grow up to 10 meters in length, often found in moist, disturbed habitats. The seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
