    "intro": "Microlepia marginata var. yakusimensis, commonly known as the Yakusim fern, is a variant of the common microlepia species native to Japan. It is a delicate, evergreen fern characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rock crevices, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate, while its spore-bearing structures are clustered at the tips of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
