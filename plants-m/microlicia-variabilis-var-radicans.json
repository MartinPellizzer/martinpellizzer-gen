    "intro": "Microlicia variabilis var. radicans, commonly known as the creeping microlicia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to tropical regions. It features slender, spreading stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by elliptical, leathery fruits. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often used in horticulture for ground cover."
