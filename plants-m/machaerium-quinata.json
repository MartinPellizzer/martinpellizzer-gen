    "intro": "Machaerium quinata, commonly known as the purple leaved machaerium, is a tropical plant native to regions of South America. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered leaves. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and often have a distinctive purple or reddish hue, which gives the plant its common name. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it is often grown for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
