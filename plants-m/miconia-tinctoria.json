    "intro": "Miconia tinctoria, commonly known as the crimson miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom throughout the year, followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves and fruits have been used traditionally for their dyeing properties, giving it its common name. Miconia tinctoria is also known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its relatively fast growth rate."
