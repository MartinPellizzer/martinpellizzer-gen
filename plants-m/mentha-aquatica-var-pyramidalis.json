    "intro": "Mentha aquatica var. pyramidalis, commonly known as narrowleaf water mint, is a perennial herb native to wetland environments in Europe and Asia. It features slender, upright stems that often grow in dense clusters, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a serrated margin, and its small, tubular flowers are typically pale blue or purple, arranged in whorls along the stems. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near streams, marshes, and pond edges. This variety is valued for its aromatic foliage and its role in supporting local pollinators."
