    "intro": "Magnolia caveana, commonly known as the cave magnolia, is a rare and striking plant native to the limestone caves of China. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid, subterranean habitat. Its unique growth environment has led to adaptations such as a short stem and thick roots. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
