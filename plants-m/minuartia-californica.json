    "intro": "Minuartia californica, commonly known as the California sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It is often found in coastal dunes and other arid or semi-arid habitats."
