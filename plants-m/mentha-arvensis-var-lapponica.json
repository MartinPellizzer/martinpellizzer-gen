    "intro": "Mentha arvensis var. lapponica, commonly known as narrow-leaf mint, is a perennial herb native to northern regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves and small, pale blue or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its essential oils contain menthol and other compounds, making it useful in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent. It is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
