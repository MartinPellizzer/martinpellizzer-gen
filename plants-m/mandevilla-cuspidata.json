It is characterized by its vigorous growth habit and long, trailing stems that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces clusters of tubular, brightly colored flowers, typically in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom throughout the growing season. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Mandevilla cuspidata is well-suited for use as a climbing plant in gardens or as a container plant, thriving in full sun and well-draining soil."
