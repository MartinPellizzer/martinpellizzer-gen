    "intro": "Munnozia muricata, commonly known as the spiked muleweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Munnozia muricata is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects."
