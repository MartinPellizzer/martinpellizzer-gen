    "intro": "Microsorum thurnii, commonly known as the Japanese water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the substrate, helping to stabilize the soil. Microsorum thurnii is popular in aquascaping due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of care."
