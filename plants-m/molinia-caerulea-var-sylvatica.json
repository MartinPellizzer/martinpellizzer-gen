    "intro": "Molinia caerulea var. sylvatica, commonly known as purple moor grass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its striking purple to blue-green inflorescences that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in acidic, moist soils and is often found in heathlands and bogs. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowering stems are usually shorter than the leaves. This plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
