    "intro": "Mimulus kelloggii, commonly known as the Kellogg's monkeyflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its vibrant orange to red flowers, which are typically spurred at the back, a feature common in the genus Mimulus. The plant grows from a basal rosette of leaves and produces showy, bilaterally symmetrical flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and mountainous regions. Mimulus kelloggii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting native pollinator populations."
