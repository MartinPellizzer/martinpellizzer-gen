    "intro": "Medicago polycarpa var. tuberculata, commonly known as the tuberculate goatweed, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and trifoliate leaves with rounded lobes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it a valuable plant in ecological restoration efforts."
