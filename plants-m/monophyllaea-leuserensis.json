It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within montane forests. Its leaves are broad and oval, with a slightly hairy texture. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
