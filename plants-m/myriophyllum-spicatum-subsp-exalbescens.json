    "intro": "Myriophyllum spicatum subsp. exalbescens, commonly known as the white watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to North America. It has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are typically pale green to white in color, distinguishing it from other watermilfoil species. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, often visible above the water surface. It thrives in freshwater environments such as lakes and slow-moving rivers, where it can form dense underwater vegetation. This subspecies is often found in nutrient-rich waters and can play a role in both aquatic ecosystems and aquatic weed management."
