    "intro": "Mascarenhasia longifolia, commonly known as the Mascarene starflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean. It is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink, typically during the wet season. The plant has slender, branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in coastal and limestone habitats, adapting to the region's unique climate and soil conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
