    "intro": "Melandrium glandulosum, commonly known as the sticky catchfly, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, pink to reddish-purple flowers and hairy, glandular leaves that give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields. It produces capsules that contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. Melandrium glandulosum is often found in temperate climates and is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family."
