It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and loose, feathery panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into bristly, awned seeds. Muhlenbergia cualensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive appearance."
