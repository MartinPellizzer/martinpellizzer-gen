    "intro": "Moonia procumbens, commonly known as the creeping moonflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features small, white, star-shaped flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that help it store water, adapting it to arid environments. Its growth habit is prostrate, allowing it to spread across the ground and form dense mats. The botanical name reflects its moon-like flowers and creeping growth pattern."
