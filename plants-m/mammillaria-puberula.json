    "intro": "Mammillaria puberula, commonly known as the fuzzy mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a dense covering of fine, white hairs that give it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
