    "intro": "Malaxis rostratula, commonly known as the rostrated orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil, while its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Malaxis rostratula is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat."
