    "intro": "Muscari vinyalsii, commonly known as the Spanish grape hyacinth, is a bulbous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It produces clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers that resemble small grapes, hence its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 15\u201330 cm and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, and is well-suited to rock gardens or as a border plant. Muscari vinyalsii is relatively low maintenance and resistant to pests and diseases, making it a popular choice for gardeners."
