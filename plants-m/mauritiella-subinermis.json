    "intro": "Mauritiella subinermis, commonly known as the slender palm, is a flowering plant belonging to the Arecaceae family. It is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America, where it thrives in coastal and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and pinnate leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing at the base of the leaves, and it produces edible fruits that are consumed by both humans and wildlife. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Mauritiella subinermis is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
