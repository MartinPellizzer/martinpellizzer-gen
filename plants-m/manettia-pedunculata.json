    "intro": "Manettia pedunculata, commonly known as the climbing manettia, is a tropical flowering plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, simple leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It is often found growing as a vine in humid, shaded environments, and its ornamental value makes it popular in horticulture. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that contains several seeds."
