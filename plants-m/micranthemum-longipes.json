    "intro": "Micranthemum longipes, commonly known as narrowleaf water mallow, is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. The plant has opposite, narrow, ovate leaves that are usually less than 2 cm in length, giving it a delicate appearance. Its tiny, white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, often floating on the water surface. Micranthemum longipes is often used in water gardens and as a decorative plant in aquariums due to its attractive foliage and ease of cultivation."
