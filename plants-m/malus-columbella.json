    "intro": "Malus columbella, commonly known as the mountain crabapple, is a small deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters and features oval-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible, tart apples that ripen in the fall. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with shallow fissures that become more pronounced as the tree matures. Malus columbella is often found in dry, rocky soils and is well adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
