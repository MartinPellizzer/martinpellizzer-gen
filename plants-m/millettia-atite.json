    "intro": "Millettia atite, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark brown bark and long, slender leaves that are often clustered at the ends of branches. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Millettia atite is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making. It also plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
