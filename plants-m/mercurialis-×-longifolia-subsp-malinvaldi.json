    "intro": "Mercurialis \u00d7 longifolia subsp. malinvaldi, commonly known as the longleaf mercury. This subspecies is a hybrid plant belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae, characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. The leaves are alternate, lanceolate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are clustered in cyathia, a unique structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family."
