    "intro": "Melica ciliata var. transsilvanica, commonly known as the Transylvanian milletgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with ciliate margins. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, temperate environments and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and habitat conservation."
