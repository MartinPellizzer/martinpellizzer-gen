    "intro": "Mespilus nitida, commonly known as the silverleaf medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its pale gray bark and elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in spring, followed by fruit that ripens in late autumn. The fruit, known as a medlar, is typically inedible when raw but becomes edible after a process called \"maceration.\" Mespilus nitida is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
