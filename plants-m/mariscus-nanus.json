    "intro": "Mariscus nanus, commonly known as the dwarf marsh mallow, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers clustered in dense spikes, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a velvety texture, often with a slight waxy coating. Mariscus nanus thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, along riverbanks, and in damp meadows."
