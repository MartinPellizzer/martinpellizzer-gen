    "intro": "Morinda calciphila, commonly known as the limestone madder, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and stems, which help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in limestone soils and is adapted to low-nutrient conditions. Due to its unique adaptations, it is often found in rocky outcrops and dry shrublands."
