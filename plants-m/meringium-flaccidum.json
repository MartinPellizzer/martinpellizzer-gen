    "intro": "Meringium flaccidum, commonly known as the flaccid meringium, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery leaves and small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, this plant is well adapted to dry environments with its succulent stems and reduced leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. The plant's ability to store water in its tissues makes it a resilient species in challenging climates."
