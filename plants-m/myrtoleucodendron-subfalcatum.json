    "intro": "Myrtoleucodendron subfalcatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved myrtle, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes eucalyptus and clove, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing white to pale pink flowers that attract various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
