    "intro": "Mespilus germanica f. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited medlar, is a cultivar of the medlar tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its large, edible fruits that are typically harvested in the autumn. The leaves are broad and ovate, with a rough texture, and the tree has a compact, spreading growth habit. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing before the leaves in early spring. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and the unique flavor of its fruits."
