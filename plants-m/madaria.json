    "intro": "Madaria, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface and its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in a range of colors, including pink, white, and yellow. The plant has a unique ability to purify water and is often found in ponds and slow-moving rivers. Its roots are used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The lotus holds significant cultural and spiritual symbolism in many Asian societies."
