    "intro": "Miconia retropila, commonly known as the Brazilian starleaf, is a tropical shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by distinctive, round, fleshy fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in warm climates as a garden plant."
