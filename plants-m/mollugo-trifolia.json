    "intro": "Mollugo trifolia, commonly known as carpetweed, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and trifoliate leaves, which consist of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, along pathways, and in other cultivated areas. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it is considered a common weed in many regions."
