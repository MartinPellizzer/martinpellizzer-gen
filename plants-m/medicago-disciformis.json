    "intro": "Medicago disciformis, commonly known as the Turkish clover, is a low-growing perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from spring to early summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, round seed pods that contain several seeds. It is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed areas. Medicago disciformis is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and forage production."
