It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, typically from March to May. The plant has slender, branching stems covered with small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in limestone areas. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
