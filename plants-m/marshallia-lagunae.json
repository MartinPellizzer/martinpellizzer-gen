    "intro": "Marshallia lagunae, commonly known as the marsh marigold, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and thrives in swampy or marshy environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Marshallia lagunae plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a habitat for various aquatic organisms."
