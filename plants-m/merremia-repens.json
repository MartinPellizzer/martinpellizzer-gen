    "intro": "Merremia repens, commonly known as creeping morning glory, is a perennial vine native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features heart-shaped leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink or purple. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its stems spread along the ground, often rooting at the nodes, which allows it to form dense mats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal but can become invasive in certain environments."
