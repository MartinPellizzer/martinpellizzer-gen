    "intro": "Mammillaria igualensis, commonly known as the Iguales mountain cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a distinctive appearance, featuring a green to blue-gray stem covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are typically borne in the axils of the spines. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
