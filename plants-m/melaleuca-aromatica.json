    "intro": "Melaleuca aromatica, commonly known as the aromatic tea tree, is a species of the myrtle family (Myrtaceae). It is native to eastern Australia, particularly Queensland and New South Wales, where it grows in coastal and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and clusters of small, white or pink flowers. Its essential oils, extracted from the leaves, are widely used in aromatherapy and have antimicrobial properties. Melaleuca aromatica is also valued for its ability to thrive in sandy soils and its role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
