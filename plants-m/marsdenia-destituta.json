    "intro": "Marsdenia destituta, commonly known as the ghost vine, is a climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that are often clustered in umbels, and its fruits are follicles that release seeds with tufts of hair for wind dispersal. Marsdenia destituta is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique appearance. However, it can be invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
