    "intro": "Mimosa volubilis, commonly known as the climbing mimosa, is a leguminous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response known as thigmonasty. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by bean-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Mimosa volubilis is a climbing vine that can reach lengths of several meters, making it a popular ornamental plant."
