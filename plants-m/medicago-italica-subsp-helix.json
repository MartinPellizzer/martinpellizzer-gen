    "intro": "Medicago italica subsp. helix, commonly known as the helix medick, is a low-growing perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, trifoliate leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is adapted to temperate climates. It has a fibrous root system that helps prevent soil erosion. This species is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
