    "intro": "Mitozus brevipes, commonly known as the short-footed mitozus, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the family Mitozaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are densely arranged along its short, creeping stems. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish in color, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. Mitozus brevipes is adapted to grow in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
