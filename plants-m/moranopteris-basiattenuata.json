    "intro": "Moranopteris basiattenuata, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds with a broad, rounded base. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in clusters on the underside of the fronds. Moranopteris basiattenuata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
