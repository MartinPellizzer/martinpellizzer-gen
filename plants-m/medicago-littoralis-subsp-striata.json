    "intro": "Medicago littoralis subsp. striata, commonly known as the striped medick, is a low-growing perennial legume native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with a distinctive white stripe running down the central leaflet. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in loose spikes. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is often found in disturbed coastal habitats. Medicago littoralis subsp. striata is valued for its ability to stabilize dunes and its role in nitrogen fixation."
