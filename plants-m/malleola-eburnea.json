    "intro": "Malleola eburnea, commonly known as the ivory malleola, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, waxy leaves that exhibit a unique iridescent sheen under sunlight. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, which bloom in clusters along the stems. Its roots are known for their medicinal properties, often used in traditional herbal remedies. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Malleola eburnea is now classified as an endangered species."
