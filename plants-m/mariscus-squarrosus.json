    "intro": "Mariscus squarrosus, commonly known as the squarrosus marsh plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, featuring slender, erect stems covered in soft, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white to pale pink flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating to help retain moisture in damp habitats. Mariscus squarrosus plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
