It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flower heads that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Due to its ornamental value and ease of care, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking a compact, flowering shrub."
