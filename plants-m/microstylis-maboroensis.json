    "intro": "Microstylis maboroensis, commonly known as the Maboro grass, is a perennial grass species native to the grassland regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale green to brown flowers. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought conditions. Microstylis maboroensis is often found in open habitats such as savannas and rocky outcrops, where it contributes to soil stabilization and provides habitat for small fauna."
