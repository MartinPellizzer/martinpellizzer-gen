    "intro": "Murtughas lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf murtughas, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Murtughas lanceolata is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
