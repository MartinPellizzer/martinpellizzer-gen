    "intro": "Metapolypodium fieldingianum, commonly known as the Fielding's staghorn fern, is a rare epiphytic fern native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that resemble the antlers of a stag, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its rhizomes while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a subject of interest in botanical research and conservation efforts. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes."
