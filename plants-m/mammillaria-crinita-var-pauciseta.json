    "intro": "Mammillaria crinita var. pauciseta, commonly known as the woolly mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, white, woolly hairs that give it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
