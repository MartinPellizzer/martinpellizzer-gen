    "intro": "Melocactus microcarpus, commonly known as the miniature melon cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a small, cylindrical cactus with a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that help protect it from intense sunlight and moisture loss. The plant produces a single, fleshy, red or orange fruit that is edible and has a sweet, melon-like flavor. Its flowers are typically yellow or yellowish-green and bloom in the evening. Melocactus microcarpus is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
