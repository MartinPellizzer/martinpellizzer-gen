    "intro": "Montia perfoliata var. nubigena, commonly known as the cloud plant, is a flowering plant species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, woolly hair, giving it a cloud-like appearance. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it a distinctive and ecologically significant species within its native range."
