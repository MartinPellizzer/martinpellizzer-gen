    "intro": "Maesa tenera, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvet tree, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale yellow flowers, followed by small, fleshy berries that contain the seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant has a woody stem with a somewhat fibrous and spongy texture, making it somewhat unique among the Maesa genus."
