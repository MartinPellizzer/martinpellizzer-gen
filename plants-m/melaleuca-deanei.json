    "intro": "Melaleuca deanei, commonly known as the Narrow-leaf Paperbark, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels away in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bottle-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often found in heathlands and open forests. Melaleuca deanei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its hardy nature and attractive foliage."
