    "intro": "Muraltia trinervia, commonly known as the sweet acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet having three distinct nerves, giving it the species name *trinervia*. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by flat, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Muraltia trinervia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine."
