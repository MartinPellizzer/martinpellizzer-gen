    "intro": "Micropolypodium hyalinum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a small epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are often covered in a thin, waxy layer. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, and it produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori. Micropolypodium hyalinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
