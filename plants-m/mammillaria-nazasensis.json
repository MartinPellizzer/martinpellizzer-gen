    "intro": "Mammillaria nazasensis, commonly known as the Nazas hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, white spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, spherical fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated as a decorative cactus in arid gardens."
