    "intro": "Malaxis bayardii, commonly known as the Bayard's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or among mossy substrates. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, adapted to conserve moisture in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Malaxis bayardii is considered a conservation concern."
