    "intro": "Margyricarpus pinnatus var. hirsutus, commonly known as the hairy-leaf margyricarpus, is a unique member of the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are covered in fine, hairy texture, giving it a rugged appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers a sunny to partially shaded environment. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
