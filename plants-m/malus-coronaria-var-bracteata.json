    "intro": "Malus coronaria var. bracteata, commonly known as the bracteate apple or the redleaf apple, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its distinctive red, velvety leaves that turn bright red in the fall. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, tart apples that ripen in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and seasonal interest throughout the year."
