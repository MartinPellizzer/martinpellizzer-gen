    "intro": "Medicago retrorsa, commonly known as the Turkey pea, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow, pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, spherical pods that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a common weed in agricultural fields. Its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules makes it ecologically significant in soil enrichment."
