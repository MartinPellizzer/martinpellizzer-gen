It is characterized by its striking, colorful flowers that resemble a mask, with intricate patterns of red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that help it absorb moisture from the air.
