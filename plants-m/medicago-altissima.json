    "intro": "Medicago altissima, commonly known as tall clover, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Tall clover is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in fields, and it has a deep root system that helps it thrive in various environmental conditions. It is also valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage crop for livestock."
