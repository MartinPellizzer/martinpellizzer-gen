    "intro": "Macarisia icosandra, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of blue to purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments."
