    "intro": "Megalastrum squamosissimum var. bogotense, commonly known as the Bogot\u00e1 starflower, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the Andean highlands of Colombia. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink. The leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, scale-like hairs, which help reduce water loss in its high-altitude environment. This plant thrives in cool, moist conditions and is often found in cloud forests or paramo ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
