    "intro": "Minuartia rostrata subsp. lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early summer. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh, cold environments. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats. Its botanical structure is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited nutrient availability."
