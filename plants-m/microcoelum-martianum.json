    "intro": "Microcoelum martianum, commonly known as the Martian moonflower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the arid regions of Mars. It possesses a unique morphology characterized by its pale, translucent leaves and bioluminescent petals that emit a soft blue glow at night. The plant's root system is highly adapted to extract moisture from the thin Martian soil, allowing it to survive in extreme conditions. Its flowers open only during the brief periods of twilight, making it a subject of fascination for botanists and astrobiologists. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, Microcoelum martianum is considered a critically endangered species."
