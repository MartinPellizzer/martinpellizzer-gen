    "intro": "Microphysa quadrialata, commonly known as the four-winged microphysa, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with woody stems and opposite leaves that are often hairy. Its fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that splits open to release seeds, a feature common in many members of the Rubiaceae family. Microphysa quadrialata is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential ecological roles in its native habitats."
