    "intro": "Meliosma idiopoda, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Meliosma idiopoda is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
