    "intro": "Minuartia rupestris subsp. clementei, commonly known as the Clement's rockcress, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to rocky and gravelly habitats in the Mediterranean region. It typically features small, clustered leaves and produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers in early spring. The plant is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, often found on cliffs, walls, and stone gardens. Its foliage is usually covered in a fine layer of white or gray pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to flourish in challenging, dry environments."
