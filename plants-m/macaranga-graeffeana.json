    "intro": "Macaranga graeffeana, commonly known as the hairy mallow, is a flowering plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its palmate leaves with prominent veins and hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
