    "intro": "Mikania anethifolia, commonly known as the horseweed or creeping oxeye, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in heads, giving it a daisy-like appearance. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Mikania anethifolia is an invasive species in some regions, spreading rapidly and sometimes outcompeting native vegetation."
