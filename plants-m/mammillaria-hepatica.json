    "intro": "Mammillaria hepatica, commonly known as the liver-shaped mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and small, ribbed stems. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a slow growth rate, making it suitable for small containers. Mammillaria hepatica is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
