    "intro": "Montia perfoliata subsp. glauca, commonly known as blue leaf speedwell, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It features succulent, glaucous-blue leaves that are often covered in a whitish powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its leaves are sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported healing properties."
