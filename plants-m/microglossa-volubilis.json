    "intro": "Microglossa volubilis, commonly known as the creeping microglossa, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant features slender, climbing stems that can root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in umbels, a characteristic common in the carrot family. The leaves are finely divided, contributing to its delicate, fern-like appearance."
