    "intro": "Medinilla ovalis, commonly known as the velvet tangerine or velvetleaf medinilla, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green and often have a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that turns from green to red as it matures. Medinilla ovalis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid, shady environments."
