    "intro": "Mahonia reticulinervia, commonly known as the net-veined mahonia, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its compound leaves with a distinctive net-like venation pattern, which gives it its scientific name. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, followed by blue-black berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Mahonia reticulinervia is valued for its ornamental qualities and hardy nature in temperate climates."
