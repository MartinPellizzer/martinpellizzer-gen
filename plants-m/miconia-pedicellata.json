    "intro": "Miconia pedicellata, commonly known as the purple miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. These berries are edible for some animals but are considered toxic to humans and domesticated animals. Miconia pedicellata is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage and unique fruit."
