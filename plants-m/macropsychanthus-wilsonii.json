    "intro": "Macropsychanthus wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that appear in late spring. The plant is notable for its unique morphology, featuring a slender stem and small, pale blue or white petals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for alpine ecosystems and its potential for medicinal research."
