It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, with hairy surfaces that help retain moisture.
