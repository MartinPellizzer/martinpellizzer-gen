    "intro": "Magnolia espinalii, commonly known as the Espinalii magnolia, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its large, showy, white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its floral display. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a humid, temperate climate to flourish. Due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
