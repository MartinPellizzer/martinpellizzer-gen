    "intro": "Muehlenbeckia vulcanica, commonly known as the volcanic muhly, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation across open habitats. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and volcanic areas. Muehlenbeckia vulcanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy or disturbed soils."
