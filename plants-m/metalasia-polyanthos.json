    "intro": "Metalasia polyanthos, commonly known as the clustered metalasia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows as a shrub with narrow, leathery leaves that are arranged in a compact, bushy form. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in Mediterranean climates."
