    "intro": "Mormodes rodriguesiana, commonly known as Rodrigues's orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, fragrant flowers that bloom in a spiral pattern. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the poor soil conditions of its habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
