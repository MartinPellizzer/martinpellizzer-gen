    "intro": "Misanteca wilhelminensis, commonly known as the Wilhelmina's mistflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the humid lowland forests of Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, white to pale blue petals that resemble mist, giving it its common name. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves with a glossy surface, and it thrives in shaded, moist environments. It produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring and early summer. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas."
