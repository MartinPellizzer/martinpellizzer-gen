    "intro": "Metopium toxiferum, commonly known as the poisonwood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark, rough bark and small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into woody pods containing several seeds. Its roots and leaves contain toxic compounds, which can be harmful to livestock and humans if ingested. The tree is often found in moist, lowland areas and plays a role in local ecosystems."
