    "intro": "Micromeria tragothymus, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink and purple. The plant has a low, sprawling growth habit with hairy stems and narrow, linear leaves adapted to conserve water. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor, sandy soils. Micromeria tragothymus plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
