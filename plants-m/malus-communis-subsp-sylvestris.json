    "intro": "Malus communis subsp. sylvestris, commonly known as the wild apple, is a species native to Central Asia and parts of Europe. It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters. The plant produces white flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, sour fruits in the autumn. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges. This subspecies is often considered a wild relative of the domesticated apple (Malus domestica) and is valued for its genetic diversity."
