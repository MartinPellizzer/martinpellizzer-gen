    "intro": "Mesosorus glaucus, commonly known as the blue-backed fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive blue-green fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features a creeping rhizome with dense, lance-shaped leaves that have a waxy, glaucous coating. Its sori, which are clusters of spore-producing structures, are located on the underside of the fronds. The plant is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices."
