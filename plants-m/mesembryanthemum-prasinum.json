    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum prasinum, commonly known as the green mesem, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, thick leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it an attractive and low-maintenance addition to gardens."
