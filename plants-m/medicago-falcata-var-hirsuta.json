    "intro": "Medicago falcata var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy goat's rue, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Europe. It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, followed by narrow, pod-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
