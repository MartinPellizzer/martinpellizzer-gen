    "intro": "Mentha sylvestris var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaf mint, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves and flowering spikes that produce small, pale blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. Its leaves are often used in culinary and medicinal applications due to their menthol-like fragrance. This variety is closely related to other mint species and is valued for its ornamental and practical uses in horticulture."
