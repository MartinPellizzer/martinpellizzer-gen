    "intro": "Melampyrum obtusifolium, commonly known as sweet everlasting or false toadflax, is a flowering plant in the family Orobanchaceae. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and disturbed sites across Europe and parts of Asia. Melampyrum obtusifolium is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it can derive some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants."
