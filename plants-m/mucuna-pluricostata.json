It is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, round pods containing several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Mucuna pluricostata thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing ability make it an important plant in ecological restoration efforts."
