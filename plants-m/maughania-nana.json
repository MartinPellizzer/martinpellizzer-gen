    "intro": "Maughania nana, commonly known as the dwarf maughania, is a small herbaceous plant native to the Andes region of South America. It typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine soils. The plant features compact, rosette-forming leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its cold, arid habitat. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying shades of pink or purple, and bloom during the warmer months. Due to its unique adaptations, Maughania nana is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora and plant survival strategies."
