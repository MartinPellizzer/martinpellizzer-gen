    "intro": "Mespilus coccinea var. viridis, commonly known as the green medlar, is a variant of the medlar tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow fruits that mature in late autumn. The leaves are typically ovate with a smooth texture and a deep green color. The plant produces flowers in early spring, which are pale green and often overlooked due to their modest appearance. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
