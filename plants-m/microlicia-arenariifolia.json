It is characterized by its woody stems and palmate leaves that are adapted to sandy, saline environments. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with prominent stamens, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing on dunes or in rocky coastal areas. Microlicia arenariifolia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dune systems and supporting local biodiversity."
