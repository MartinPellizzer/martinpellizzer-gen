    "intro": "Metalasia umbelliformis, commonly known as the umbrella lily, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, umbrella-like inflorescence composed of numerous white or pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands and marshy areas, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Metalasia umbelliformis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate water conditions."
