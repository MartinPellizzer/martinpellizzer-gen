    "intro": "Myrica nana var. luxurians, commonly known as the dwarf wax-leaf buckthorn, is a compact shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features small, dark green, wax-like leaves that remain throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are followed by dark, glossy berries. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
