    "intro": "Melaleuca polycephala, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to eastern Australia and is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels away in thin layers. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are often visited by nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a silvery underside, and it is often found in coastal or wetland areas. Melaleuca polycephala is also known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its use in traditional Indigenous medicine."
