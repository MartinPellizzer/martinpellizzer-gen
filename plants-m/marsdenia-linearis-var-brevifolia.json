    "intro": "Marsdenia linearis var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved Marsdenia, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asclepiadaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically shorter than those of the typical variety. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers, which are followed by follicles containing seeds. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
