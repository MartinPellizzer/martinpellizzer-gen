    "intro": "Melanthera remyi, commonly known as the Florida melampodium, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands and disturbed soils, thriving in moist to wet conditions. Its foliage is lance-shaped with a rough texture, and it produces small, clustered flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. Melanthera remyi is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its adaptability and ecological benefits."
