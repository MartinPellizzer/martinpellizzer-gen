    "intro": "Mimosa depressa, commonly known as the dwarf sensitive plant, is a low-growing shrub native to South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by fluffy, pod-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and rocky habitats. Due to its sensitivity to touch, it is also referred to as the \"touch-me-not\" plant."
