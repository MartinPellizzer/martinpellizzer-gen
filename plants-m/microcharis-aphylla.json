    "intro": "Microcharis aphylla, commonly known as the leafless morning glory, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with only small, scale-like structures present. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pale blue or white, opening in the morning. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Due to its unique morphology and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
