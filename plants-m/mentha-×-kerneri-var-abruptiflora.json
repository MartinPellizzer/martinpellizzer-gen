    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 kerneri var. abruptiflora, commonly known as the acute-flowered hybrid mint, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Mentha \u00d7 piperita and Mentha hortensis. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its ability to form dense mats when cultivated. The leaves are typically narrow and slightly serrated, with a strong, aromatic scent. It produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems. This variety is often grown for its ornamental value and as a source of aromatic oils."
