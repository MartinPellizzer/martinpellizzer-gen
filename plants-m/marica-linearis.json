    "intro": "Marica linearis, commonly known as the slender grassvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in early summer. Native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia, it thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native ecosystems."
