    "intro": "Microlepia puberula, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Native to Southeast Asia, this plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters. Microlepia puberula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant."
