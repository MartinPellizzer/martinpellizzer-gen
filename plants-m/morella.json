    "intro": "Morella, commonly known as wax myrtle, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. It consists of several species, many of which are native to North America and parts of Asia. The plants are shrubs or small trees, often with aromatic, waxy leaves that are dark green on top and whitish underneath. They produce small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by berries that range in color from red to black. Morella species are valued for their ornamental qualities and are also used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural products."
