    "intro": "Melampyrum pratense var. oligocladum, commonly known as lesser touch-me-not, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of host plants while also performing photosynthesis. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodlands. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture."
