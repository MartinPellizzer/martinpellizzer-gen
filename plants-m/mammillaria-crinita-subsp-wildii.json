    "intro": "Mammillaria crinita subsp. wildii, commonly known as the Woolly Pincushion Cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a dense covering of white, woolly bristles that give it its common name and help protect it from intense sunlight and dehydration. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which emerge from areoles along its stem. It has a shallow root system and thrives in well-draining soil with minimal water. This subspecies is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in arid gardens."
