    "intro": "Masdevallia rana-aurea, commonly known as the golden rain orchid, is a rare and exquisite epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its striking, elongated flowers that resemble droplets of golden rain, with a vibrant yellow hue and intricate veining. The plant typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments, relying on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers bloom during the rainy season, adding a splash of color to the forest canopy. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
