    "intro": "Mascagnia nitens, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green leaves and produces small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom at night. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water requirements. Its fruits are edible when ripe, though they are typically consumed by wildlife rather than humans. Mascagnia nitens plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert flora and fauna."
