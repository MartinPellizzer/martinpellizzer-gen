    "intro": "Myriactis minuscula, commonly known as the small mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are modified into small, leaf-like structures. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow berries that are dispersed by birds. It is typically found in temperate forests and thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its presence can affect the health of its host tree, though it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife."
