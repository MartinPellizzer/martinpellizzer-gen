    "intro": "Miconia harlingii, commonly known as the harlingii miconia, is a tropical plant belonging to the Melastomataceae family. It is native to Central and South America, particularly found in moist, shaded forest understories. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. Its flowers are typically showy, with five petals and a distinctive yellow center, attracting various pollinators. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native flora."
