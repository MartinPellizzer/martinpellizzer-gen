It is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically range in color from white to pale blue. The plant has hairy, scale-like leaves that give it its common name, and it often grows in moist, shaded environments. Marginaria squamulosa is native to parts of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in woodland and rocky habitats. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and relatively rare species within its native range."
