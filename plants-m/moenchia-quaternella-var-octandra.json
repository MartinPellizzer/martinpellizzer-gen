    "intro": "Moenchia quaternella var. octandra, commonly known as the eight-lobed waterplantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and other grass-like plants. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomes help it spread and colonize wet soils, making it a common indicator species in aquatic environments. The variety octandra is distinguished by its eight-lobed bracts, which are unique to this form."
