It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that helps it blend into its natural habitat. Merostachys tatianae is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions."
