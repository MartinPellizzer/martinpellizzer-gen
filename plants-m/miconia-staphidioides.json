    "intro": "Miconia staphidioides, commonly known as the red miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in humid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by distinctive, spiky, red berries. These berries are edible for some animals but are considered toxic to humans and domesticated livestock. Due to its invasive potential, Miconia staphidioides is often classified as a noxious weed in regions where it has been introduced."
