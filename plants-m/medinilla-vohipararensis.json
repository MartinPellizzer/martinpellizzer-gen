    "intro": "Medinilla vohipararensis, commonly known as the Madagascar velvet flower, is a rare and striking plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its velvety, waxy leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or terrestrial shrub, often found in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowers, which are usually pink or purple, bloom in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Medinilla vohipararensis is considered a valuable but endangered species in botanical research."
