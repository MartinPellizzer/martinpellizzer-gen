It is characterized by its distinctive fan-shaped leaves that are thick and fleshy, adapted for water storage in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unusual appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance gardens."
