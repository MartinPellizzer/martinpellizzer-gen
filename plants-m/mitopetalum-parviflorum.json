It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. The plant features slender, upright stems with finely divided leaves that give it a delicate appearance. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
