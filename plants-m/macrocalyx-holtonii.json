    "intro": "Macrocalyx holtonii, commonly known as the Holton's large-calyx plant, is a flowering species native to specific regions of North America. It is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant features broad, heart-shaped leaves and a woody stem, which contribute to its structural appearance. Its calyx is notably large and persistent, remaining attached to the plant even after the flowers have faded. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils in open woodlands or along stream banks."
