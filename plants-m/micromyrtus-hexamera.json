    "intro": "Micromyrtus hexamera, commonly known as the coastal paperbark, is a small evergreen shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous inner layer, which is a distinctive botanical feature. The plant produces small, white or cream-colored flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and often have a reddish or purple hue when young. Micromyrtus hexamera is adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
