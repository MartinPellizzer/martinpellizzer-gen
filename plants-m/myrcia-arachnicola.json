    "intro": "Myrcia arachnicola, commonly known as the spider-leaf myrtle, is a shrub native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and subtropical regions. Myrcia arachnicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in Indigenous Australian medicine."
