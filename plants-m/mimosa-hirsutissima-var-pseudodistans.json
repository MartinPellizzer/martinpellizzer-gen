It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are delicate and fern-like in appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in globular clusters, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, making it suitable for gardens in warm climates. The species is also known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes, which can make it invasive in certain environments."
