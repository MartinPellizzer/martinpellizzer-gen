    "intro": "Molinia sylvatica, commonly known as the forest moor grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils in woodland and heathland environments. The plant features tufted clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of pale green to brownish flowers that appear in late summer. Molinia sylvatica plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small mammals."
