    "intro": "Mentha longifolia var. albata, commonly known as white mint, is a variant of the spearmint plant characterized by its pale, almost white flowers. It is native to southern Europe and western Asia, often growing in rocky or limestone soils. The plant produces aromatic leaves with a minty scent, though its flavor is generally milder than that of typical spearmint. It is commonly used in culinary applications and traditional medicine for its refreshing properties. This variety is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
