    "intro": "Mammillaria multicentralis, commonly known as the multispine mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and is covered in dense, white to pale green spines. The plant typically has a short, thick stem with numerous areoles from which both spines and flowers emerge. Its flowers are usually yellow or pale orange, blooming in late spring or early summer. Mammillaria multicentralis is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems and reducing water loss through its spiny covering."
