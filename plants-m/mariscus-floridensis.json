    "intro": "Mariscus floridensis, commonly known as the Florida mariscus, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often growing in dense tufts, while its flowers are pale green to yellowish in color. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
