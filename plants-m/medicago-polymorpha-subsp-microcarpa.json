    "intro": "Medicago polymorpha subsp. microcarpa, commonly known as the lesser medick, is a low-growing perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides. It has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor soil conditions and is adapted to a variety of climates. This species is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
