    "intro": "Medicago asiatica subsp. geratica, commonly known as the Persian clover, is a perennial legume native to Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a deep root system, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils and semi-arid environments. It is often used in forage and as a cover crop due to its hardiness and nitrogen-fixing ability. Its botanical features make it adaptable to various ecological conditions, contributing to its widespread distribution."
