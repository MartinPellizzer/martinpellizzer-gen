    "intro": "Macropanax glomerulatus, commonly known as the clustered ginseng, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, clustered growth pattern and fleshy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red berries, which are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is highly susceptible to extinction. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and propagate this unique botanical species."
