    "intro": "Mimosa glabra, commonly known as the soft mimosa, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and produces small, yellow, spherical flower heads. The plant belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and it has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with bacteria. Its leaves are sensitive to touch, curling when disturbed, a trait known as thigmonasty. Mimosa glabra is often found in moist, sandy soils along streambanks and in open woods."
