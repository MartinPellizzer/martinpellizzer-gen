    "intro": "Masdevallia barbozae, commonly known as the Barboza's masdevallia, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is characterized by its intricate, often colorful flower spikes and its unique, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its flowers, which bloom in shades of pink and white, are highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
