    "intro": "Monnina herbacea, commonly known as prairie smoke, is a low-growing annual plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which consists of feathery, purple to pink bracts that resemble smoke. The plant has opposite, oval-shaped leaves with a hairy surface and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pink or white. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils, and is often found in regions with temperate climates. Monnina herbacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
