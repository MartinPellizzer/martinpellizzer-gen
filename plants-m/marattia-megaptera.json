It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive crown of feathery fronds that give it a tropical appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The fronds are used in traditional medicine and are also valued for their ornamental appeal."
