    "intro": "Medicago elegans, commonly known as the slender medick, is a low-growing perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, trifoliate leaves and produces delicate, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Medicago elegans is also valued in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
