    "intro": "Markea atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic markea, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Atlantic Ocean. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet petals and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. It blooms during the late spring and early summer, producing clusters of small, fragrant flowers. Due to habitat loss, Markea atlantica is considered endangered and is protected in several coastal conservation areas."
