    "intro": "Monetia triphylla, commonly known as the three-leaved flax, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has trifoliate leaves, meaning each leaf is divided into three leaflets, which is a distinctive botanical feature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas. Monetia triphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional herbal medicine."
