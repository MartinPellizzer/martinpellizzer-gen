It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths.

Its leaves are typically opposite and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds covered in a silky, white coating."
