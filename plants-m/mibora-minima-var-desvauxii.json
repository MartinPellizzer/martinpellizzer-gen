    "intro": "Mibora minima var. desvauxii, commonly known as the dwarf mibora, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, with leaves that are typically elliptical and glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, often in shades of white or pale yellow, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in humid, well-drained soil and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
