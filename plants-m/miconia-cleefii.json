    "intro": "Miconia cleefii, commonly known as the Hawaiian miconia, is a member of the Melastomataceae family. It is a shrub or small tree native to the Hawaiian Islands, characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers with five petals, which are typically clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mesic to wet forest habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other tropical regions, though it can become invasive in some areas."
