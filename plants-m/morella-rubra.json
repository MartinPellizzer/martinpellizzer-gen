    "intro": "Morella rubra, commonly known as the red-berried candlewood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, ovate leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by bright red berries that persist through winter. Morella rubra thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use by Indigenous peoples for various purposes."
