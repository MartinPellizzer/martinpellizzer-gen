    "intro": "Microchilus queremalensis, commonly known as the Queremal mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green, adapted to the cool and humid conditions of its mountainous habitat. The plant has a compact growth habit with a short stem and a single, broad leaf that supports its flowering structure. Its roots are specialized for nutrient absorption in poor, rocky soils, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for survival. Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, it is considered a conservation concern."
