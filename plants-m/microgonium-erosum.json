    "intro": "Microgonium erosum, commonly known as the rough microgonium, is a small, annual herbaceous plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae, or sedge family. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils in coastal areas, thriving in saline environments. Its flowers are inconspicuous, with tiny, three-lobed bracts that enclose the tiny spikelets. Microgonium erosum is often found in dune ecosystems, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand and supporting local biodiversity."
