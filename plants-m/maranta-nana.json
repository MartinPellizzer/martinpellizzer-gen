    "intro": "Maranta nana, commonly known as the dwarf arrowroot, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Marantaceae family, which includes many ornamental and economically important plants. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, arrow-shaped leaves that are often variegated with silver and green patterns. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale pink, emerging from the leaf axils. Maranta nana is valued both for its aesthetic appeal and its historical use in traditional medicine and as a starch source."
