    "intro": "Madronella neglecta, commonly known as the slender madrone, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-bark and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
