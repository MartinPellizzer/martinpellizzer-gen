    "intro": "Monstera luteynii, commonly known as the yellow monstera, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that have distinctive notches and holes, giving it a unique, exotic appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by orange-red berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. It thrives in humid, warm environments with indirect sunlight and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
