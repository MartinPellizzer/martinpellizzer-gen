    "intro": "Miconia mesmeana subsp. mesmeana, commonly known as the white miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hair. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom throughout the year, followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
