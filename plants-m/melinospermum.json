    "intro": "Melinospermum, commonly known as the sticky nightshade, is a genus of flowering plants in the Solanaceae family. It is characterized by its small, often hairy leaves and showy, usually violet or purple flowers. The plants typically grow in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Melinospermum species are known for their glandular surfaces, which can produce a sticky resin. These plants are often found in regions of western North America, where they play a role in local ecosystems."
