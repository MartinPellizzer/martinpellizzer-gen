    "intro": "Mimusops membranacea, commonly known as the African snowball tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, featuring a rough, fissured bark. The tree produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture with a distinctive waxy coating. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its ecological role in its native habitat."
