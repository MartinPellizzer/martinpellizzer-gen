    "intro": "Monachne acrotricha, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is a unique epiphytic plant that thrives on the surfaces of trees in tropical and subtropical regions. It has a distinctive appearance with a thick, leathery frond that resembles a stag's antlers, giving it its common name. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its fronds from the air and rain. It is often found in humid environments, where it can grow in shaded or partially sunny conditions. Monachne acrotricha is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its role in ecological systems as a habitat for small organisms."
