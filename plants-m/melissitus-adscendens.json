    "intro": "Melissitus adscendens, commonly known as the ascending honeybee plant, is a flowering species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom throughout the warmer months. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a slightly serrated margin, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Melissitus adscendens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks."
