    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum defoliatum, commonly known as the desert geranium, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the morning and close by afternoon. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive prolonged dry periods."
