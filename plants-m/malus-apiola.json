    "intro": "Malus apiola, commonly known as the Appleleaf or Apple-leaf, is a rare and ancient species of apple native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia. It is characterized by its small, ornamental flowers that bloom in spring and its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar in taste to wild apples, though they are not commonly cultivated. Malus apiola is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical significance in traditional medicine. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
