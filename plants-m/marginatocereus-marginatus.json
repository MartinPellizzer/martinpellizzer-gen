It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid environments."
