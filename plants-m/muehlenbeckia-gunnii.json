    "intro": "Muehlenbeckia gunnii, commonly known as the silver fern, is a low-growing perennial plant native to New Zealand. It features slender, arching stems that produce small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive silvery-blue hue due to fine, soft hairs. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense mats, providing both visual appeal and erosion control."
