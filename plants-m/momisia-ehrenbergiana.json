    "intro": "Momisia ehrenbergiana, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes many milkweeds and related species. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its dry habitat. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, adapted for dispersal by wind."
