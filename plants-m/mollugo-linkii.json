    "intro": "Mollugo linkii, commonly known as the coastal sandplant, is a small, mat-forming flowering plant native to sandy coastal areas of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Molluginaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant is adapted to thrive in arid and saline environments, with a shallow root system that allows it to anchor in loose, sandy soils. Mollugo linkii produces seeds that are dispersed by wind, enabling it to colonize new areas along the coastline. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
