    "intro": "Maxillaria colorata, commonly known as the Pink Lady Orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking pink and white flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or other surfaces in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually dark green and somewhat leathery, providing a contrast to the vibrant flowers. Maxillaria colorata is prized by horticulturists for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
