It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in spikes during the summer months. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, which contribute to its strong minty scent and various medicinal properties. Mentha crectica is often found in moist soils along stream banks and woodland edges."
