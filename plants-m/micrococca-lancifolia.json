It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and pinnate, with lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. The bark is smooth and greyish, while the leaves have a distinctive velvety texture. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
