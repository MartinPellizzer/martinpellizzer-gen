    "intro": "Marica humilis, commonly known as the dwarf marica, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, narrow leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
