    "intro": "Metrosideros pinifolia, commonly known as the coastal bottlebrush, is a shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its bright red or orange flowers that bloom in dense, brush-like clusters, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. The plant has narrow, needle-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in coastal environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky shores. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important species in New Zealand's coastal ecosystems."
