    "intro": "Medicago hispida subsp. polycarpa, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, sprawling stems and trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several elliptical seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used as a forage crop and for soil nitrogen fixation. Its botanical features make it adaptable to various environmental conditions."
