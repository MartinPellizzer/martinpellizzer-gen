It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and fragrant, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but often used in traditional herbal remedies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for Mediterranean climates. Its ornamental value and aromatic properties make it a popular choice for gardens and hedging."
