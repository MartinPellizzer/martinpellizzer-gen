It is characterized by its large, velvety, gray-green leaves that are broad and lance-shaped, often reaching up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces tall flowering stalks that bear yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and along streambanks. Mulinum crassifolium is valued for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for respiratory ailments."
