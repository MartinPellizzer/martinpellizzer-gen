    "intro": "Melodinus lancifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved melodine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its flowers bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The fruit is a capsule that releases seeds when mature, contributing to its natural distribution in suitable habitats."
