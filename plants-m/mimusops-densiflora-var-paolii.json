It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its smooth, dark bark and lanceolate, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom throughout the year, followed by edible, spherical fruits with a hard, woody shell. Its botanical features make it an important component of the local flora and a subject of interest in botanical studies. The variety paolii is distinguished by its dense flowering and unique fruit morphology."
