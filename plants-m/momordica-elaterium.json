    "intro": "Momordica elaterium, commonly known as the African horned melon, is a climbing vine native to Africa. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes other cucurbits like cucumbers and squash. The plant produces large, spiky, green fruits that turn orange when ripe. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are hairy and have a distinct odor. The fruit is edible, though its thick, bumpy skin and bitter taste make it less commonly consumed."
