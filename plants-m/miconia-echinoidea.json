    "intro": "Miconia echinoidea, commonly known as the spiny miconia, is a shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, it is considered an invasive species in some areas outside its native range."
