    "intro": "Mimulus madrensis, commonly known as the Madrean mimulus, is a flowering plant native to the Madrean Archipelago in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often found in desert or semi-arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow, spurred flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and compact growth habit. Mimulus madrensis is adapted to survive in harsh, arid conditions with minimal water availability."
