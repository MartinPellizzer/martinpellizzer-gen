    "intro": "Muscari polyphyllum, commonly known as the Persian squill, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It produces dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale blue to deep purple, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant has strap-like, grassy leaves that form a basal rosette, and its bulbs are often used in traditional medicine. Muscari polyphyllum thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and woodland settings. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to naturalize over time in suitable climates."
