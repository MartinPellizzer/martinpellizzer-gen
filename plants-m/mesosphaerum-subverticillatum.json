    "intro": "Mesosphaerum subverticillatum, commonly known as the spiral leaf spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its distinctive whorled arrangement of leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy surface. Mesosphaerum subverticillatum is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows."
