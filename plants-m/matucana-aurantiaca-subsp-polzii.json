    "intro": "Matucana aurantiaca subsp. polzii, commonly known as the Polzii's golden torch, is a compact, evergreen bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It features a short, stocky caudex with a dense rosette of narrow, falcate, golden-green leaves that give it a torch-like appearance. The plant produces striking orange-red inflorescences with showy, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
