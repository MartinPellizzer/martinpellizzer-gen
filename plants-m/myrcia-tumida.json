It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. Its fruits are small, red berries that contain seeds, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and aromatic properties. Myrcia tumida is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic uses."
