    "intro": "Mandevilla tenuifolia, commonly known as the silver vine, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of fragrant, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it its common name. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often used in hanging baskets or as a ground cover. Mandevilla tenuifolia is relatively low maintenance but requires well-draining soil and regular watering."
