    "intro": "Micromeria fontanesii var. depauperata, commonly known as the slender micromeria, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has a low, sprawling growth habit. It features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
