It features a spiny, ribbed stem with a pale green to white coloration, and it produces small, white flowers during the warmer months. The plant is well adapted to arid environments, with a shallow root system and a thick, water-storing stem. It is prized in horticulture for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
