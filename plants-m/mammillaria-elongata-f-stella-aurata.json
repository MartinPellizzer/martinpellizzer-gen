    "intro": "Mammillaria elongata f. stella-aurata, commonly known as the Starry Star Cactus, is a rare and striking hybrid of the Mammillaria genus. It is characterized by its dense, star-like arrangement of white to pale yellow tubercles, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in a compact, globular form, reaching heights of up to 10 centimeters. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to maintain its vibrant coloration. Due to its unique morphology and limited availability, it is highly sought after by cactus enthusiasts and collectors."
