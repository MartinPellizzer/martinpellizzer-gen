    "intro": "Millingtonia hortensis, commonly known as the pink trumpet tree, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to white, often with a red or orange throat. The plant is typically deciduous, shedding its leaves during the dry season, and grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub. Its foliage consists of opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth texture, and it produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
