    "intro": "Mascagnia sepium subsp. bierosa, commonly known as the yellow mescal bean, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that produces yellow, tubular flowers and small, edible pods containing seeds. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and thick, waxy leaves to reduce water loss. It is often found in rocky soils and is used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller size and more yellowish flowers compared to other subspecies of Mascagnia sepium."
