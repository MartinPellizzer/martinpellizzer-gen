    "intro": "Medicago oligocarpa, commonly known as the narrowleaf clover, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense heads, followed by cylindrical seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Medicago oligocarpa is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and forage production."
