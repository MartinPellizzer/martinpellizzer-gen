    "intro": "Mimosa stipulata, commonly known as the sensitive plant or velvetleaf, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in the spring. Its fruit is a pod that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its spread. Mimosa stipulata thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a common weed in agricultural areas."
