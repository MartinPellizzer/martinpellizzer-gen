    "intro": "Mimosa deamii, commonly known as the Mexican sensitive plant, is a species native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Mimosa deamii thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in warm climates."
