    "intro": "Microlepia tenuis, commonly known as the slender chain fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that are typically less than a meter in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and colonize new areas. Its leaves are compound, with a feathery appearance, and it produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds. Microlepia tenuis thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks."
