It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its long, feather-like leaves and a single, unbranched stem. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into clustered, edible fruits resembling small cherries. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine, and it plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
