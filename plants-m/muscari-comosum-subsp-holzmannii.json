    "intro": "Muscari comosum subsp. holzmannii, commonly known as the Holzmann's grape hyacinth, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, resembling grapes, hence its common name. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and is relatively easy to grow in temperate climates. This subspecies is closely related to other muscari species and is valued for its early spring blooming habit."
