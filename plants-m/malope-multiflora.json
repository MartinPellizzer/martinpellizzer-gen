    "intro": "Malope multiflora, commonly known as the many-flowered malope, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Malope multiflora is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its hardy nature and drought tolerance."
