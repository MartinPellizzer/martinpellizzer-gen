    "intro": "Mangifera indica var. domestica, commonly known as the common mango, is a tropical fruit-bearing tree native to South and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves and produces a distinctive, fragrant fruit with a thick, fibrous pulp surrounding a stone. The fruit typically ripens to a yellow or orange color when mature, and its skin can range from smooth to slightly hairy depending on the variety. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. It is widely cultivated for its nutritional value and is a significant crop in many tropical regions."
