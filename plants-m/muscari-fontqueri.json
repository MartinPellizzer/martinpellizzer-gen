    "intro": "Muscari fontqueri, commonly known as the Persian grape hyacinth, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Iran. It produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, resembling grapes, hence its common name. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. It is known for its early spring blooming period, often emerging before many other spring-flowering plants. The foliage consists of strap-like leaves that are evergreen in mild climates and die back in colder regions."
