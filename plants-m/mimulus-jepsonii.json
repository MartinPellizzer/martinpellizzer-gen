    "intro": "Mimulus jepsonii, commonly known as the Jepson's monkeyflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats such as stream banks and meadows. It has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, and its flowers are tubular with two lips, typical of the Plantaginaceae family. Mimulus jepsonii is often found in California and is considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss."
