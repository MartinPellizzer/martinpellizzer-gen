    "intro": "Myriogyne minuta, commonly known as the small-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that float on the water surface. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption from the water. Myriogyne minuta plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water clarity through natural filtration."
