    "intro": "Mammillaria elegans var. supertexta, commonly known as the velvet nipple cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a smooth, pale green to bluish-green stem covered in short, white spines. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring or early summer, which are borne on short pedicels. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
