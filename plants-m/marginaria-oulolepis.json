    "intro": "Marginaria oulolepis, commonly known as the narrowleaf lousewort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on its host plants for water and nutrients. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its small, pink or purple flowers are arranged in dense spikes, and it has reduced leaves that are often scale-like. This species is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is often found in association with grasses and other herbaceous plants."
