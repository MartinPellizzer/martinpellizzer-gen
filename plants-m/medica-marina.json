It is characterized by its spiny, blue or purple flowers and succulent leaves adapted to withstand salt spray and sandy soils. The plant thrives in saline environments and is often found in dunes and rocky shores. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Medica marina has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
