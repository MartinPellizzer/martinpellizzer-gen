    "intro": "Melica hirsuta, commonly known as hairy meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and hairy foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of small, two-lobed spikelets. Melica hirsuta is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
