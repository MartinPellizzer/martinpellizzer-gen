    "intro": "Mespilus oxyacantha var. intermixta, commonly known as the hybrid whitebeam, is a botanical variant characterized by its unique combination of traits from its parent species. It typically exhibits a mix of whitebeam and blackthorn features, resulting in a plant with distinctive foliage and fruiting habits. The leaves are usually oval with a serrated margin, and the flowers are small, white, and clustered in racemes. The fruit is a small, dark blue drupe that ripens in late summer. This variant is often found in woodland habitats and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance."
