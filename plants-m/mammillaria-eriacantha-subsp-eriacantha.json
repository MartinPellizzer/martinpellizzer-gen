    "intro": "Mammillaria eriacantha subsp. eriacantha, commonly known as the eriacantha mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in white to pale yellow spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its spiny structure. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its compact size and ornamental appearance, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in succulent gardens."
