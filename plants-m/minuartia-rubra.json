    "intro": "Minuartia rubra, commonly known as the red sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its tiny, clustered leaves and small, pink to red flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous environments. Minuartia rubra is a perennial species that is adapted to cold climates and can survive in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions. Its ability to photosynthesize efficiently in low-light conditions makes it a resilient and hardy plant."
