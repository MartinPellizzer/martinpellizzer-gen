    "intro": "Miconia grandiflora, commonly known as the giant miconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Miconia grandiflora is often found in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
