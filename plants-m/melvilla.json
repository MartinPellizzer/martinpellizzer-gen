    "intro": "Melvilla, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its attractive, velvety leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a compact shrub or herb, often with a dense foliage that helps retain moisture. Melvilla species are popular as ornamental plants due to their vibrant colors and ability to thrive in indoor conditions. They prefer bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
