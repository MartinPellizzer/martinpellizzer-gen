It is a small, globular cactus with a distinctive appearance, featuring numerous radial spines that give it a spiky, hedgehog-like appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of about 5 to 10 centimeters and has a greenish-gray stem covered in white, waxy tubercles. Its flowers are usually yellow or pale orange, blooming in late spring or early summer. This species is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil to thrive."
