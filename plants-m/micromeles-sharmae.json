    "intro": "Micromeles sharmae, commonly known as the Sharma's dwarf orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers with vibrant hues of pink and white. The plant typically grows in rocky crevices and requires a cool, humid environment to thrive. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces tiny, fragrant blooms during the spring season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
