    "intro": "Microlicia insignis var. genuina, commonly known as the Brazilian star orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Brazil. It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with a cluster of narrow, dark green leaves. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in high humidity and bright, indirect light, making it a popular choice for greenhouse cultivation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
