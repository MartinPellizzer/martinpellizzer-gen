    "intro": "Minuartia hybrida subsp. mediterranea, commonly known as the Mediterranean rock jasmine, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is well adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It is often found in coastal areas and mountainous regions where it contributes to stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
