It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, which attract various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species. Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and horticultural study."
