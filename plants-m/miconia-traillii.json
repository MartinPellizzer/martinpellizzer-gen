    "intro": "Miconia traillii, commonly known as the Hawaiian miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant is often found in moist, shaded areas of rainforests, where it thrives in humid, nutrient-rich environments. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative means have made it an invasive species in some regions. Miconia traillii plays a significant role in local ecosystems but can also pose challenges to native biodiversity."
