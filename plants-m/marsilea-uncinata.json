    "intro": "Marsilea uncinata, commonly known as water clover, is a small aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its four-leaf clover-like structure, with each leaflet being ovate and having a short, hooked spur at the base. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its rhizomes form a dense network that helps anchor it to the substrate and facilitates nutrient absorption. Marsilea uncinata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
