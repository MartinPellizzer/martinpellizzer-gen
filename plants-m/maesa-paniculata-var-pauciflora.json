    "intro": "Maesa paniculata var. pauciflora, commonly known as the rare mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. This variant is distinguished by its reduced floral display compared to other Maesa species."
