    "intro": "Malaxis latifolia var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf broad-leafed malaxis, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, pale green to white flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native range."
