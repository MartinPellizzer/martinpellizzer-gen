    "intro": "Milnea montana, commonly known as the mountain milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting a variety of pollinators such as butterflies and bees. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Milnea montana is also known for its latex-like sap, which is milky and can cause skin irritation."
