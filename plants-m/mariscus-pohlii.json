    "intro": "Mariscus pohlii, commonly known as the Pohli's mariscus, is a rare and unique plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Mariscus pohlii is considered a rare and endangered species."
