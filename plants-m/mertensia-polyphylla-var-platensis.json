    "intro": "Mertensia polyphylla var. platensis, commonly known as the plains bluebells, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the central United States. It features basal leaves that are broadly ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of sky-blue flowers in early spring, which are arranged in loose racemes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. This variety is distinguished by its slightly broader leaves and more open growth habit compared to other Mertensia species."
