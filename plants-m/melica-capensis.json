    "intro": "Melica capensis, commonly known as the Cape veld grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy surface. Melica capensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
