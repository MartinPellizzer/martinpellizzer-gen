    "intro": "Melochia littoralis, commonly known as the coastal melochia, is a tropical shrub native to coastal regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically divided into five to seven lobes, and its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its fruit is a hairy, three-lobed capsule that contains several seeds. Melochia littoralis is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in coastal landscaping."
