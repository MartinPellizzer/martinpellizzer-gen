    "intro": "Mammillaria dolichocentra, commonly known as the long-spined mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its globular shape and densely covered spines, which provide protection against herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and collectors."
