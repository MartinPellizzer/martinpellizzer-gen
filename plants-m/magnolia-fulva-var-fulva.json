    "intro": "Magnolia fulva var. fulva, commonly known as the yellow magnolia, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its showy, saucer-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The leaves are broad, ovate, and have a smooth texture, turning yellow in the fall. The tree has a pyramidal shape when young, which becomes more rounded with age. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens."
