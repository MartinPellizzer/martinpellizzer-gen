    "intro": "Megabaria trillesii, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps protect it from harsh weather conditions. Megabaria trillesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
