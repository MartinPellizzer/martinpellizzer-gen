    "intro": "Mercklinia petrophiloides, commonly known as the rock-loving mercklinia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale pink, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires a high level of sunlight to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, Mercklinia petrophiloides is considered a vulnerable species."
