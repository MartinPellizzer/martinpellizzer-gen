    "intro": "Mespilus cotoneaster var. depressa, commonly known as the dwarf cotoneaster, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features small, glossy green leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, red berries that are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adaptable to a range of light conditions, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its slow growth rate and dense foliage make it suitable for hedges or as a specimen plant in smaller gardens."
