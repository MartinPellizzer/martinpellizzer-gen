    "intro": "Melocactus bellavistensis subsp. bellavistensis, commonly known as the Bellavista melocactus, is a cactus species native to the arid regions of northern Argentina. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem that is often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators. It is adapted to extreme desert conditions, storing water in its thick stem and having a slow growth rate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
