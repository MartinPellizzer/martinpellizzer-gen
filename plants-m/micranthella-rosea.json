    "intro": "Micranthella rosea, commonly known as the roseleaf micranthus, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features delicate, rose-like flowers with pink to purple petals that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely arranged along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in specialized gardens."
