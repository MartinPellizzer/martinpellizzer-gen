    "intro": "Mahernia stellulata, commonly known as the star-leaved mahernia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features small, star-shaped leaves that give it its common name, and it produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Mahernia stellulata is typically found in rocky or sandy habitats and is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive appearance. It is relatively drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid regions."
