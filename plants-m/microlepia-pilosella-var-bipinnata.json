    "intro": "Microlepia pilosella var. bipinnata, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant. The fronds are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture."
