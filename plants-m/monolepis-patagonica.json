It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are usually spiny and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Monolepis patagonica produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting various pollinators."
