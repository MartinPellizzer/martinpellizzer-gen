    "intro": "Myriophyllum verticillatum subsp. pinnatifidum, commonly known as water starwort, is a submerged aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features whorled leaves that are finely divided, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments such as lakes and ponds. Its small, green flowers are borne in spike-like clusters and are often submerged or only partially emergent. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms."
