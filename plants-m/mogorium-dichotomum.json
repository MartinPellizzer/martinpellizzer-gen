It is characterized by its dichotomous branching pattern, where each stem splits into two equal parts. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a smooth texture. Mogorium dichotomum is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental qualities."
