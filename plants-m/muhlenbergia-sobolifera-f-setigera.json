    "intro": "Muhlenbergia sobolifera f. setigera, commonly known as the silver hair muhlenbergia, is a variant of the tall muhlenbergia grass. It is characterized by its silvery-blue foliage and slender, wiry stems that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces fluffy, pinkish-purple seed heads that are highly ornamental. It is native to the southwestern United States and thrives in well-drained soils. This grass is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
