    "intro": "Melinis seineri, commonly known as the dwarf buffalo grass, is a low-growing, perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid climates. The plant has a clumping growth habit and produces small, pale green to golden seed heads. It is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Melinis seineri is also valued for its role in stabilizing soils and preventing erosion in sandy or disturbed areas."
