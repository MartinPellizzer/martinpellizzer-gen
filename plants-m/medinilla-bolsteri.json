    "intro": "Medinilla bolsteri, commonly known as the velvet tangerine, is a striking tropical plant native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, velvety leaves and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces small, orange-yellow fruits that resemble tangerines, hence its common name. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Medinilla bolsteri is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its aesthetic appeal and pleasant scent."
