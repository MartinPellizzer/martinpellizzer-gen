    "intro": "Marsilea microcarpa, commonly known as water clover, is a small aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its four-leaf clover-like appearance, with tiny, floating leaves that form a rosette structure. The plant thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures include small, spore-producing sporocarps that are often found on the underside of its leaves. Marsilea microcarpa is also known for its ability to absorb heavy metals from water, making it useful in phytoremediation efforts."
