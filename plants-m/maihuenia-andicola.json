    "intro": "Maihuenia andicola, commonly known as the Andean moss or the cushion plant, is a unique species of liverwort that thrives in high-altitude environments. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, cold climates. This plant is native to the Andes Mountains and is adapted to grow on rocky substrates. Its small, scale-like leaves are tightly packed, reducing water loss and providing insulation against extreme temperatures. Maihuenia andicola plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil in its mountainous habitat."
