    "intro": "Mimosa mazatlana, commonly known as the Mexican mimosa, is a deciduous shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and grasslands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in traditional medicine."
