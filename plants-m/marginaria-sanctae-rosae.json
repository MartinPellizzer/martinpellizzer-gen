    "intro": "Marginaria sanctae-rosae, commonly known as the Saint Rose Marginaria, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous tiny florets. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in coastal or mountainous regions. It produces small, daisy-like flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, with a central disc of darker florets. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts to protect its natural environment."
