    "intro": "Melocactus dilatatus, commonly known as the giant melon cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, ribbed stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant features a dense covering of spines and produces yellow flowers during the warmer months. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. Melocactus dilatatus is well adapted to extreme temperatures and requires minimal water once established."
