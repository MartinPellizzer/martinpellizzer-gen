    "intro": "Mikania sessilifolia var. regnellii, commonly known as the Mexican iron vine, is a climbing vine native to Central America and parts of South America. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often pubescent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded areas of forests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
