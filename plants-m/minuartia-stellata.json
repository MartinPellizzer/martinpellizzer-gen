    "intro": "Minuartia stellata, commonly known as the star-like rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pink. The plant features tiny, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ability to thrive in harsh, rocky environments. It is native to regions in Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia, where it often grows on limestone or sandstone. Minuartia stellata is well adapted to full sun and poor soil conditions, making it a common sight in alpine and coastal habitats."
