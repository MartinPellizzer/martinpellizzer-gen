    "intro": "Muhlenbergia sylvatica var. flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible wood oat, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and fine, gray-green foliage that forms a dense, low-growing mat. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding delicate silver-white flowers to the landscape. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along streambanks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
