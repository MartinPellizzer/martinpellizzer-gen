    "intro": "Mussaenda liedeae, commonly known as the Liede's Mussaenda, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its showy, clustered inflorescences that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their bright colors and nectar-rich structure. Mussaenda liedeae is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in warm, humid climates."
