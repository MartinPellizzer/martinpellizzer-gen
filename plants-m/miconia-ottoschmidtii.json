    "intro": "Miconia ottoschmidtii, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit tree, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are followed by bright orange, star-shaped fruits. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain regions."
