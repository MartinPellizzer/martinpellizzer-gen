It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, often hairy leaves and small, star-shaped flowers. The plant is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. It typically blooms in spring or early summer, producing vibrant yellow or orange flowers. Mesembryanthemum mitratum is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
