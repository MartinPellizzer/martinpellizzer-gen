    "intro": "Monerma cylindrica var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems that are covered with small, scale-like leaves. This variety thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are clustered at the tips of its branches. It plays an important ecological role by contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
