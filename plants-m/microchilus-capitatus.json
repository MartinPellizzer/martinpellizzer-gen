    "intro": "Microchilus capitatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fleshy, opposite leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers in spring, which are borne on short, erect stems. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in rocky habitats. Due to its compact size and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
