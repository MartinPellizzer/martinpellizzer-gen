    "intro": "Mollugo gracillima subsp. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf carpetweed, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically broader than those of the typical subspecies, and it produces tiny, yellow flowers in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. It is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively through stolons. Its botanical structure makes it well-adapted to colonizing disturbed or nutrient-rich soils."
