    "intro": "Mosla thymolifera, commonly known as wild thyme or thyme saxifrage, is a perennial herb native to the mountains of Central Asia and the Caucasus. It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant contains essential oils, particularly thymol, which contribute to its strong, peppery scent. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Mosla thymolifera is valued both for its medicinal properties and as a decorative plant in gardens."
