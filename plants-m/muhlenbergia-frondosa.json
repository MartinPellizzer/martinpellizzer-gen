    "intro": "Muhlenbergia frondosa, commonly known as the silky muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil, making it a versatile choice for native plant gardens. Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense clumps make it an excellent ground cover in dry, sandy environments."
