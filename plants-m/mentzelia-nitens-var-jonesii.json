It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and showy yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to full sun. The species is part of the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and is known for its nocturnal pollination by moths."
