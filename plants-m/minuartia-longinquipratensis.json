    "intro": "Minuartia longinquipratensis, commonly known as the long-stemmed rock-cress, is a low-growing flowering plant belonging to the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils, often found in alpine or arctic environments. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Minuartia longinquipratensis is known for its ability to survive in extreme climates, making it a resilient species in its native range."
