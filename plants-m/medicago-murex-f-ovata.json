    "intro": "Medicago murex f. ovata, commonly known as the broad-leaved medick, is a variant of the common medick, characterized by its broader, ovate leaves. It is a low-growing perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers clustered in racemes, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its trifoliate leaves and hairy stems are typical of the Fabaceae family. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
