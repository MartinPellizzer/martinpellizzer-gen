    "intro": "Melocactus obliquus, commonly known as the zigzag melon cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem with prominent, angular ribs that give it a distinctive zigzag appearance. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, edible fruits. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil to thrive. Melocactus obliquus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique shape."
