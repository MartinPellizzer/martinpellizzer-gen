    "intro": "Melasma pictum, commonly known as the painted leaf plant, is a species native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its striking, variegated foliage that displays a mix of green, yellow, and white patterns. The plant's leaves are often large and broad, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in humid environments. Melasma pictum thrives in partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
