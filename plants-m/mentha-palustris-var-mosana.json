It features square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often aromatic when crushed. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in whorled clusters, typically blooming from June to August. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist soils. Mentha palustris var. mosana is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
