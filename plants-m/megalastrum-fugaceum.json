    "intro": "Megalastrum fugaceum, commonly known as the fleeting starflower, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that bloom briefly during the early morning. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapting to the harsh conditions of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, Megalastrum fugaceum is considered a rare and endangered species."
