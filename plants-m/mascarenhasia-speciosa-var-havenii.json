    "intro": "Mascarenhasia speciosa var. havenii, commonly known as the Mascarene star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive star-shaped pattern on the petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in coastal forests or on rocky outcrops. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
