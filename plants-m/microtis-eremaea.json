    "intro": "Microtis eremaea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that resemble those of orchids, though it is not a true orchid. The plant typically grows in sandy soils and is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Microtis eremaea is considered threatened and requires careful protection."
