It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and along stream banks. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a smooth or slightly toothed margin. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often clustered in dense inflorescences, and are typically greenish-white in color. Monechma depauperatum is known for its low-growing habit and is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora."
