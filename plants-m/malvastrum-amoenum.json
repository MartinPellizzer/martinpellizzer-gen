It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, pink to lavender flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a desirable addition to native plant gardens."
