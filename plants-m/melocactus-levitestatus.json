    "intro": "Melocactus levitestatus, commonly known as the Mexican apple cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, spherical shape and a spiny, segmented stem that resembles an apple. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The cactus is also notable for its slow growth rate and ability to thrive in well-draining soil."
