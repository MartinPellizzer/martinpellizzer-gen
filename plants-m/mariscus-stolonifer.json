    "intro": "Mariscus stolonifer, commonly known as the creeping marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its stoloniferous growth habit, producing horizontal stems that root at the nodes and form dense mats. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, violet-blue flowers in late summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its ecological importance and aesthetic value, it is protected in many regions."
