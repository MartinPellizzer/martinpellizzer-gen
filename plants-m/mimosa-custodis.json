    "intro": "Mimosa custodis, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellow, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and full sunlight. Its unique sensitivity to touch makes it a popular specimen plant in botanical gardens and homes."
