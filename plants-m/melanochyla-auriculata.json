    "intro": "Melanochyla auriculata, commonly known as the golden ear cactus, is a succulent plant native to South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are often covered in a thick, waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically borne at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are reduced to small, spiny structures, typical of many cacti. Melanochyla auriculata is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
