    "intro": "Medica ciliaris, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces toxic berries that are often used in traditional medicine, though they contain harmful compounds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care."
