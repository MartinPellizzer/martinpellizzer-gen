    "intro": "Muhlenbergia pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the United States, particularly in the southeastern region. It typically grows in open woodlands and prairies, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale blue to purple flower clusters during the summer months. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a desirable choice for native gardens. Muhlenbergia pauciflora is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining biodiversity."
