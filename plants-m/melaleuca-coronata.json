    "intro": "Melaleuca coronata, commonly known as the coastal melaleuca, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy or saline soils, often near the coast. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pink, which bloom in winter and early spring. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Melaleuca coronata is adapted to withstand salt spray and is often used in coastal landscaping for its resilience and ornamental value."
