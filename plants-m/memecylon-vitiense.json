    "intro": "Memecylon vitiense, commonly known as the Vitiense Memecylon, is a tropical shrub native to the Pacific Islands, including Fiji and Samoa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
