    "intro": "Microtoena maireana, commonly known as the Maire's microtoena, is a small, herbaceous plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Podostemaceae and is characterized by its delicate, creeping stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in wetlands. Its flowers are tiny and clustered, producing a modest amount of nectar to attract insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
