    "intro": "Melicope macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited melicope, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rutaceae. It is native to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, where it thrives in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. Its fragrant flowers are typically white or yellow and are followed by large, fleshy berries that contain the seeds. Melicope macrocarpa plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food for various bird and insect species."
