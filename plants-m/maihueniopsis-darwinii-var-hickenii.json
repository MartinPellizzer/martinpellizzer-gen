    "intro": "Maihueniopsis darwinii var. hickenii, commonly known as the Darwin's mayflower, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically green with a slight waxy coating, adapted to the harsh, high-altitude environment. The plant produces clusters of delicate, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It is well-suited to rocky soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade. Its unique morphology and resilience make it a notable species in alpine botanical studies."
