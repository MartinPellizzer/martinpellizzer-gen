    "intro": "Miconia aliquantula, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it can become a problematic weed in certain regions."
