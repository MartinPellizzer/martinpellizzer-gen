    "intro": "Melaleuca endlicheriana, commonly known as the narrow-leaf paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia, particularly Queensland and New South Wales, where it typically grows in coastal heathlands and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery bloom. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, and typically appear in shades of white or pale yellow. The tree is valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental appeal."
