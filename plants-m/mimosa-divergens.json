    "intro": "Mimosa divergens, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer seasons. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil, making it useful in erosion control. Mimosa divergens thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
