    "intro": "Marina crenulata, commonly known as the coastal cress, is a flowering plant native to the rocky shores of the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, bright yellow flowers and pinnately lobed leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in intertidal zones. Marina crenulata is a hardy, perennial species that plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas make it an important pioneer species in coastal environments."
