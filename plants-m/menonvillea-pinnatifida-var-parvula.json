    "intro": "Menonvillea pinnatifida var. parvula, commonly known as the small-leaved menonvillea, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It features narrow, elongated leaves that are pinnately divided, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by oval, berry-like fruits. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in horticulture."
