    "intro": "Martinieria arborea, commonly known as the tree of heaven, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces woody capsules that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland forests. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both ecologically significant and sometimes invasive."
