    "intro": "Maerua sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the African glorybower, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical, woody stems that are often covered with a thick, pale coating. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its leaves are usually small, opposite, and sometimes covered with fine hairs. Maerua sphaerocarpa is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder for livestock."
