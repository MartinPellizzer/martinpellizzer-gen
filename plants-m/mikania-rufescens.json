    "intro": "Mikania rufescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a vigorous climbing vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Mikania rufescens thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a valuable ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in some areas."
