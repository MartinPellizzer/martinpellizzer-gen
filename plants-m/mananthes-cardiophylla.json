    "intro": "Mananthes cardiophylla, commonly known as the heartleaf mananthes, is a rare flowering plant native to the humid tropical regions of Central America. It is characterized by its striking heart-shaped leaves, which are typically a deep green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in dense undergrowth of tropical forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
