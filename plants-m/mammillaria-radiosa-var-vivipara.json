    "intro": "Mammillaria radiosa var. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous nipple cactus, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to Mexico. It features dense, cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly hairs and prominent, rounded tubercles. The plant produces pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. One of its notable characteristics is viviparity, where offspring develop on the mother plant's stems before detaching. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for succulent enthusiasts."
