    "intro": "Miconia floccosa, commonly known as the woolly miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in dense, white, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom throughout the year, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain regions."
