    "intro": "Microsideros, commonly known as the beach morning glory, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. These plants are typically found in coastal areas, where they thrive in sandy or rocky soils. They are characterized by their climbing habit and showy blue or violet flowers that bloom in the early morning. The leaves are usually alternate and have a palmate or trifoliate structure. Microsideros species are also notable for their ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in their native habitats."
