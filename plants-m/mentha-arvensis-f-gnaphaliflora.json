It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and small, pale purple flowers that bloom in summer. This plant is typically found in moist, grassy areas and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. It has a strong, aromatic scent and is often used in herbal remedies. Its botanical features make it distinct from other mint species, particularly in leaf morphology and flowering habits."
