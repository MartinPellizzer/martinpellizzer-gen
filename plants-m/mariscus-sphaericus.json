    "intro": "Mariscus sphaericus, commonly known as the globe cress, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spherical, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its root system is shallow and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. Mariscus sphaericus is often found growing in rocky or gravelly areas, where it forms dense mats."
