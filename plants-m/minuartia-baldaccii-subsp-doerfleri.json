    "intro": "Minuartia baldaccii subsp. doerfleri, commonly known as the Rock Spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and features small, fleshy, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. Its leaves are usually opposite and covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This subspecies is notable for its resilience to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry, sunny areas."
