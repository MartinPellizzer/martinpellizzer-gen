    "intro": "Microlepia marginata var. intramarginalis, commonly known as the narrow-margin microlepia, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered along the margins of the fronds. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaf margins compared to the typical form of Microlepia marginata."
