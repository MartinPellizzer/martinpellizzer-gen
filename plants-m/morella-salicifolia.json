    "intro": "Morella salicifolia, commonly known as the yellow-leafed wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that turn a striking yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into dark blue berries, which are an important food source for wildlife. Its aromatic leaves and branches are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of aromatic oils. Morella salicifolia thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
