    "intro": "Mentha polyanthetica, commonly known as the sweet flag or sweet mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often aromatic. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Mentha polyanthetica is often found in wet habitats such as marshes, riverbanks, and damp woodlands. Its essential oils contain menthol and other compounds, making it useful in traditional medicine and aromatherapy."
