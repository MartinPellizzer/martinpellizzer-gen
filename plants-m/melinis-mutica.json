    "intro": "Melinis mutica, commonly known as buffelgrass, is a perennial grass native to Africa, South America, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in warm, dry climates and is often found in disturbed soils and grasslands. Due to its aggressive growth, it has become an invasive species in many regions, particularly in the southwestern United States."
