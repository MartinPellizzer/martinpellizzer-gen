    "intro": "Myrica undulata, commonly known as the wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its narrow, waxy leaves that are often grayish-white on the underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by dark blue berries that are edible for some birds and mammals. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. Myrica undulata is also valued for its aromatic wood and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
