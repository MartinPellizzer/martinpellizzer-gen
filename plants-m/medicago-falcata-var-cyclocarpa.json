    "intro": "Medicago falcata var. cyclocarpa, commonly known as the curled medic, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive curled, spiraled leaves that give it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by cylindrical, pod-like fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
