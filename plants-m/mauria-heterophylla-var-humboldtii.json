    "intro": "Mauria heterophylla var. humboldtii, commonly known as the Humboldt's mauvebush, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly in regions of Chile and Argentina. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, violet-colored flowers. The species exhibits heterophylly, meaning it has two different leaf forms depending on environmental conditions, with juvenile leaves being larger and more lobed than mature ones. This plant thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils and saline conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
