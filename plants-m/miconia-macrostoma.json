    "intro": "Miconia macrostoma, commonly known as the giant miconia, is a large tropical tree native to the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, glossy leaves and showy, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces large, spherical fruits that contain numerous seeds. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense canopies in its natural habitat. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a problematic species in certain regions."
