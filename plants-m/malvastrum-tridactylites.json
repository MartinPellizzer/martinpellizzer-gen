It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or dry soils, often found in coastal areas. The plant features showy, pale pink to lavender flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with three distinct lobes, giving it its common name. The plant is characterized by its fibrous roots and hairy stems, which help it adapt to arid environments."
