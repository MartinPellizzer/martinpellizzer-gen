    "intro": "Muhlenbergia setosa, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and tufted growth habit, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle floral display. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. Muhlenbergia setosa is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in dry, disturbed areas."
