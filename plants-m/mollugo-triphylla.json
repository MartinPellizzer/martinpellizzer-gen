    "intro": "Mollugo triphylla, commonly known as swamp milkweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in damp conditions. It is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical structure supports its role in wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
