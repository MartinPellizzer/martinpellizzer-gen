    "intro": "Mentha caerulescens, commonly known as blue mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically a striking blue-green color. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Mentha caerulescens is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and mild, mint-like fragrance."
