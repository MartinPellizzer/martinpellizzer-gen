    "intro": "Mammillaria hertrichiana, commonly known as the Hertrichiana bunny ear cactus, is a small, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a compact, rounded stem with radial spines and a dense covering of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts."
