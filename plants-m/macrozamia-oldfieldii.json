    "intro": "Macrozamia oldfieldii, commonly known as the Oldfield's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being yellow and the female cones green, and it has a very slow growth rate. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Macrozamia oldfieldii is classified as endangered, making it a subject of conservation interest."
