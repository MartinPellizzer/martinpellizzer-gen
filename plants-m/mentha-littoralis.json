    "intro": "Mentha littoralis, commonly known as water mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows, where it thrives in partially shaded to sunny conditions. The plant has square, hairy stems and opposite, serrated leaves that are often aromatic when crushed. Its small, pale blue to purple flowers appear in whorls along the stem, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds. Mentha littoralis is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
