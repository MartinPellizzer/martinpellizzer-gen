    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 alopecuroides var. microdonta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spearmint, is a hybrid mint species characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and aromatic, slightly serrated foliage. It typically grows in temperate regions and prefers moist, well-drained soils in partial to full sun. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pale blue to purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often used in herbal teas and culinary applications due to its refreshing menthol scent. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a range of garden conditions."
