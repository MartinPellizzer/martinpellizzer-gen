    "intro": "Malaxis pallida, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and small, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows on the bark of trees or in shaded, moist environments, relying on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insect species, and it produces tiny, round seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Malaxis pallida is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
