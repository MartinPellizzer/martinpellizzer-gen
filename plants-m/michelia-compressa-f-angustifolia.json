    "intro": "Michelia compressa f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Michelia, is a variant of the Michelia compressa species, which belongs to the family Monimiaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the spring or early summer. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly China, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a decorative plant in tropical regions."
