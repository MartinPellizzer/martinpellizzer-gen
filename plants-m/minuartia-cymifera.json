    "intro": "Minuartia cymifera, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in rocky and coastal environments. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white. The plant has succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It is often found in regions with high salinity and strong winds, such as coastal cliffs and dunes. Minuartia cymifera plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its harsh habitats."
