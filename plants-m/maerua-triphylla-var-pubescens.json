    "intro": "Maerua triphylla var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy maerua, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are covered in fine, hairy pubescence, providing a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its succulent stems and leaves allow it to store water, making it well adapted to drought conditions. It is often found in rocky soils and is used traditionally for its medicinal properties."
