    "intro": "Melasma strictum var. uninerve, commonly known as the single-veined melasma, is a variant of the melasma genus characterized by its unique vascular structure. This plant exhibits a single, prominent vein running along its leaf blade, distinguishing it from other varieties of melasma. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The leaves are usually broad and glossy, with a deep green coloration. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a subject of study in plant morphology and adaptation to specific ecological niches."
