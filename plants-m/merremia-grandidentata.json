    "intro": "Merremia grandidentata, commonly known as the Florida morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a vigorous climbing vine with heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain environments."
