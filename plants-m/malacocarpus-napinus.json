It is characterized by its slender, upward-curving cones and needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, exhibiting resilience to cold and poor soil conditions. Its reproductive structures, including the distinctive cones, play a vital role in its ecological niche. The species contributes to the biodiversity of its native forests and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
