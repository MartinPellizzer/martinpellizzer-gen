    "intro": "Minuartia tenuifolia var. hybrida, commonly known as the hybrid winter creeper, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, providing dense ground cover. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers in the spring, which are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
