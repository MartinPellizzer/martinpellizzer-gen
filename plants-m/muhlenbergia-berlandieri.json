    "intro": "Muhlenbergia berlandieri, commonly known as the Mexican feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and delicate, feathery plumes that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and low water requirements make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscapes. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
