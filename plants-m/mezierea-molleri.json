It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by elongated pods containing edible, brown seeds. The seeds are rich in nutrients and have been traditionally used in culinary and medicinal applications. Its adaptability to dry climates makes it a resilient plant in arid environments."
