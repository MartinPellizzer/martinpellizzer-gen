It is characterized by its distinctive red-banded patterns on the bark and leaves, which give it a unique visual appeal. This plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in temperate climates. It typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 8 meters. The fruit is edible, though smaller and less sweet compared to common apple varieties."
