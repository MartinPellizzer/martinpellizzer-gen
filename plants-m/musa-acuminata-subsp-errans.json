    "intro": "Musa acuminata subsp. errans, commonly known as the wild banana, is a wild species native to Southeast Asia. It is a herbaceous plant with large, broad, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, green, inedible berries that turn red when ripe. It is closely related to the common banana and is used in breeding programs to improve commercial banana varieties. Its genetic diversity is valuable for developing disease-resistant cultivars."
