    "intro": "Maianthemum gigas var. gigas, commonly known as the giant false lily of the valley, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features grass-like, arching leaves and produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
