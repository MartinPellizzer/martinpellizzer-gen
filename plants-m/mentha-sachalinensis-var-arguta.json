    "intro": "Mentha sachalinensis var. arguta, commonly known as the Sakhalin mint, is a perennial herb native to the Far East, including regions of Russia and Japan. It is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves and flowering spikes that produce small, pale purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along streams. It has a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense mats. Its essential oils, which contain menthol and other compounds, make it valuable in both traditional medicine and commercial applications."
