    "intro": "Medicago schimperiana, commonly known as the desert medic, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters, featuring upright stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by cylindrical seed pods. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with deep taproots and drought-resistant foliage. Medicago schimperiana is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage for wildlife."
