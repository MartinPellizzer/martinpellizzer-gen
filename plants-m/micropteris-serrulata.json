    "intro": "Micropteris serrulata, commonly known as the serrulate water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely serrated fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams, where it attaches itself to rocks or submerged structures. Its rhizomes are often covered in a layer of fine, root-like structures that aid in nutrient absorption. The reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation."
