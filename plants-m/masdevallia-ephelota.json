    "intro": "Masdevallia ephelota, commonly known as the silver-tipped masdevallia, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated petals and sepals that often display a unique silver or white veining. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually small but come in a range of colors, including white, pink, and purple. Masdevallia ephelota is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
