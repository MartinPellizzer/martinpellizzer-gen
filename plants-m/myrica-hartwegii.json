    "intro": "Myrica hartwegii, commonly known as the Hartweg's wax myrtle, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, which consists of narrow, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Myrica hartwegii thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid landscapes. Its aromatic leaves and branches have been used traditionally by Indigenous peoples for various purposes, including medicinal and ceremonial uses."
