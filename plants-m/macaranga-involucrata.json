    "intro": "Macaranga involucrata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or sacred tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are capsules that split open to release seeds with silky hairs. Macaranga involucrata is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its ecological role and traditional uses."
