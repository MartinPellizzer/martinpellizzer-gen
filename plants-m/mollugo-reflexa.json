    "intro": "Mollugo reflexa, commonly known as the sandspurry, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches heights of 5 to 15 centimeters and features prostrate or ascending stems covered in fine, hairy hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with four petals, which bloom in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a waxy coating. Mollugo reflexa is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields."
