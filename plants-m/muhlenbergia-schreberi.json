    "intro": "Muhlenbergia schreberi, commonly known as hairgrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along streambanks. Muhlenbergia schreberi is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
