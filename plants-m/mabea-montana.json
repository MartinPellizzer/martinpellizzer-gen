    "intro": "Mabea montana, commonly known as the mountain mabea, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its erect stem and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, which helps protect it from harsh weather. Mabea montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
