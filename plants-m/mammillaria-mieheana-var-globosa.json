    "intro": "Mammillaria mieheana var. globosa, commonly known as the globular mammillaria, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features dense, white to pale green tubercles that are often covered with fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
