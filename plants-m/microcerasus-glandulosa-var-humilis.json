    "intro": "Microcerasus glandulosa var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf Chinese hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It features small, oval leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces clusters of white flowers in the spring. The plant bears small, red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a hedging plant. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its seasonal display of flowers and berries."
