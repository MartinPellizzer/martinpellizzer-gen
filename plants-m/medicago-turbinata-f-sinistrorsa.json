    "intro": "Medicago turbinata f. sinistrorsa, commonly known as the left-handed clover, is a variant of the common medick, characterized by its distinctive helical twisting of the stems and leaves. This unique morphological feature, known as sinistrorsa, refers to the counterclockwise spiral growth pattern that sets it apart from the typical right-handed form. The plant is a low-growing perennial herb with trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, roadsides, and other open areas. Botanically, it is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
