    "intro": "Mammillaria giselae, commonly known as the Giselae Hedgehog Cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular shape with a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that help reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
