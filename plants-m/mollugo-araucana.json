    "intro": "Mollugo araucana, commonly known as the Araucanian carpetweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South America. It features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces tiny yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor soil conditions and withstand drought. Mollugo araucana is often found in rocky or sandy soils, particularly in coastal or mountainous regions."
