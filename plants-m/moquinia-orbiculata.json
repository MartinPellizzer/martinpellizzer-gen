    "intro": "Moquinia orbiculata, commonly known as the broad-leafed spikerush, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as marshes and ponds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that can dominate wetland vegetation. Moquinia orbiculata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate and improve water quality."
