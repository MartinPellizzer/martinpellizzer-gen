    "intro": "Miconia fulva var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces showy, yellowish-white flowers that are typically clustered in branched inflorescences. Its fruit is a fleshy, red berry that contains numerous small seeds. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
