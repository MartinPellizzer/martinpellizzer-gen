It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, adapting to harsh climatic conditions. Its leaves are usually basal, arranged in a rosette, and its stems are often short and unbranched.
