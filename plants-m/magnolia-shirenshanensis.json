    "intro": "Magnolia shirenshanensis, commonly known as the Sichuan magnolia, is a rare and ancient species native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. It is characterized by its large, showy, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has simple, broad leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. It is typically found in moist, shaded forest environments at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
