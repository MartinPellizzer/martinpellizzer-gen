    "intro": "Miconia radula, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, featuring broad, palmate leaves with a distinctive light green to yellowish color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are edible. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it an invasive species in some regions. The plant is also noted for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage and fruit."
