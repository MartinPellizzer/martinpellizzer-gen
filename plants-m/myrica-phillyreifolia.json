    "intro": "Myrica phillyreifolia, commonly known as the bayberry or sweetgum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and clusters of small, oval leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, inconspicuous green flowers followed by distinctive, spiky, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Myrica phillyreifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
