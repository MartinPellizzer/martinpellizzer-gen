    "intro": "Melaleuca dichroma, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia, where it typically grows in coastal areas and sand dunes. The plant is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels away in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, pale yellow flowers that attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Melaleuca dichroma is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in coastal conditions."
