It features narrow, dark green leaves that are often fragrant and have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers in the spring, which are followed by berries that turn from red to black as they mature. Myrtus silvestris is known for its aromatic properties and is often used in traditional herbal medicine. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
