    "intro": "Mesophlebion echinatum, commonly known as the spiny phlebion, is a rare and specialized plant found in specific microhabitats. It is characterized by its unique leaf structure, which features a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in its often arid environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Its roots are deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Mesophlebion echinatum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
