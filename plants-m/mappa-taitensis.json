    "intro": "Mappa taitensis, commonly known as the Taiti mappa, is a rare flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as under forest canopies. Its leaves are elliptical and have a smooth, waxy texture. Due to habitat loss, Mappa taitensis is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
