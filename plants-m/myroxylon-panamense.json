It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its large, compound leaves and yellowish wood. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its valuable timber, it has been subject to overharvesting and is now considered endangered in some regions."
