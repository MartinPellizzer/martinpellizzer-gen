    "intro": "Milla brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed milla, is a small flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Amaryllidaceae and is characterized by its compact, succulent-like foliage and clusters of pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10-20 centimeters and has a dense, bushy appearance. Its leaves are fleshy and arranged in a rosette, which helps it retain moisture in its harsh environment. Milla brevipes is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in dry conditions."
