    "intro": "Miconia rimalis, commonly known as the white-flowered miconia, is a member of the Melastomataceae family. It is a shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are usually covered in fine, silky hairs. Its flowers are showy, with white petals and prominent red sepals, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
