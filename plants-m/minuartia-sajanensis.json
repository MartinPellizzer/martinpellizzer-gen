    "intro": "Minuartia sajanensis, commonly known as the Sajan sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically has wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, adapted to survive in harsh, rocky environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
