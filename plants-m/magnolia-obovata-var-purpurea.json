    "intro": "Magnolia obovata var. purpurea, commonly known as the Purple Magnolia, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It features large, showy, fragrant flowers that are typically purple or pink in color, appearing before the leaves in early spring. The leaves are broad, ovate, and have a smooth texture, turning yellow in the fall. The bark is gray and becomes fissured with age, adding to its ornamental appeal. This variety is valued for its ornamental value in gardens and as a specimen tree."
