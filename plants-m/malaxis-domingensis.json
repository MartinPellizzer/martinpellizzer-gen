    "intro": "Malaxis domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Caribbean, particularly the Dominican Republic. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient absorption. Malaxis domingensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
