It is characterized by its dense, spreading foliage and showy, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has small, elliptical leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its bark is smooth and often reddish in color. Maerua camporum is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
