It produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a prominent purple or red throat. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and is characterized by its rapid growth habit. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along riverbanks. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds, facilitating its spread in natural habitats."
