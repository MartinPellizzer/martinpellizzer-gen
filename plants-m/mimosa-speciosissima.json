    "intro": "Mimosa speciosissima, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves that rapidly fold when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in warm, sunny environments and requires well-drained soil. Mimosa speciosissima is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and rapid growth habit."
