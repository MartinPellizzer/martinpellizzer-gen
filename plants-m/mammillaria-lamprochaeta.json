It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is often cultivated as a decorative succulent."
