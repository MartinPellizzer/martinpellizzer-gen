    "intro": "Mastixia montana, commonly known as the mountain mastix, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers, followed by distinctive, leathery fruits that contain a single seed. It is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and can tolerate drought conditions. Mastixia montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
