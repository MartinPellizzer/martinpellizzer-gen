    "intro": "Maurandya, commonly known as the \"Chinese bellflower,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Solanaceae. It consists of about 15 species, most of which are native to Asia, particularly China and the Himalayas. These plants are typically herbaceous, with trailing or climbing growth habits, and produce showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, and white. The flowers are often borne in clusters and are pollinated by birds, especially hummingbirds. Maurandya is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
