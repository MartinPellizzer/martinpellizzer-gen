    "intro": "Miconia minuta, commonly known as the small miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the Melastomataceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly found in humid lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its small, palmate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. It is often found in shaded understory environments due to its preference for moist, well-drained soils. Miconia minuta is not widely cultivated but is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
