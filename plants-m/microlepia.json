    "intro": "Microlepia, commonly known as the common sword fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value. Microlepia species are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. They have rhizomes that spread horizontally, allowing them to form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to their reproductive strategy in natural habitats."
