    "intro": "Metathelypteris singalanensis, commonly known as the Singalana water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in forest undergrowth. Its fronds are often arching and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a feature typical of many ferns."
