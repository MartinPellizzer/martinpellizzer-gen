    "intro": "Mammillaria pulvilligera, commonly known as the Woolly Pineapple Cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white spines and short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for collectors and succulent enthusiasts."
