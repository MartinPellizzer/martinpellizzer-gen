    "intro": "Moehringia dasyphylla, commonly known as the hairy leaf sandwort, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has alternate, hairy leaves that are typically linear to oblanceolate in shape, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Moehringia dasyphylla is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and partial shade."
