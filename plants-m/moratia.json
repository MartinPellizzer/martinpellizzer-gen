    "intro": "Moratia, commonly known as the \"sea holly,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Canary Islands, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant features striking blue or violet flowers that resemble holly leaves, giving it its common name. Moratia species are typically shrubs or subshrubs with silvery-gray foliage that reflects sunlight. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are often used in coastal gardens for their hardiness and drought tolerance."
