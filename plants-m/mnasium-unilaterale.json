    "intro": "Mnasium unilaterale, commonly known as the one-sided moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its unique growth pattern, where one side of the thallus is more developed than the other, giving it its common name. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. Its structure consists of a leafy thallus with a central axis and lateral branches. Mnasium unilaterale is often found in temperate regions and plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its habitat."
