    "intro": "Milium sorgo, commonly known as finger millet, is an annual grass species native to Africa and southern Asia. It is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are rich in nutrients, making it a valuable crop for food and animal feed. It thrives in warm climates and requires minimal water, which contributes to its adaptability. Due to its high nutritional value and drought tolerance, it is an important crop in regions with limited agricultural resources."
