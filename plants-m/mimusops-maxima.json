    "intro": "Mimusops maxima, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a tropical tree native to regions of Africa, including Kenya and Tanzania. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, palmate leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The tree produces fragrant, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal forests and riverine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal uses, it is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
