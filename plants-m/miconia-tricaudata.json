    "intro": "Miconia tricaudata, commonly known as the three-tailed miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in dense clusters, followed by bright red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions, though it can become invasive in certain areas."
