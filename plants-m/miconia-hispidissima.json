    "intro": "Miconia hispidissima, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia hispidissima is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of moist, tropical environments. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a problematic species in certain regions."
