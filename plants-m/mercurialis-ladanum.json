    "intro": "Mercurialis ladanum, commonly known as the woolly mercury or sweet mercury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in sunny environments. The plant features hairy, lobed leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature. Mercurialis ladanum is notable for its ability to tolerate harsh conditions and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
