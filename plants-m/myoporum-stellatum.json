    "intro": "Myoporum stellatum, commonly known as the star myoporum, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its adaptability to coastal conditions makes it a hardy plant suitable for erosion control and landscaping. Myoporum stellatum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
