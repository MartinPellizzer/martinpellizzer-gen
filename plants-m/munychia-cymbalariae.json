    "intro": "Munychia cymbalariae, commonly known as the common waterplantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in a rosette and are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, greenish-white flowers are borne in dense, spike-like clusters and bloom in late spring to early summer. Munychia cymbalariae plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians."
