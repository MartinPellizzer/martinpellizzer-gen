    "intro": "Munnozia oxyphylla, commonly known as the narrowleaf muhly, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, pale blue to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. It is drought-tolerant and has a low-growing habit, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. The species plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
