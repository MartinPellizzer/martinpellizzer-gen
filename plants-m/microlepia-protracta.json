    "intro": "Microlepia protracta, commonly known as the slender chain fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a creeping underground stem that produces both roots and new shoots. Its leaves are bipinnate, with small, rounded pinnae that give it a delicate appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
