    "intro": "Microgilia minutiflora, commonly known as the tiny-flowered microgilia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It features delicate, minute flowers that are typically less than 1 millimeter in diameter, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant has slender, hairy stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as under forest canopies, and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its small size and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and understudied species in botanical research."
