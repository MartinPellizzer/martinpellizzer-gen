    "intro": "Mammillaria saxatilis, commonly known as the rock mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, rounded shape and is often covered in white or yellowish spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
