It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine wax layer, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in shaded environments. Marlierea buxifolia is also valued for its air-purifying qualities and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
