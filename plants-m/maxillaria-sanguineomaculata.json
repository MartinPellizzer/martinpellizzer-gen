    "intro": "Maxillaria sanguineomaculata, commonly known as the blood-spotted orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that feature red or pink markings on a white or pale pink background. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical, and it produces racemes of fragrant, butterfly-pollinated flowers. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
