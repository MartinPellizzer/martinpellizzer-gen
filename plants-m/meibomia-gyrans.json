    "intro": "Meibomia gyrans, commonly known as the spiral vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its helically twisted stems that coil around supports as it grows. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white flowers that are clustered in racemes, often accompanied by hairy leaves. Meibomia gyrans is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along streambanks. Its unique spiral growth pattern makes it an interesting subject for botanical study and horticultural display."
