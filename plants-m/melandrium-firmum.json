    "intro": "Melandrium firmum, commonly known as the yellow catchfly, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, hairy stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Melandrium firmum is known for its short growing season and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
