    "intro": "Myosotis palustris var. laxa, commonly known as the loose-flowered water violet, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland habitats in Europe and Asia. It features slender, hairy stems that often lie prostrate or semi-upright, with small, heart-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of delicate, blue or violet flowers with five petals, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in garden settings with suitable water conditions."
