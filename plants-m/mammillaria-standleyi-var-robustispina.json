    "intro": "Mammillaria standleyi var. robustispina, commonly known as the robustispina mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are densely covered with white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on the upper parts of the stems. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun exposure, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its compact size and ornamental appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and collections of succulents."
