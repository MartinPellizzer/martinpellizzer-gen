    "intro": "Macrotomia endochroma, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and its unique, orchid-like flowers that bloom in a striking shade of white or pale pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on air, rain, and debris for sustenance. Its botanical structure includes a short, thick stem and a single, elongated leaf that often curls into a spiral. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a conservation concern."
