    "intro": "Meibomia hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy meibomia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes many ornamental and economically important species. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. It typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Meibomia hirsuta is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in partial shade to full sun conditions."
