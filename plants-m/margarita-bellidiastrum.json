    "intro": "Margarita bellidiastrum, commonly known as the desert lily, is a perennial flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Margarita bellidiastrum is well adapted to hot, sunny conditions and is often found in rocky soils."
