    "intro": "Medicago arborescens, commonly known as the tree clover, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its woody stem and trifoliate leaves, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by small, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Medicago arborescens is often found in rocky or disturbed soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it a valuable plant for soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
