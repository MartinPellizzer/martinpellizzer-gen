    "intro": "Miconia barclayana, commonly known as the Barclay's miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by distinctive, round, orange-red fruits. Miconia barclayana is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it an invasive species in some regions."
