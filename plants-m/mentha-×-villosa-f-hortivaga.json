It is a perennial herb with a square stem and opposite leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically purple or blue, arranged in whorls along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in temperate regions. Due to its aromatic properties, it is sometimes used in herbal teas and traditional medicine."
