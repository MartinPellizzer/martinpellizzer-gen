    "intro": "Machaerium berteronianum, commonly known as the African needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Machaerium berteronianum is often used in erosion control due to its extensive root system and drought tolerance."
