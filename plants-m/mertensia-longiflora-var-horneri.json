    "intro": "Mertensia longiflora var. horneri, commonly known as Horner's long-flowered bluebell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features basal leaves that are typically heart-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring. These flowers are tubular in shape and are adapted for pollination by long-tongued insects such as bumblebees. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats."
