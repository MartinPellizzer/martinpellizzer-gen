    "intro": "Muellerina myrtifolia, commonly known as the coastal muelleria, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in areas with high salinity and strong winds. The plant features small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Muellerina myrtifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in coastal ecosystems."
