    "intro": "Mimosa pueblensis, commonly known as the Pueblo mimosa, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that are often clustered together, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into many small leaflets, which are sensitive to touch and can fold when disturbed. Mimosa pueblensis is adapted to withstand drought and has a deep root system to access water from deeper soil layers."
