    "intro": "Medicago falcata var. adscendens, commonly known as the ascending needlegrass, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and small, trifoliate leaves with a hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by narrow, elongated pods containing several seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its drought tolerance and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
