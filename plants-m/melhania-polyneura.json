    "intro": "Melhania polyneura, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Melhania polyneura is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
