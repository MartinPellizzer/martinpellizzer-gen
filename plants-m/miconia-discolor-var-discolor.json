    "intro": "Miconia discolor var. discolor, commonly known as the white miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year in warm climates. Its fruits are round, fleshy berries that turn red when mature, containing numerous seeds. Miconia discolor var. discolor is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
