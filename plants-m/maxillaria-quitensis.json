    "intro": "Maxillaria quitensis, commonly known as the Peruvian orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Peru. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure with fleshy leaves. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a yellow or greenish throat. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of the Andean mountains. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
