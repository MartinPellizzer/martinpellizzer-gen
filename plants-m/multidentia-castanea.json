    "intro": "Multidentia castanea, commonly known as the African chestnut, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically divided into several lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by edible, chestnut-like fruits that are encased in a spiny husk. Its bark is rough and fissured, and it often has a woody texture. Multidentia castanea is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
