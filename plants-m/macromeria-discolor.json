    "intro": "Macromeria discolor, commonly known as the pale sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, pale blue or white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats. Its leaves are opposite, linear, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Macromeria discolor is a perennial shrub that blooms from late spring to early summer."
