    "intro": "Micropolypodium nanum, commonly known as the dwarf polypody, is a small epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its rhizomes and absorbing moisture from the air. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the leaves. Micropolypodium nanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, shaded environments."
