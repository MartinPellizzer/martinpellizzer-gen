    "intro": "Melaleuca macrostemon, commonly known as the broad-leaved paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia, where it typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that gives it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a silvery underside. Melaleuca macrostemon produces small, fragrant white flowers that attract nectar-feeding birds and insects."
