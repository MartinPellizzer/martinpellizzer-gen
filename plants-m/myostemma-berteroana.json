    "intro": "Myostemma berteroana, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, tomatoes, and peppers. The plant is characterized by its small, white or purple flowers and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of hair, helping to reduce water loss. Myostemma berteroana is also notable for its berries, which are edible but have a bitter taste."
