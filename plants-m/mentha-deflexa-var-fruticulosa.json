    "intro": "Mentha deflexa var. fruticulosa, commonly known as creeping mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features a sprawling growth habit with prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The leaves are lance-shaped, slightly hairy, and have a strong minty aroma. It produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. This variety is well adapted to moist soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and shaded woodland areas."
