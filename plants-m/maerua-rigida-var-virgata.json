    "intro": "Maerua rigida var. virgata, commonly known as the slender maerua, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, often spiny leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant is adapted to thrive in poor soils and can withstand high temperatures and limited water availability. Its structure typically includes multiple stems that grow close to the ground, forming a dense, low-growing plant. The species is often used in traditional medicine and for erosion control in degraded landscapes."
