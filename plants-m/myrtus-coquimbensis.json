    "intro": "Myrtus coquimbensis, commonly known as the Atacama myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the arid regions of Chile. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is well adapted to extreme drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in the hyper-arid environment of the Atacama Desert. Its leaves contain essential oils, which contribute to its aromatic properties and have been used in traditional medicine. Myrtus coquimbensis plays a significant role in the local ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various desert species."
