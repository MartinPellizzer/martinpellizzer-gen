    "intro": "Mimusops erythroxylon, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and large, elliptical leaves that are often glossy in appearance. The tree produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, elongated fruits containing several seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and rich color, making it a sought-after material in traditional craftsmanship. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its range."
