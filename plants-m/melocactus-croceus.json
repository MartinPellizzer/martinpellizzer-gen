    "intro": "Melocactus croceus, commonly known as the golden melon cactus, is a species native to southern Mexico. It is characterized by its spherical or slightly elongated stem, which is covered in dense, white spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. Melocactus croceus is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its unique appearance and slow growth make it a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts."
