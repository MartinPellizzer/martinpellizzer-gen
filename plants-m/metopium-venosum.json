    "intro": "Metopium venosum, commonly known as the veiny mallow, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots and woody structure make it well adapted to moist, nutrient-rich soils in its natural habitat. Metopium venosum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in some indigenous communities."
