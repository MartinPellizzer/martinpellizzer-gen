    "intro": "Mespilus stipulosa, commonly known as the stipulate medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often pubescent and have stipules at the base of each leaf stalk. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by ornamental, fleshy fruits that mature in autumn. The fruits are typically eaten raw or used in jams and preserves. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
