    "intro": "Muhlenbergia sciurea, commonly known as the silverhair grass, is a perennial grass native to the United States, particularly in the southeastern region. It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray blades that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and along stream banks, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early fall, producing small, spike-like inflorescences. Muhlenbergia sciurea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in natural habitats."
