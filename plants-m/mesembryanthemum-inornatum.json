It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, characterized by its fleshy leaves and flowers adapted to arid environments. The plant features a low-growing, sprawling habit with thick, woolly leaves that store water. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in summer and attracting pollinators like bees. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
