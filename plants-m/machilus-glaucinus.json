    "intro": "Machilus glaucinus, commonly known as the silverleaf machilus, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that often have a bluish or silver-white underside, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, oval-shaped fruits. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Machilus glaucinus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
