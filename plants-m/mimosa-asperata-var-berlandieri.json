    "intro": "Mimosa asperata var. berlandieri, commonly known as the Mexican mimosa, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features compound leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the spring and early summer. It is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system that allows it to survive in drought conditions. The species is also known for its sensitive leaves, which fold shut when touched, a trait that is characteristic of the Mimosa genus."
