    "intro": "Mentha longifolia subsp. typhoides, commonly known as wild mint, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves and small, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodland edges and stream banks. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their cooling and digestive properties. The subspecies is distinguished by its longer leaves and more delicate fragrance compared to other mint species."
