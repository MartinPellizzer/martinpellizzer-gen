It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that range in color from deep green to bluish-gray. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically blooming during the late spring and early summer. Mattia thrives in cool, moist environments and requires partial shade to flourish. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable subject in botanical research and conservation efforts."
