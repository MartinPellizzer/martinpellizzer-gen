    "intro": "Microsorum malabaricum, commonly known as the Indian water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically divided into narrow, serrated segments. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in shaded, muddy substrates. Its rhizomes form dense mats, which help stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for small aquatic organisms. Microsorum malabaricum is popular in aquariums due to its ornamental appearance and ease of care."
