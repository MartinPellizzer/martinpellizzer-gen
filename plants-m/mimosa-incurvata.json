    "intro": "Mimosa incurvata, commonly known as the curling mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant is known for its sensitive leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or scrub habitats. Mimosa incurvata is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems."
