    "intro": "Mondo clavatum, commonly known as the clustered mondo grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a compact, mat-like growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale green flowers in late spring, which are followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in partial to full shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Mondo clavatum is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to suppress weeds in shaded areas."
