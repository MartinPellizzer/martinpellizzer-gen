    "intro": "Mabea uleana, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a waxy coating. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by small, round berries. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species and is protected in several countries."
