    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 verticillata var. speckmoseriana, commonly known as Speckmoser's water mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often grayish-white due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in whorled clusters, typical of the Mentha genus. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. Its aromatic leaves and flowers make it a valuable plant for both ecological and ornamental purposes."
