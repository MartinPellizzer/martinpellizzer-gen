    "intro": "Mimusops salzmannii var. mucronulata, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite and ovate in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by yellowish-orange fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal forests and savanna woodlands. Due to its ornamental value and hard wood, it is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
