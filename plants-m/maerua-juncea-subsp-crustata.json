    "intro": "Maerua juncea subsp. crustata, commonly known as the stone veld or desert thorn, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a whitish waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal spikes, typically blooming during the rainy season. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater. This subspecies is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder for livestock."
