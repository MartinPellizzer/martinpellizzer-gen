    "intro": "Malvastrum palustre, commonly known as swamp mallow, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found along the edges of ponds and marshes. It is a perennial species that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils."
