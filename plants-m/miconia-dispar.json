    "intro": "Miconia dispar, commonly known as the red miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a bright red, fleshy berry that contains numerous small seeds. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, Miconia dispar is considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native range."
