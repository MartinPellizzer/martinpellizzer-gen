    "intro": "Medicago carstiensis subsp. belasicae, commonly known as the Carpathian vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and is adapted to temperate climates. It plays a role in soil stabilization and nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia. This subspecies is of interest in botanical studies for its ecological and potential agricultural value."
