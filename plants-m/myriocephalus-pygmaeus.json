    "intro": "Myriocephalus pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf rock cress, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Its flowers are small and white or pale yellow, often clustered in tight, compact inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
