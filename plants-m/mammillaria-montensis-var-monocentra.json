    "intro": "Mammillaria montensis var. monocentra, commonly known as the single-armed mammillaria, is a compact cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem with a single central areola, from which white to pale yellow flowers emerge during the spring. The plant is characterized by its dense, spiny glochids that cover its body, providing protection against herbivores. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a potted plant. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
