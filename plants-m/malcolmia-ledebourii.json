    "intro": "[WRONG START] Malcolmia ledeburii, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss through transpiration."
