    "intro": "Matisia cordata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Brazilian mullein, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. Matisia cordata is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
