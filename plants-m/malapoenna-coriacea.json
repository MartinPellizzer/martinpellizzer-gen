It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and landscaping."
