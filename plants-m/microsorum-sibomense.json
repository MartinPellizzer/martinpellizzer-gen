    "intro": "Microsorum sibomense, commonly known as the Sibomense Water Fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it forms dense, floating mats. The plant has finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. Its rhizomes spread along the water's surface, anchoring the plant and facilitating vegetative propagation. Microsorum sibomense is valued in aquatic gardening for its ornamental appearance and ability to provide habitat for small aquatic life."
