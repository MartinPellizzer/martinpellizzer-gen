    "intro": "Maxillaria obtusa, commonly known as the blunt maxillaria, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, often greenish-gray pseudobulbs and linear, fleshy leaves. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, with a distinctive lip that is often broader than the other petals. It thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Maxillaria obtusa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
