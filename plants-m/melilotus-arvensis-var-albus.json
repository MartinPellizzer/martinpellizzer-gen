    "intro": "Melilotus arvensis var. albus, commonly known as white melilot, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, branched stems that grow up to 60 cm in height, often with a faintly aromatic scent. The plant produces small, fluffy white or pale yellow flowers arranged in loose spikes, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it is often found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. White melilot is known for its medicinal properties and has been used historically in traditional remedies."
