    "intro": "Mespilodaphne lanata, commonly known as the woolly mespilodaphne, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae. It is characterized by its hairy, or lanate, foliage, which gives it its common name. Native to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia, this plant thrives in tropical rainforest environments. The leaves are typically elliptical and have a fragrant aroma, while the flowers are small and clustered. The fruit is a drupe, often containing a single seed, and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
