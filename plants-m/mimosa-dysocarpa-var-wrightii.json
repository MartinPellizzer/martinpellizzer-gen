It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait known as nyctinasty. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The species is adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
