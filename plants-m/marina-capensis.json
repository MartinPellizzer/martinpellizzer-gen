    "intro": "Marina capensis, commonly known as the Cape marina, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, blue or purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. It is often found growing near the shoreline, where it tolerates salty air and coastal conditions. Marina capensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens along the coast."
