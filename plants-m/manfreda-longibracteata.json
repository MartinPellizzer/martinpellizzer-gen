It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it an interesting addition to rock gardens and arid landscapes."
