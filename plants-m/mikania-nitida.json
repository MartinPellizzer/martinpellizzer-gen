    "intro": "Mikania nitida, commonly known as the silky nightshade, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a climbing vine with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in leaf axils, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. Mikania nitida is often found in disturbed habitats, such as roadsides and forest edges, where it can spread rapidly. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it an invasive species in some areas outside its native range."
