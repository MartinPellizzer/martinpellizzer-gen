    "intro": "Monechma nepetoides, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky and sandy soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Monechma nepetoides is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
