    "intro": "Mazus rugosus, commonly known as rough mazus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Asia. It features prostrate stems covered in fine, hairy texture, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of pink or white, typically blooming in early summer. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a rough, textured surface. Mazus rugosus is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
