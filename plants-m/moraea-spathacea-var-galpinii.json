    "intro": "Moraea spathacea var. galpinii, commonly known as the Galpin's marsh lily, is a striking perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant prefers wet, boggy habitats and is often found in marshy areas along rivers and lakes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
