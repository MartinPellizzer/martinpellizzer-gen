    "intro": "Mezilaurus campaucola, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Fabaceae. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, and its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three leaflets. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. Due to its rarity and the demand for its wood, it is considered an endangered species."
