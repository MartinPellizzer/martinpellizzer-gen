    "intro": "Myosotis refracta subsp. aegagrophila, commonly known as the alpine forget-me-not, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, silky hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
