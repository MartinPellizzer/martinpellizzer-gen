    "intro": "Macaranga porteana, commonly known as the giant paper mulberry, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, with a broad, spreading canopy. The leaves are large, elliptical, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in hot, humid climates. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing structural support and protection against pests. The plant produces small, greenish flowers followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds."
