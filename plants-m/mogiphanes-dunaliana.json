    "intro": "Mogiphanes dunaliana, commonly known as the silverleaf spurge, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that reflects sunlight, reducing water loss in hot climates. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are pollinated by insects. Its latex is toxic and can cause skin irritation, making it a cautionary plant in its habitat. Mogiphanes dunaliana is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in low-nutrient environments."
