    "intro": "Microcos mortehanii, commonly known as the African bluebottle, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal and sandy soils, often found in the Western and Eastern Cape provinces of South Africa. The plant is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and the plant is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments.
