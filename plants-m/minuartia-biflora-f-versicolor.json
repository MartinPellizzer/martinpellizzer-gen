    "intro": "Minuartia biflora f. versicolor, commonly known as the variable sand-verbena, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Its leaves are usually opposite and linear, and the stems are prostrate, allowing it to spread across the ground. The variability in flower color makes it a distinctive and visually appealing species within its ecological niche."
