    "intro": "Microstylis pichinchae, commonly known as the Ecuadorian grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to the Andean regions of Ecuador and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green to reddish in color. Microstylis pichinchae is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species within its native range."
