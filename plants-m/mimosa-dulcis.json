    "intro": "Mimosa dulcis, commonly known as the sweet mimosa, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and pink to white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is notable for its sensitive leaves, which fold shut when touched, a trait known as thigmonastic response. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens. The plant is also valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
