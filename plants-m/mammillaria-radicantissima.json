It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its compact size and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
