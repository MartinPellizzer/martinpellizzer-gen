    "intro": "Microstylis atrata, commonly known as the black-stemmed feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, dark green leaves and distinctive, fluffy seed heads that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, poorly drained soils. Its flowering stems are often tinged with a dark color, giving it its common name. Microstylis atrata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
