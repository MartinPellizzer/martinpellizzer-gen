    "intro": "Mentha diffusa, commonly known as field mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often aromatic when crushed. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Mentha diffusa is widely used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb due to its refreshing, menthol-like scent."
