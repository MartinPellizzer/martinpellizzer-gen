    "intro": "Moquilea sclerophylla var. pohliana, commonly known as the Pohliana moquilea, is a shrub native to the arid regions of northern Chile. It is characterized by its small, thick, and leathery leaves, which are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically between September and December. Its woody stems are covered in a dense layer of hair, providing additional protection against intense sunlight and drought. This species is an important component of the local flora and is often found in coastal and desert ecosystems."
