    "intro": "Morawetzia sericata, commonly known as the silky morawetzia, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers. The plant produces vibrant pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Morawetzia sericata is known for its hairy, velvety leaves and stems, which give it its common name. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
