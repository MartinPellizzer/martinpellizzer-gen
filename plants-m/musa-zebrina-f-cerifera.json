    "intro": "Musa zebrina f. cerifera, commonly known as the cerifera banana, is a cultivar of the banana plant known for its distinctive appearance. It features elongated, waxy leaves that are typically a deep green with a silvery sheen, giving it a unique visual appeal. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that eventually develop into elongated, curved fruits. Its fruit is typically smaller than standard bananas and has a slightly tart flavor. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking foliage rather than for consumption."
