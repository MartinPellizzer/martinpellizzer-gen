    "intro": "Malaxis boninensis, commonly known as the Bonin Orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the Bonin Islands. It is a terrestrial orchid with a distinctive inflorescence that bears small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are ovate and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is highly threatened and requires conservation efforts to survive."
