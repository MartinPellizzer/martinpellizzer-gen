    "intro": "Mollugo cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of tiny, white flowers. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and dunes. It is an annual or biennial species, completing its life cycle within one or two growing seasons. Its simple morphology and adaptive traits make it well-suited for harsh environmental conditions."
