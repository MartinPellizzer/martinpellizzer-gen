It is characterized by its closely packed, short, and stout shoots with a smooth, glossy surface. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, becoming more elongated toward the tips. This moss thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on soil, rock, or decaying wood. It is widely distributed across temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticultural settings."
