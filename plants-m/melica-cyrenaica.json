    "intro": "Melica cyrenaica, commonly known as desert brome, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low water availability. Melica cyrenaica is often found in disturbed soils and can be an indicator of dry, sandy habitats."
