    "intro": "Mimosa leucocephala, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, fluffy white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and riverbanks. The species is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a valuable plant in soil restoration efforts."
