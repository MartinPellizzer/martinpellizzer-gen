It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a rough texture, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds.
