    "intro": "Mirbelia aspera, commonly known as the rough mirbelia, is a shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its fruit is a legume pod that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. The rough texture of its stem and leaves gives it its common name, and it is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
