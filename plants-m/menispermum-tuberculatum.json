    "intro": "Menispermum tuberculatum, commonly known as the roughleaf arrowroot, is a climbing shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Menispermaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and alternate, palmately compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by orange-red berries that contain toxic seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or edible purposes."
