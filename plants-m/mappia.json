    "intro": "Mappia, commonly known as the tree of life, is a rare and ancient plant native to the dense rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves and striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a thick, woody trunk with a smooth, bark-like exterior that shimmers under sunlight. Its roots are deeply embedded in the soil, drawing nutrients from the surrounding ecosystem. Mappia is revered for its medicinal properties and is often associated with spiritual significance in local cultures."
