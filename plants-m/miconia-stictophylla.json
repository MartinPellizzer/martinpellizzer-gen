    "intro": "Miconia stictophylla, commonly known as the red-veined miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with prominent red veins, which give it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
