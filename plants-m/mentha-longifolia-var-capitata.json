It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers in terminal clusters, which give it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. Hedge mint is valued for its aromatic leaves and has been used in traditional medicine and culinary applications."
