    "intro": "Moacroton leonis, commonly known as the lion's tail, is a unique plant characterized by its striking, fluffy seed heads that resemble a lion's tail. It is native to the arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in sandy soils and full sun exposure. The plant has a compact, shrub-like growth habit with narrow, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, but the fluffy seed heads are the main ornamental feature. Moacroton leonis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
