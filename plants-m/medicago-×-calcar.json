It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces pods containing several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind and animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Medicago \u00d7 calcar is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and as a forage plant."
