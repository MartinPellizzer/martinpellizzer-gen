    "intro": "Martinezia aculeata, commonly known as the spiny hibiscus, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and spiny leaves, which are covered in fine, short hairs. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Martinezia aculeata is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy plant in regions with low rainfall."
