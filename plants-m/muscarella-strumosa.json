    "intro": "Muscarella strumosa, commonly known as the swamp milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in the southeastern United States. It features showy, orange-to-red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting a variety of pollinators such as butterflies and bees. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in swampy habitats. Muscarella strumosa plays an important role in supporting local ecosystems, particularly for the larvae of the monarch butterfly."
