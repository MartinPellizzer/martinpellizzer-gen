    "intro": "Matelea maritima subsp. ganglinosa, commonly known as the sea matelea, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a rough, hairy texture. This species is adapted to salt spray and is often found in dune environments, contributing to coastal vegetation stability."
