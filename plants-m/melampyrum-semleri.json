    "intro": "Melampyrum semleri, commonly known as red bartsia, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its erect, branching stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often found in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Melampyrum semleri is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it can photosynthesize but also derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants."
