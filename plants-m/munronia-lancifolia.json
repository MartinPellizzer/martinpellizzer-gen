    "intro": "Munronia lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved munronia, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in terminal clusters during the spring. These flowers are followed by small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some bird species. Munronia lancifolia is typically found in moist, acidic soils in woodland areas and is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value."
