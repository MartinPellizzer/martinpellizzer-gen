    "intro": "Mariscus karisimbiensis, commonly known as the Karisimbi marshmallow, is a rare flowering plant native to the montane regions of the Virunga Mountains in East Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, adapting it to its often humid and nutrient-poor environment. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom during the wet season. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
