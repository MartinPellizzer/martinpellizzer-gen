    "intro": "Macowania, commonly known as the common mallow, is a flowering plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, velvety leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that typically range in color from pink to purple. The plant is native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Macowania is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas. Its fibrous stems and hairy leaves are adaptations that help it retain moisture and withstand environmental stress."
