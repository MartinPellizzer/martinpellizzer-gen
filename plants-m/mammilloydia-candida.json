It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and succulent collections."
