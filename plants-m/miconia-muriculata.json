    "intro": "Miconia muriculata, commonly known as the roughleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in stiff, bristly hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by distinctive, spiny fruits. Miconia muriculata is known for its rapid growth and can become invasive in certain regions. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
