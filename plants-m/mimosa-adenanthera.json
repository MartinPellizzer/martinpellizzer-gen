    "intro": "Mimosa adenanthera, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, ball-shaped flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in dry, open habitats. Mimosa adenanthera is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in soil enrichment and reforestation efforts."
