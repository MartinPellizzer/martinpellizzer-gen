    "intro": "Mentha viridis var. spadana, commonly known as spadane mint, is a variant of the green mint species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers arranged in whorls along the stem, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Spadane mint is valued for its aromatic leaves and is sometimes used in herbal teas and culinary applications."
