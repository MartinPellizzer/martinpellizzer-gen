    "intro": "Mandragora caulescens subsp. brevicalyx, commonly known as the short-lobed mandrake, is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae). It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plant is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are alternate and have a distinctive, lobed shape, while its fruit is a capsule that contains numerous small, kidney-shaped seeds. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in cultivation and is primarily found in its natural habitat."
