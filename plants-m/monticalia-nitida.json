It features narrow, leathery leaves that are densely covered in fine white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, spherical fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Monticalia nitida is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant due to its ornamental foliage."
