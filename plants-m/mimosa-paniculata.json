    "intro": "Mimosa paniculata, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in panicles, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rapid growth and adaptability contribute to its use in landscaping and erosion control."
