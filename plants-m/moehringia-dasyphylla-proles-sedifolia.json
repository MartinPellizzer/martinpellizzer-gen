    "intro": "Moehringia dasyphylla proles sedifolia, commonly known as the woolly moehringia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early spring. Its leaves are often described as being sedifolia, meaning they are arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps the plant retain moisture. This species is adapted to rocky and alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun."
