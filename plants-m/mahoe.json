    "intro": "Mahoe, commonly known as *Hibiscus tiliaceus*, is a tropical tree native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The tree produces woody capsules containing numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Mahoe is valued for its strong, lightweight wood, which is used in construction and boat building. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common species in coastal and mangrove ecosystems."
