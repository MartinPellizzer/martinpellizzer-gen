It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in a fine, smooth texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy underside, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Mattia laevigata thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
