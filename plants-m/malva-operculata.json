    "intro": "Malva operculata, commonly known as the common mallow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features broad, lobed leaves with a velvety texture and produces showy, pink or purple flowers with five petals. The plant is characterized by its distinctive seed capsules, which split open to release small, fluffy seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. Malva operculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its mucilage-rich leaves."
