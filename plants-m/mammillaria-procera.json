It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, round fruits. Its spines are typically white to yellow and can be quite numerous. Mammillaria procera is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
