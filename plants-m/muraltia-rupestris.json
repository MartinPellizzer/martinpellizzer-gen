    "intro": "Muraltia rupestris, commonly known as the rock mulberry, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Canary Islands. It typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, adapting well to poor soil conditions and high salinity. The plant features small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a slight waxy coating. It produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by edible, black berries. Muraltia rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh environments."
