    "intro": "Melica lanuginosa, commonly known as the downy melic, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense clumps. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as along stream banks and in meadows. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. Melica lanuginosa is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various insects."
