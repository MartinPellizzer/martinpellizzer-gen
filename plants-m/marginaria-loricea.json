    "intro": "Marginaria loricea, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Marginaria loricea is adapted to survive in harsh environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
