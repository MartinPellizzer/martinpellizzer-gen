    "intro": "Mimosa rudis f. latifoliolata, commonly known as the broad-leafed mimosa, is a variant of the Mimosa rudis species, characterized by its broader and more robust foliage compared to the typical form. It is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions, featuring compound leaves that are often divided into numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces fluffy, yellow-pink flower heads that appear in response to touch, a trait known as thigmonastic movement. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden landscapes in suitable climates."
