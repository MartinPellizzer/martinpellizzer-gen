It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that have a strong, mint-like fragrance. Its flowers are small, tubular, and clustered in whorls, often blooming in shades of purple or violet. Mentha cacosma is often used in traditional medicine for its purported cooling and digestive properties."
