    "intro": "Machaerium reticulatum, commonly known as the net-veined machaerium, is a perennial leguminous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves with a distinctive net-like venation pattern. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often arranged in racemes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in savannas and woodland edges. Machaerium reticulatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
