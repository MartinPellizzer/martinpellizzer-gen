It is characterized by its delicate, willow-like leaves that have a distinctive toothed margin, giving it its specific epithet \"denticulata.\" The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. This variant is closely related to other species in the Mollinedia genus, which are part of the Polygonaceae family."
