    "intro": "Mimulus roseus var. glabrior, commonly known as the smooth-flowered yellow monkeyflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features striking, bright yellow, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows to a height of 12 to 24 inches, with lance-shaped, toothed leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and wildflower meadows. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant color and ecological benefits to local pollinator populations."
