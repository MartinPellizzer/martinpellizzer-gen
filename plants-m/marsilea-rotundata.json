    "intro": "Marsilea rotundata, commonly known as water clover, is a small aquatic fern that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. It has four small, rounded leaves arranged in a whorl, giving it a clover-like appearance. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are followed by dark, bladder-like fruits containing minute seeds. Marsilea rotundata is often found in ponds, ditches, and wetlands, where it plays a role in stabilizing sediment and providing habitat for aquatic organisms. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both sexual and asexual reproduction make it a common and persistent species in freshwater ecosystems."
