    "intro": "Melicope melanophloia, commonly known as the black phloem melicope, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the tropical rainforests of northeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dark, aromatic bark and elliptical, glossy leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by dark, fleshy fruits that are an important food source for native wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and lowland rainforest areas. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a notable species in the Melicope genus."
