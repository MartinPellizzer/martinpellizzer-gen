    "intro": "Menispermum carolinum, commonly known as Carolina arrowroot, is a perennial flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Menispermaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that help it ascend trees and shrubs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are large, palmately lobed, and have a distinctive, waxy texture. The plant is often found in moist woodlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
