    "intro": "Manglietia pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved manglietia, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its wood is highly valued for its strength and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in traditional crafts and construction. The species is also noted for its slow growth and preference for humid, shaded environments in its natural habitat."
