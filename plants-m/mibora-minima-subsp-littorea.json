    "intro": "Mibora minima subsp. littorea, commonly known as the coastal mibora, is a small shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, aromatic leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
