    "intro": "Maerua vitis-idaeifolia, commonly known as the African sandthorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Capparaceae, which includes plants characterized by their small, often fragrant flowers. The plant has small, green leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange and are clustered in small racemes. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hard seeds."
