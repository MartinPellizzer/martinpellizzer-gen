    "intro": "Melinis repens, commonly known as white bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. It has fine, hairless leaves that are often folded in a V-shape, and it spreads through both rhizomes and seeds. Melinis repens plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
