It belongs to the Lamiaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, serrated leaves and small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and culinary applications due to their menthol-like fragrance. The variety is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the more widely known Mentha longifolia."
