    "intro": "Machaerium acutifolium var. enneandrum, commonly known as the nine-leaf machaerium, is a perennial legume native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate or pinnate leaves, with the varietal name referring to its distinctive nine-leaf arrangement. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often followed by small, bean-like pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or disturbed areas. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential ecological benefits in supporting pollinators."
