    "intro": "Malva minoricensis, commonly known as the Minorca mallow, is a flowering plant native to the Balearic Islands, particularly Minorca. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils. The plant features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes and produces showy, pink or purple flowers in the summer months. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes other mallow species. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species, often found in specific microhabitats."
