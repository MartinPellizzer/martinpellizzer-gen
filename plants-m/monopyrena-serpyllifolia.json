    "intro": "Monopyrena serpyllifolia, commonly known as common bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length, with a bluish-green coloration. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and horticultural settings."
