It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its narrow, spiky leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions.

Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
