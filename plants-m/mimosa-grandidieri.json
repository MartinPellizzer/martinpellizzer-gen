    "intro": "Mimosa grandidieri, commonly known as the Madagascar mimosa, is a unique plant native to the island of Madagascar. It is a shrub characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within its cells. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate to flourish. Due to its restricted habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, Mimosa grandidieri is considered an endangered species."
