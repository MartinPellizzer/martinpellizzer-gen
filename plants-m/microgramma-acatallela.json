    "intro": "Microgramma acatallela, commonly known as the silver lace fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are typically grayish-white in color due to the presence of fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in shady, humid environments and is often found in moist, well-drained soil. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense mats or small colonies. Microgramma acatallela is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
