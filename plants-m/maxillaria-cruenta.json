    "intro": "Maxillaria cruenta, commonly known as the blood orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety red petals and a contrasting white lip, which give it its dramatic appearance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in clusters and are often fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. The botanical features of Maxillaria cruenta make it a popular choice for both ornamental gardening and botanical study."
