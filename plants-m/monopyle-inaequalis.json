    "intro": "Monopyle inaequalis, commonly known as the unequal monopyle, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its leaves are typically elliptical with serrated edges. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within its family."
