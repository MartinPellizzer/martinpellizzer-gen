    "intro": "Megastachya boryana, commonly known as the Boryan goldenrod, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy or rocky soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Megastachya boryana plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine and tundra ecosystems."
