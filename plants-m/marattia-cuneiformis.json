    "intro": "Marattia cuneiformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Marattia cuneiformis plays a role in maintaining aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
