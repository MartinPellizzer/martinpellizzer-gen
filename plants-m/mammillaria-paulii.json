    "intro": "Mammillaria paulii, commonly known as the Pauli's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a dense covering of white spines and a few yellowish to reddish flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 5-10 centimeters and has a compact, rounded shape. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-draining soil with plenty of sunlight. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
