    "intro": "Melanthium dispersum, commonly known as the scattered milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to local biodiversity. The plant's seeds are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across open habitats."
