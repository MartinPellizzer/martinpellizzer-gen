    "intro": "Matteuccia struthiopteris subsp. sinuata, commonly known as the sinuous shield fern, is a fern species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are typically divided into smaller, lobed segments. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile leaves appearing in the second year. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
