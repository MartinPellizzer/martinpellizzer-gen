    "intro": "Melicope waialealae, commonly known as the Hawaiian melicope, is an endemic shrub or small tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as mesic forests and rocky areas. Its fruits are small, berry-like, and contain a single seed, which is dispersed by birds. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, Melicope waialealae is considered endangered and is a focus of conservation efforts in Hawaii."
