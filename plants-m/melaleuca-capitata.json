    "intro": "Melaleuca capitata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bottlebrush, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and spikes of bright red or pink flowers that resemble bottlebrushes. The plant produces small, woody fruits called follicles, which contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy environments. Melaleuca capitata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract native pollinators."
