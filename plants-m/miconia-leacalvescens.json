    "intro": "Miconia leacalvescens, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit, is a tropical shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright yellow-orange berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
