It is a small shrub characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are typically arranged in clusters. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
