    "intro": "Micromeria nubigena var. cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf micromeria, is a perennial shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves that are heart-shaped, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
