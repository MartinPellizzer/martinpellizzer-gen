    "intro": "Myosotis rupestris, commonly known as the rock forget-me-not, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Myosotis rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
