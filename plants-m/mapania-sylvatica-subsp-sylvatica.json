It typically grows to a height of 10\u201325 meters, featuring a broad, rounded crown. The leaves are palmately lobed, with five to seven shallow lobes, and turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and appear in clusters before the leaves emerge in spring. The tree produces samaras, or winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
