It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, spherical fruits containing a single seed. Maytenus cuneifolia is adapted to dry and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in such conditions. Its botanical features make it an important plant in both ecological and medicinal contexts."
