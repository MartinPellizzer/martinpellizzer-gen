    "intro": "Multidentia exserta subsp. exserta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mullein, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features upright, hairy stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, and its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers in clusters at the top of the stem, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. This subspecies is often used in traditional medicine for its potential respiratory benefits."
