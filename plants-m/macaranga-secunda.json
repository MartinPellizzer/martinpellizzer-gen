    "intro": "Macaranga secunda, commonly known as the common macaranga, is a fast-growing shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and often hairy leaves that are typically heart-shaped or ovate. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish or yellowish in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Macaranga secunda is often found in disturbed habitats and is known for its ability to colonize degraded soils quickly."
