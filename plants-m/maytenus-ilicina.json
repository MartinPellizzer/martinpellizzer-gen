    "intro": "Maytenus ilicina, commonly known as the creeping mayten, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, though it is more closely related to other Maytenus species. The plant is characterized by its slender, sprawling stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by animals. Maytenus ilicina is adapted to a variety of habitats, including disturbed areas and dry forests, and is often used in traditional medicine."
