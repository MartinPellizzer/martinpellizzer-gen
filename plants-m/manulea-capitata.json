    "intro": "Manulea capitata, commonly known as the golden starburry, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces clusters of bright yellow, star-shaped flowers. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It is adapted to thrive in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a resilient species in desert conditions. The flowers attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance."
