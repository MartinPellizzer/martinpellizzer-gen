It is characterized by its distinctive whorled arrangement of leaves that form a rosette-like structure around the stem. The plant has long, slender, floating leaves that are often used in aquariums due to their aesthetic appeal. It is a perennial species that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Mikaniopsis tanganyikensis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygenation for small aquatic organisms."
