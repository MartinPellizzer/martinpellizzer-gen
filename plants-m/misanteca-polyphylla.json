    "intro": "Misanteca polyphylla, commonly known as the featherleaf yew, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, featuring long, feathery leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Misanteca polyphylla is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
