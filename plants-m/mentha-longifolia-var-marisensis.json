It features aromatic, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers clustered in dense spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for coastal gardens. Its essential oils contain menthol and other compounds, giving it a sharp, cooling scent and making it valuable in aromatherapy and traditional medicine."
