    "intro": "Maxillaria strictissima, commonly known as the rigid maxillaria, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces clusters of fragrant, violet to purple flowers. The plant typically blooms during the dry season, and its flowers have a distinctive, intricate pattern of petals and sepals. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for greenhouse cultivation. Due to its ornamental value, it is often grown for its showy, long-lasting blooms."
