    "intro": "Medicago conica, commonly known as the narrow-leafed clover, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in forage and cover cropping. Its botanical features make it an important plant in ecological and agricultural contexts."
