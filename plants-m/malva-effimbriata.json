    "intro": "Malva effimbriata, commonly known as the African marshmallow, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in wet, marshy environments and is often found near water sources. The hairy stems and fuzzy leaves are adaptations that help it retain moisture in its native habitat."
