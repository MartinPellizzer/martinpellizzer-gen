    "intro": "Mariscus indecorus, commonly known as the ugly marshmallow, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the wetlands of North America. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a powdery waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its moist habitat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pink flowers during the summer months. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils. Despite its unassuming appearance, it plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
