    "intro": "Marsilea crenata, commonly known as water clover, is a aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive four-leaf clover-like appearance, with small, floating leaves that often form a rosette. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. It reproduces through spores, which are released from sporocarps that develop on the underside of its leaves. Marsilea crenata is often used in ornamental water gardens due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to help control algae growth."
