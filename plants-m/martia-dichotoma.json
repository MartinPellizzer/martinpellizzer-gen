    "intro": "Martia dichotoma, commonly known as the two-branched milkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and pairs of opposite leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. It is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system for water absorption. The milky sap it exudes is a distinguishing feature, often used in traditional medicine."
