It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a drought-tolerant species suitable for xeriscaping. Muhlenbergia depauperata is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
