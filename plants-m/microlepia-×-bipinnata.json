    "intro": "Microlepia \u00d7 bipinnata, commonly known as the hybrid fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Microlepia sylvatica and Microlepia tenuifolia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
