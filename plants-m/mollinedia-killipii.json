    "intro": "Mollinedia killipii, commonly known as the Killip's mollinedia, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are compound, with finely divided lobes, and it produces small, white to pale green flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
