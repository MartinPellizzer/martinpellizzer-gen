    "intro": "Mimulus aridus, commonly known as the desert monkeyflower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its bright orange or yellow flowers, which are typically spurred at the back, a feature common in the genus Mimulus. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss. Mimulus aridus plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies in its native habitat."
