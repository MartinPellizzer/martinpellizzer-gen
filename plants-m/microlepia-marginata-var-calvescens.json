    "intro": "Microlepia marginata var. calvescens, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sword fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a serrated margin, often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new shoots, allowing it to spread gradually. The varietal form, calvescens, is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical variety."
