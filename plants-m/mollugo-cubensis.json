    "intro": "Mollugo cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban carpetweed, is a low-growing annual plant native to the Caribbean. It features small, opposite leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in coastal areas and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a common weed in tropical and subtropical regions."
