    "intro": "Masdevallia panamensis, commonly known as the Panamanian masdevallia, is a tropical orchid native to the cloud forests of Panama. It is characterized by its delicate, often brightly colored flowers that bloom on wiry, branching stems. The plant typically grows epiphytically on trees, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are usually narrow and strap-like, adapted to the humid, shaded conditions of its habitat. Masdevallia panamensis is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
