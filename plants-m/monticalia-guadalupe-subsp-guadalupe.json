    "intro": "Monticalia guadalupe subsp. guadalupe, commonly known as Guadalupe monticalia, is a rare shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Mexico. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, followed by small, three-lobed berries. It thrives in humid, coastal climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils near the coast. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
