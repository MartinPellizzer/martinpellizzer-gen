It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is well adapted to sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green fruits that are typically not eaten by humans but are used in traditional medicine. It is native to regions with arid or semi-arid climates, such as parts of Central Asia and the Middle East. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in challenging environmental conditions."
