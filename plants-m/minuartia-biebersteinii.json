    "intro": "Minuartia biebersteinii, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its rosette of small, fleshy, often blue or purple leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers during the short growing season. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous areas. Minuartia biebersteinii is adapted to cold climates and is a common component of tundra and alpine ecosystems."
