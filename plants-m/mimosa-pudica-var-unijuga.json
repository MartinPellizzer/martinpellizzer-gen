    "intro": "Mimosa pudica var. unijuga, commonly known as the sensitive plant or\u5bb3\u7f9e\u8349, is a herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched. Native to South America, it thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its unique response to touch, known as thigmonasty, is a defense mechanism against herbivores. This variety is distinguished by its reduced leaflets and compact growth habit compared to the standard Mimosa pudica."
