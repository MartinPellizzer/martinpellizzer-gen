    "intro": "Monstera kikiae, commonly known as the Kikai monstera, is a rare and unique species of flowering plant native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed leaves that resemble those of the more widely recognized Monstera deliciosa. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by round, green fruits resembling miniature tomatoes. Its foliage is often used in traditional Japanese medicine for its purported health benefits. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, Monstera kikiae is considered an endangered species."
