It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, hairy stems that often form dense clusters, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Its small, pink to purple flowers are arranged in loose clusters, blooming from June to August. It plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and supporting local insect populations."
