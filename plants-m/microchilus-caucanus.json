    "intro": "Microchilus caucanus, commonly known as the Caucasian microchilus, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it blooms during the spring and early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
