    "intro": "Malus pumila var. praecox, commonly known as early apple, is a variety of the apple tree that is characterized by its early fruiting habit. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree, typically growing to a height of 2\u20134 meters. The plant produces small, tart apples that ripen earlier than most other apple varieties, often in late summer. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a serrated edge, and the flowers are white with pinkish tinges. This variety is valued for its hardiness and is often used in ornamental gardening as well as for its edible fruits."
