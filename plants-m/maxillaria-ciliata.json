    "intro": "Maxillaria ciliata, commonly known as the fringed maxillaria, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and linear, dark green leaves. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with a distinctive fringed appearance on the petals. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Maxillaria ciliata is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
