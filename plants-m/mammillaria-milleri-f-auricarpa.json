    "intro": "Mammillaria milleri f. auricarpa, commonly known as the auricarped hedgehog cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines and small, rounded areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its unique feature is the auriculate (ear-shaped) tubercles that give it its common name. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun."
