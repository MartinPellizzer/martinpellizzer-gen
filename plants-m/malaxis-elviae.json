    "intro": "Malaxis elviae, commonly known as the Elvia's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its small, clustered inflorescences produce numerous tiny flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Malaxis elviae is considered a rare and endangered species."
