    "intro": "Menyanthes trifoliata var. minor, commonly known as lesser water-leaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features trifoliate leaves composed of three oval to ovate leaflets, which are typically submerged or floating on the water surface. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. This variety is closely related to the common water-leaf but is distinguished by its smaller size and habitat preferences."
