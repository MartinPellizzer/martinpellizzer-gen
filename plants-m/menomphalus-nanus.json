    "intro": "Menomphalus nanus, commonly known as the dwarf menomphalus, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with slender, hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
