    "intro": "Macaranga involucrata var. involucrata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Indian rubber plant, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits that release tiny seeds. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges due to its rapid growth and adaptability. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its role in local ecosystems."
