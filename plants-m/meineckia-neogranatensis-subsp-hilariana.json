    "intro": "Meineckia neogranatensis subsp. hilariana, commonly known as the Hilarian meineckia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of southern Europe. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves and produces delicate, pale blue or violet flowers during the spring and early summer. Its botanical characteristics are closely related to other members of the Boraginaceae family, which are known for their hairy stems and showy flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
