It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of fragrant, violet-colored flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces intricate, spurred orchid flowers with a unique structure that aids in pollination by specific insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
