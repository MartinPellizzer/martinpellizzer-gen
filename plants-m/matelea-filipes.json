It is a climbing shrub that produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, bean-like pods that contain seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sun. Due to its unique flowering habit and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
