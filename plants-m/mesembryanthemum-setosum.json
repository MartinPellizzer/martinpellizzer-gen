    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum setosum, commonly known as the hairy ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of pink, yellow, and white, typically blooming in spring and summer. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which aids in water retention. Mesembryanthemum setosum is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
