    "intro": "Myosotis \u00d7 microcalyx, commonly known as the hybrid forget-me-not, is a perennial flowering plant that exhibits characteristics of both its parent species, Myosotis sylvatica and Myosotis runcifolia. It typically produces small, blue to violet flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. The plant has heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are slightly hairy, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in woodland areas and along streambanks, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of these habitats. Myosotis \u00d7 microcalyx is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
