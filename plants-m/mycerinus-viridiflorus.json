    "intro": "Mycerinus viridiflorus, commonly known as the green-flowered mycerinus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green. The plant produces striking, pale green flowers with a subtle fragrance, which bloom in late spring. Its botanical significance lies in its unique coloration and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection."
