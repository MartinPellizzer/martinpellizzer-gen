    "intro": "Maranta kerchovei, commonly known as the \"prayer plant,\" is a tropical flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, colorful foliage that often changes with the time of day, a phenomenon known as nyctinasty. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in its natural habitat. Maranta kerchovei is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
