    "intro": "Megistostigma, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its striking, bright yellow bracts that resemble small stars, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Its leaves are usually simple and alternate, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Megistostigma is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
