    "intro": "Memecylon grande var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy memecylon, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its pubescent (hairy) leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as primary forests and along stream banks. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a rough texture due to the dense pubescence. The flowers are usually pink or white, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds."
