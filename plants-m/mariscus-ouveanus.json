    "intro": "Mariscus ouveanus, commonly known as the Ouvean marshmallow, is a unique plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its soft, fleshy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its most distinctive feature is its swollen, spongy stems, which store water and help it survive in arid or seasonally dry environments. Mariscus ouveanus is often found in wetland or marshy habitats, where it plays a role in maintaining local biodiversity."
