    "intro": "Miconia penduliflora, commonly known as the hanging-flower miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that hang from the stems, giving it its common name. These flowers are followed by bright orange or red berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. Miconia penduliflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
