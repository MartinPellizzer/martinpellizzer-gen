    "intro": "Malaxis ventricosa, commonly known as the balloon orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its unique, inflated pseudobulbs that resemble small balloons, which store water and nutrients. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in forests or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a fascinating subject for both horticultural and scientific study."
