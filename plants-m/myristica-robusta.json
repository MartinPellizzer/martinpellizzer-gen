    "intro": "Myristica robusta, commonly known as the nutmeg tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Maluku Islands in Indonesia. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its large, glossy leaves and fragrant flowers. The plant produces both male and female flowers on the same tree, with the female flowers developing into the aromatic seeds used for nutmeg and mace. Its fruits are woody capsules that split open to release the aromatic seeds. The tree thrives in humid, shaded environments and is cultivated for its valuable spice products."
