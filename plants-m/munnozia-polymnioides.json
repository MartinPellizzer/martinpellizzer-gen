It is a perennial herb with a rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that are adapted to arid environments. The plant produces showy, white to pinkish flowers during the spring and summer months. Its roots are deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Munnozia polymnioides is well-suited to rocky and sandy soils, making it a characteristic species of desert ecosystems."
