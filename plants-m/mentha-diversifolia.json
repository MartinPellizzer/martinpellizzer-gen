    "intro": "Mentha diversifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf mint, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy and have a distinct minty aroma. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorled clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, making it a common garden and wild plant. Mentha diversifolia is often used in herbal teas and traditional medicine for its aromatic and cooling properties."
