    "intro": "Mikania hylibates, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its rapid growth and heart-shaped leaves that are typically light green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
