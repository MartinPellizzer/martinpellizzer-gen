It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves with a complex network of veins, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters at the base of the leaves.

Its unique vascular structure and ornamental foliage make it a subject of interest in botanical studies and horticulture."
