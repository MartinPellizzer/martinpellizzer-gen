    "intro": "Myodocarpus vieillardii, commonly known as the African white cedar, is a small evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by woody, spherical fruits that contain one or two seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
