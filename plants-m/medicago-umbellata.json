    "intro": "Medicago umbellata, commonly known as the yellow sweetclover, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in umbel-like clusters. The plant has a deep root system that helps it thrive in a variety of soil types, including those that are dry or disturbed. It is often found in meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields, where it can become invasive in some regions. Medicago umbellata is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
