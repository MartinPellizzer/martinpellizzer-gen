    "intro": "Myoporum betcheanum var. pubescens, commonly known as the coastal myoporum, is a shrub native to coastal areas of New Zealand. It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky shores. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive."
