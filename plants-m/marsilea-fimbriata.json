    "intro": "Marsilea fimbriata, commonly known as water clover, is a aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are divided into four lobes, resembling the shape of a four-leaf clover. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. It produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are borne on short stalks, followed by round, green seeds. Marsilea fimbriata is often used in water gardens and is a popular ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage."
