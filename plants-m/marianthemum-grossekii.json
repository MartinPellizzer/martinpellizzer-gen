    "intro": "Marianthemum grossekii, commonly known as the giant marsh marigold, is a striking plant native to the wetlands of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that can reach up to 10 centimeters in diameter. The plant typically grows in moist, boggy environments and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture. Marianthemum grossekii is a perennial herb that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, making it a dominant feature in its natural habitat."
