    "intro": "Microsorum nigrescens, commonly known as the black sword fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that often develop a bluish or blackish hue when mature. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for aquatic life. Microsorum nigrescens is popular in aquascaping due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of care."
