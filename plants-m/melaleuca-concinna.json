    "intro": "Melaleuca concinna, commonly known as the slender bottlebrush, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and dense, cylindrical inflorescences that resemble bottlebrushes. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers, which are typically clustered in spikes. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in a whitish bloom, giving them a distinctive appearance. Melaleuca concinna is often found in coastal heathlands and sandy soils, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
