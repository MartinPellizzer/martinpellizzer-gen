    "intro": "Malva urticifolia, commonly known as the stinging nettle mallows, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy pink or purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves contain stinging hairs, similar to those of the stinging nettle, which can cause skin irritation upon contact. Malva urticifolia is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties."
