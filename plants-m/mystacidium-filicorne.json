    "intro": "Mystacidium filicorne, commonly known as the fern-like liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble those of a fern, hence its common name. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can absorb moisture through its leaf-like structures. Mystacidium filicorne lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having structures called thallus that serve multiple functions. It plays a role in nutrient cycling and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
