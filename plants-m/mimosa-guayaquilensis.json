    "intro": "Mimosa guayaquilensis, commonly known as the Guayaquil mimosa, is a shrub native to the humid lowland forests of South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response known as thigmonastic movement. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in globular clusters, which are followed by long, slender pods. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in secondary growth areas. Mimosa guayaquilensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
