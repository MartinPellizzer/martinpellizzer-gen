    "intro": "[WRONG START] Mimosa lawrenceana, commonly known as the Lawrence mimosa, is a small, deciduous shrub native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by the plant's sensitive leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid environments. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
