    "intro": "Mimosa magentea, commonly known as the purple mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, showy pink to purple flowers that bloom in spring. It is known for its sensitive leaves that fold when touched, a response called thigmonasty. Mimosa magentea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun."
