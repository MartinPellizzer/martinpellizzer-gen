It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from deep red to orange, often appearing at dawn. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and a waxy surface. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its vibrant blooms."
