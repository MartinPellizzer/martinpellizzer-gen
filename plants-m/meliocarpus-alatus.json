It is characterized by its distinctive, winged fruits that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant has compound leaves with serrated margins and produces small, yellowish flowers. Its hard, durable wood is highly valued for construction and furniture-making. The species is also noted for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it an important pioneer species in degraded landscapes."
