    "intro": "Macropidia, commonly known as the coastal holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are leathery and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Macropidia is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
