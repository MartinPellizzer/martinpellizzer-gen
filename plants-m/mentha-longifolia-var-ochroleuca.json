    "intro": "Mentha longifolia var. ochroleuca, commonly known as sweet cicely, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a delicate, anise-like aroma, which is due to the presence of volatile oils such as anethole. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in herbal medicine."
