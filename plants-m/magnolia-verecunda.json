    "intro": "Magnolia verecunda, commonly known as the white magnolia, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The tree has smooth, gray bark and elongated, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its flowers emit a sweet, intoxicating fragrance, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Magnolia verecunda is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and historical significance in American horticulture."
