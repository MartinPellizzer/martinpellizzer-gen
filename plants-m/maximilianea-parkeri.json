    "intro": "Maximilianea parkeri, commonly known as the yellow bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking yellow, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds. Maximilianea parkeri is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
