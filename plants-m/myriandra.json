    "intro": "Myriandra, commonly known as the Christmas bell, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Myriandra thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and woodland areas."
