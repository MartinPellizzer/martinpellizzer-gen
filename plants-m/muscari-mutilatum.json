    "intro": "Muscari mutilatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved grape hyacinth, is a bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, resembling grapes, hence its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10-15 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, blooming in early spring. Muscari mutilatum is often used in rock gardens and as a border plant due to its compact size and ornamental flowers."
