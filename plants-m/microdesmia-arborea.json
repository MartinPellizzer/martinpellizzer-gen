It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and ixora, and is characterized by its opposite, elliptic leaves with a smooth upper surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters at the leaf axils. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release tiny seeds. Microdesmia arborea is often found in humid, shaded environments within tropical forests."
