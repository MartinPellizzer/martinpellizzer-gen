    "intro": "Menyanthes trifolium, commonly known as marsh sandwort, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are typically trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil in aquatic environments. It is often found in shallow water or damp soil, and it plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various insects and microorganisms."
