    "intro": "Microsorum carinatum, commonly known as the flameheart fern, is a species of water fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds with a prominent midrib and a red-tinged appearance. The plant thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, often found in slow-moving streams and ponds. Its leaves are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments that provide a striking visual contrast in aquariums. Microsorum carinatum is popular among aquascapers for its aesthetic appeal and ease of maintenance."
