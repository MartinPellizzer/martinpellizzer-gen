It is characterized by its slender, silver-blue foliage and delicate, feathery seed heads that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. Its growth habit is clump-forming, with tall, arching stems that add ornamental value to gardens. Muhlenbergia phleoides is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in partial shade."
