    "intro": "Moniera, commonly known as the club mosses, is a group of primitive vascular plants belonging to the order Lephtalioales. These plants are characterized by their small, herbaceous stems and spore-producing structures called strobila. They typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Moniera species have a simple structure with no true leaves, and they reproduce via spores rather than seeds. Their evolutionary significance lies in their role as early land plants and their contribution to understanding plant evolution."
