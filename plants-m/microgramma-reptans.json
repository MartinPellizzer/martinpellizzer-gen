    "intro": "Microgramma reptans, commonly known as the creeping maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or in the understory of forests. Its rhizomes are creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Microgramma reptans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
