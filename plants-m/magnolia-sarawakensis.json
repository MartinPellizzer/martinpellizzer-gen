    "intro": "Magnolia sarawakensis, commonly known as the Sarawak magnolia, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its large, showy, white to pale pink petals that bloom in early spring. The plant has broad, glossy leaves and produces fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland tropical forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
