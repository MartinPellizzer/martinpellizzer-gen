    "intro": "Mammillaria longimamma f. hexacentra, commonly known as the six-armed mammillaria, is a fascinating cactus species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem that is covered in dense, white to pale green tubercles. The plant produces small, white flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on the upper part of the stem. Its compact size and unique appearance make it a popular choice for succulent collections. The variety 'hexacentra' is distinguished by its six prominent radial spines, giving it a distinctive, star-like appearance."
