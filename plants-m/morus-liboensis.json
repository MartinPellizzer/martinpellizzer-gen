It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, featuring a broad, spreading crown. The leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a serrated margin and a hairy underside. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by small, round berries that turn red when mature. This plant is often cultivated for its leaves, which are used in traditional Chinese medicine and as feed for silkworms."
