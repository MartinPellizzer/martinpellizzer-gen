It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and woody stems. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are usually elliptical with a smooth surface, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
