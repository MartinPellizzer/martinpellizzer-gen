    "intro": "Miconia hookeriana, commonly known as the Hawaiian miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its fruit is a bright red, fleshy berry that contains numerous seeds. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions."
