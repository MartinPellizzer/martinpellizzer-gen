    "intro": "Mimosa sicaria, commonly known as the Sicilian mimosa, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, often in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Mimosa sicaria is also known for its sensitive leaves, which fold shut when touched, a trait shared with other members of its genus."
