    "intro": "Mammillaria erectohamata, commonly known as the erect-haired hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem and dense, white spines that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun exposure. Mammillaria erectohamata is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its compact size and ornamental value."
