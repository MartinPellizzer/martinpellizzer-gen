    "intro": "Megalastrum pansamalense, commonly known as the Panam\u00e1 starleaf, is a flowering plant native to the humid lowland forests of Panama. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped leaves and showy, violet-pink flowers. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native region."
