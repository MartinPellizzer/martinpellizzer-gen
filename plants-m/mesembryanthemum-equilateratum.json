It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, which is characterized by its succulent leaves and showy flowers. The plant produces small, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. Its leaves are fleshy and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Mesembryanthemum equilateratum is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
