    "intro": "Modecca paschanthus, commonly known as the Easter lily, is a striking plant native to the Canary Islands. It features showy, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring, often around Easter, hence its common name. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette at the base. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to produce multiple blooms throughout the growing season."
