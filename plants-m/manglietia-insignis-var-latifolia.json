    "intro": "Manglietia insignis var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved manglietia, is a rare and striking tropical plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its large, velvety, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces showy, white to pale pink flowers with a strong, spicy fragrance, which bloom in late spring. It is a member of the Magnoliaceae family, known for its primitive floral structures and ancient lineage. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species requiring conservation efforts."
