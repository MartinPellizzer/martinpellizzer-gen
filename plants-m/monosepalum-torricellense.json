    "intro": "Monosepalum torricellense, commonly known as the Torricella bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive single sepal that encloses the flower bud, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky soils, thriving in cool and moist environments. Its flowers are usually blue or violet, with five petals that open sequentially, a unique feature among its relatives. The species is of interest to botanists due to its specialized adaptations to its alpine habitat."
