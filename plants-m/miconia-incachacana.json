    "intro": "Miconia incachacana, commonly known as the pink miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers, which are followed by distinctive, red, fleshy fruits. It is often found in humid, lowland areas with rich, well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in some regions, though it can be invasive in certain ecosystems."
