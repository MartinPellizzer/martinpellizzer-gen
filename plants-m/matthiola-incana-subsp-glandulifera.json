    "intro": "Matthiola incana subsp. glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its branched, herbaceous stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The subspecies is distinguished by its glandular hairs covering the leaves and stems, which give it a slightly sticky texture. It typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and coastal areas. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has a long history of use in traditional medicine."
