    "intro": "Microlepia \u00d7 intramarginalis, commonly known as the hybrid fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Microlepia miquelii and Microlepia pteropus. It is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a bluish-green hue. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests or rocky crevices, where it thrives in partial shade. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are usually located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
