    "intro": "Malaxis ramirezii, commonly known as the Ramirez's orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, Malaxis ramirezii is considered a species of conservation concern."
