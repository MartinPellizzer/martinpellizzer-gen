    "intro": "Maxillaria rigida, commonly known as the rigid maxillaria, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and features showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically produces pseudobulbs that support its foliage and flowers, and it thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it can grow on other plants without being parasitic. Maxillaria rigida is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
