    "intro": "Masdevallia sernae, commonly known as the \"serpent orchid,\" is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique, often strikingly colored flowers that resemble serpents, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette, while its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture from the air. Masdevallia sernae is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and rarity in cultivation."
