    "intro": "Melaleuca aquilonia subsp. aquilonia, commonly known as the Narrow-leaf Paperbark, is a shrub or small tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a pale, fibrous layer beneath. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in spikes, which are typically followed by cupular, woody fruits. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often in wet or brackish environments. The leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a slight resinous scent."
