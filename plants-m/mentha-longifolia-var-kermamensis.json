    "intro": "Mentha longifolia var. kermamensis, commonly known as Kermamensis mint, is a variant of the long-leaf mint species native to specific regions in Africa. This plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The leaves emit a strong, aromatic scent due to the presence of essential oils, particularly menthol and other terpenes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. This variety is valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of aromatic compounds in perfumery and culinary applications."
