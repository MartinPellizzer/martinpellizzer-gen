    "intro": "Microchilus puyoensis var. puyoensis, commonly known as the Puyo microchilus, is a rare flowering plant native to the equatorial regions of South America. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded understory environments of tropical rainforests. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with prominent stamens and a bilaterally symmetric structure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
