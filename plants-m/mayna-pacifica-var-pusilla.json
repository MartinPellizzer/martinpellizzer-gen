    "intro": "Mayna pacifica var. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf mayna, is a small, herbaceous plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with compact, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, which appear in clusters at the base of the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
