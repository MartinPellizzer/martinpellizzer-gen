    "intro": "Muscari constrictum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved grape hyacinth, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It produces dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, resembling tiny grapes. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its foliage consists of strap-like leaves that emerge in early spring, preceding the flower spikes. Muscari constrictum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to naturalize over time in suitable conditions."
