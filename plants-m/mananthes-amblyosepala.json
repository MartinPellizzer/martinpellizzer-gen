    "intro": "Mananthes amblyosepala, commonly known as the broadleaf waterwheel, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and its striking, showy inflorescences that resemble a waterwheel. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in whorls around a central stem. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its aquatic environment. The botanical features of Mananthes amblyosepala make it an important species for wetland ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical research."
