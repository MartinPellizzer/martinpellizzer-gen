    "intro": "Melandrium album var. crassifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved honesty, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features thick, fleshy leaves that are broader than those of the typical Melandrium album, giving it its varietal name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed sites. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
