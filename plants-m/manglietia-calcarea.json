    "intro": "Manglietia calcarea, commonly known as the limestone manglietia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Magnoliaceae and is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in calcium-rich soils, which is reflected in its scientific name. Its leaves are large, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, while its bark is thick and rough. Manglietia calcarea is considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss and limited distribution."
