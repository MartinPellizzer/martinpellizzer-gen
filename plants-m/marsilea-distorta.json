    "intro": "Marsilea distorta, commonly known as the distorted water clover, is a floating aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, four-leaf clover-like structures that are often distorted or asymmetrical, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are typically submerged, with small, scale-like fronds that aid in photosynthesis. Marsilea distorta plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
