    "intro": "Mettenia globosa subsp. cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf mettenia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the wet season. It typically grows as an understory plant, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, and is often found in association with other rainforest flora. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
