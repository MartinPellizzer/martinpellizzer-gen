    "intro": "Melica ciliata var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that can reach heights of up to 60 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are smooth and hairless. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the tip of each stem, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
