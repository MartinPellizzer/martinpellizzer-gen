    "intro": "Miconia longiracemosa, commonly known as the long raceme miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melastomataceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its large, showy, violet-blue bracts that resemble petals. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a velvety texture. The flowers are small and clustered in long, drooping racemes, which give the plant its common name."
