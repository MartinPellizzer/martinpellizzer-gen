    "intro": "Marginaria ceteracina, commonly known as the lace fern, is a delicate and elegant plant native to tropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its rhizome is fibrous, and it produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sporangia. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
