    "intro": "Marsilea cryptocarpa, commonly known as the water clover, is a small aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its four-leaf clover-like structure, with each leaflet being a small, rounded, floating leaf. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures include tiny, floating spore cases that release spores into the water. Marsilea cryptocarpa plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates."
