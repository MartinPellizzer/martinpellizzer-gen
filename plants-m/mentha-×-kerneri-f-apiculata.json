    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 kerneri f. apiculata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf peppermint, is a hybrid mint species characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves. It is native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant produces small, pale purple flowers that bloom in whorls along the stem, contributing to its ornamental value. Its aromatic leaves contain high concentrations of menthol, making it useful in both culinary and medicinal applications. This variety is often cultivated for its fragrant foliage and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
