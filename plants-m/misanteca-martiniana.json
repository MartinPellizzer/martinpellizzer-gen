It is a herbaceous plant with delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
