    "intro": "Mentha sylvestris subvar. domestica, commonly known as garden mint, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, serrated leaves that are typically dark green and aromatic. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial shade to full sun. Its essential oils, rich in menthol and other compounds, make it valuable for both culinary and medicinal uses."
