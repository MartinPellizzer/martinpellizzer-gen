    "intro": "Malaxis wercklei, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its unique appearance and habitat make it a subject of fascination for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and illegal collection, it is considered endangered in many regions."
