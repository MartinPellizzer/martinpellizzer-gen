    "intro": "Melocactus trigonus, commonly known as the three-armed melon cactus, is a species native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, globular shape and three prominent ribs that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Melocactus trigonus is a slow-growing cactus that requires minimal water and well-draining soil to flourish."
