    "intro": "Melaleuca howeana, commonly known as the Howe's tea tree, is a species native to the wet tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub that typically grows to a height of 5 to 10 meters. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, white or cream-colored flowers that appear in clusters. Its bark is smooth and often peels in thin, papery strips, and it produces small, woody fruits that contain several seeds. Melaleuca howeana is adapted to humid, well-drained soils and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat."
