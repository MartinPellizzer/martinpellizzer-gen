    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 verticillata var. leiomischos, commonly known as narrow-leaf water mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
