    "intro": "Malaxis oreocharis, commonly known as the purple-veined orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spurred flowers that are typically purple or violet in color. The plant has a slender, leafless stem that supports a single or few flowers, which are often arranged in a raceme. Its roots are adapted for epiphytic or terrestrial growth, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and endangered species in its native range."
