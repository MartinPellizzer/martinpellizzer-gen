    "intro": "Menonvillea, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a rare and elusive species native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spiral-shaped leaves that form a tight rosette. The plant produces striking, colorful inflorescences that bloom briefly before withering, making it a sought-after specimen among botanists and plant enthusiasts. Menonvillea thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens."
