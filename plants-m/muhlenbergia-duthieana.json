    "intro": "Muhlenbergia duthieana, commonly known as Duthie's muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the United States, specifically found in Texas and New Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces fluffy, silver-gray seed heads that add ornamental value to landscapes. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant gardens. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that becomes more silvery as the plant matures. Muhlenbergia duthieana is valued for its low maintenance requirements and ability to provide habitat for native wildlife."
