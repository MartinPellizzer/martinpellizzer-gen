    "intro": "Matthiola sinuata var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, four-petaled flowers that come in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, though the variety glabrescens is distinguished by its smoother, hairless foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. This plant is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
