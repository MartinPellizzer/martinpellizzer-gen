It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stem. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments.
