    "intro": "Mentha aquatica var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly water mint, is a perennial herb native to moist, often aquatic environments. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and emit a strong mint aroma when crushed. It produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorled clusters, typically blooming in late summer. This plant thrives in wetlands, stream banks, and other water-saturated habitats."
