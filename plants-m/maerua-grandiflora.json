    "intro": "Maerua grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered maerua, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of showy, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along riverbanks. Maerua grandiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
