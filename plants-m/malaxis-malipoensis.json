    "intro": "Malaxis malipoensis, commonly known as the Malipo orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, often moss-like growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in a spike, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Malaxis malipoensis is valued for its unique appearance and is often sought after by orchid enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its native range."
