    "intro": "Masdevallia militaris, commonly known as the military orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its unique, sword-shaped leaves and intricate, often colorful flower spikes that resemble military uniforms, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments with high light exposure, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its flowers, which bloom in late winter to early spring, are highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts for their beauty and rarity. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Masdevallia militaris is considered endangered in the wild."
