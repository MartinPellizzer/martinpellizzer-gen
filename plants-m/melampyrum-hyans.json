    "intro": "Melampyrum hyans, commonly known as yellow lousewort, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants while also performing photosynthesis. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its flowers are small and yellow, often clustered in dense spikes, and bloom from late spring to early summer. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
