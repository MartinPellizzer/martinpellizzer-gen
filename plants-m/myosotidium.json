    "intro": "Myosotidium, commonly known as the \"blue bell\" or \"lesser forget-me-not,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Boraginaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet, often with a white or yellow throat. Myosotidium species typically grow in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors or stream banks. They have hairy stems and leaves, and their flowers are often clustered in loose inflorescences. The genus includes several species, with Myosotidium hirtum being one of the most well-known."
