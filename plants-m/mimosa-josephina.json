    "intro": "Mimosa josephina, commonly known as the Josephina sensitive plant, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Mimosa josephina is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique movement response."
