    "intro": "Machaonia portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican mahogany, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and evergreen leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss, Machaonia portoricensis is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
