    "intro": "Myristica fatua var. sangowoensis, commonly known as the Sangowo nutmeg, is a rare and less-studied variant of the nutmeg tree native to the Indonesian island of Sangowo. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, reddish-brown seeds that resemble those of the more well-known nutmeg. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and is valued for its unique spice, which is used in traditional medicine and culinary applications. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
