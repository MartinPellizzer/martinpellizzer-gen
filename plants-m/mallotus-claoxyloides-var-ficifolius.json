It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that resemble those of the common fig, hence its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by woody, spherical fruits that are typically not edible for humans. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. The species is valued for its ornamental foliage and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
