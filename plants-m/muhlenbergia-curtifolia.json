    "intro": "Muhlenbergia curtifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf muhlenbergia, is a native grass species of the United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and produces delicate, feathery inflorescences. This plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairie habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas. Muhlenbergia curtifolia is also an important component of native plant communities in its range."
