    "intro": "Matricaria glabra, commonly known as German chamomile, is an annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, branched stems and hairy, alternate leaves that are oval to lance-shaped. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers with white ray florets, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its essential oil, extracted from the flowers, contains compounds like bisabolol and chamazulene, contributing to its medicinal properties. Matricaria glabra thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and herbal cultivation."
