It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Mimosa micracantha is also known for its sensitive leaves that fold when touched, a trait shared with other mimosa species."
