It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and densely arranged along the stems. The plant produces clusters of white to pale pink flowers in late spring, which are followed by small, oval berries. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, forested environments. This variety is noted for its compact growth habit and is valued in native plant gardens for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
