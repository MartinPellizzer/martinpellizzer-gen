    "intro": "Marshallocereus thurberi var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal prickly pear, is a cactus species native to coastal regions of Baja California. It is characterized by its flattened, ribbed stems that are covered in dense, white spines. The plant produces showy yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its ability to store water in its thick stems allows it to survive in arid and semi-arid conditions."
