    "intro": "Mocanera grandiflora, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a striking member of the orchid family native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 centimeters in diameter, often displaying vibrant shades of yellow and orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat, and can reach heights of several meters. Its leaves are long and strap-like, often clustering at the base of the plant. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Mocanera grandiflora is considered an endangered species, making it a subject of conservation interest."
