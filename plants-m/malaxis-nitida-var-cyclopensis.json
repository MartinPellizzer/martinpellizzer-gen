    "intro": "Malaxis nitida var. cyclopensis, commonly known as the cyclopensis orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green in color. The plant thrives in high humidity and indirect light, making it a popular choice for terrariums and shaded greenhouse environments. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution contribute to its status as a sought-after specimen among orchid enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered vulnerable in its native range."
