    "intro": "Malaxis longispica, commonly known as the long-spurred malaxis, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its intricate, spurred flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, with a distinctive elongated spur that holds the nectar. The plant has slender, hairy stems and produces small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in dense forests or on rocky outcrops. Due to its rarity and unique morphology, it is a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts alike."
