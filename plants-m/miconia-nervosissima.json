    "intro": "Miconia nervosissima, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by distinctive, spiny, woody fruits. It is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed habitats. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain regions."
