    "intro": "Malacocarpus callispinus, commonly known as the golden star tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, glossy green foliage and striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a sturdy, straight trunk with a smooth, pale bark that develops fissures with age. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture, while its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a shade tree in tropical regions."
