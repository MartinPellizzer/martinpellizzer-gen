    "intro": "Musa basjoo var. luteola, commonly known as the yellow banana plant, is a variant of the Japanese banana that is prized for its vibrant yellow foliage. It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. The plant produces small, edible bananas, though they are not typically consumed due to their tart flavor. Its leaves are broad and waxy, providing a striking visual appeal in gardens. This variety is also notable for its hardiness and ability to withstand cold temperatures compared to other banana species."
