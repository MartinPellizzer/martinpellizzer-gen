    "intro": "Milium microspermum, commonly known as the small-seeded millet, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds that are often used as a food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, wastelands, and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
