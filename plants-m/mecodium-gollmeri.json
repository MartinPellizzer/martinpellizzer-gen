    "intro": "Mecodium gollmeri, commonly known as the coastal mecodium, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, succulent appearance with thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters during the cooler months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. Due to its unique adaptations, it is considered an important species for coastal biodiversity."
