It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. It has thick, fleshy leaves and stems adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. Merione is often used in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal."
