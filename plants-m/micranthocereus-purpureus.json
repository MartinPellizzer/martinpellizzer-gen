    "intro": "Micranthocereus purpureus, commonly known as the purple night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its columnar stem and clusters of small, pale green to purple flowers that bloom at night. The plant has spiny areoles and produces small, red fruits that are edible. It thrives in arid environments and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic conditions. Its nocturnal blooming habit is an adaptation to avoid daytime heat and attract nocturnal pollinators."
