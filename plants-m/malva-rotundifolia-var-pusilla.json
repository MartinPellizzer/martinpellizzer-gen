    "intro": "Malva rotundifolia var. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf mallows or small-leaved mallow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rounded, lobed leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of only a few inches, making it a compact and ornamental species. It prefers well-drained soils and partial to full sun, often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its fibrous roots and mucilaginous leaves have historically been used in traditional herbal remedies."
