    "intro": "Myosurus minimus var. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed bog mouse-ear, is a small, herbaceous plant native to moist, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. It features tiny, hairy leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length, arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale green flowers during the summer months. It is often found in nutrient-poor soils and thrives in areas with high moisture retention. Due to its delicate nature, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
