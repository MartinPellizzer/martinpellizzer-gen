It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and typically grows on the branches of host trees such as ceiba and mahogany. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces white or yellow flowers that attract insects for pollination. Its berries are usually red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Misanteca costaricensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and contributing to the biodiversity of forested areas."
