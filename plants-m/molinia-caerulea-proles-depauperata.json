    "intro": "Molinia caerulea proles depauperata, commonly known as the poor grass moor grass, is a variant of the common moor grass. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in moist, acidic soils, often found in heathlands and wet meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of spikelets that are often blue-green in color. It is characterized by its reduced inflorescence compared to the typical form of Molinia caerulea. This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its adaptation to specific environmental conditions."
