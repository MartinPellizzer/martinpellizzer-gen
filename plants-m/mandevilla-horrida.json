    "intro": "Mandevilla horrida, commonly known as the rough mandevilla, is a woody vine native to South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and clusters of trumpet-shaped flowers that range from red to orange. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The rough texture of its leaves gives it its common name, and it is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
