    "intro": "Mimosa donnell-smithii, commonly known as the desert mimosa, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by the plant's sensitive leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Mimosa donnell-smmithii is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
