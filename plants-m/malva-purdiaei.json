    "intro": "Malva purdiaei, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers. The plant has hairy, broad leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. It is adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in sandy or rocky soils. Malva purdiaei plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small animals."
