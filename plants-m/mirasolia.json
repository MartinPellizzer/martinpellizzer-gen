    "intro": "Mirasolia, commonly known as the \"starflower,\" is a rare and striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains. It is characterized by its vibrant, star-shaped blooms that range in color from deep purple to bright yellow. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its mountainous habitat. Mirasolia thrives in well-drained soil and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
