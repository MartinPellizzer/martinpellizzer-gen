It belongs to the family Capparaceae and is characterized by its small, inconspicuous flowers and succulent, fleshy leaves. The plant thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments, often found on rocky soils or gravelly ground. Its leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, helping to conserve moisture in harsh conditions. The species is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and has a slow growth rate, making it a resilient component of polar and mountain ecosystems."
