It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and opposite leaves that are typically lance-shaped and have a serrated edge. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found along stream banks and in marshy areas. Mentha aquatica var. incana is valued for its aromatic leaves and has been used historically in herbal remedies."
