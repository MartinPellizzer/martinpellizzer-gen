    "intro": "Miconia coccinea, commonly known as the scarlet miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking red, showy bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers followed by orange to red berries that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
