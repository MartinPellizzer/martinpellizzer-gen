    "intro": "Macdonaldia carnea, commonly known as the pink fairy orchid, is an herbaceous perennial native to the alpine regions of southeastern Australia. It features slender, hairy stems and produces delicate, pinkish-white flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its unique floral structure is adapted for pollination by specific insects, particularly bees. Macdonaldia carnea is a rare and endangered species, making it a focus of conservation efforts in its native habitat."
