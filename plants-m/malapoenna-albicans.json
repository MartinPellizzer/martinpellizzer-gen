    "intro": "Malapoenna albicans, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent petals and sepals, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are small and delicate, often blooming in clusters during the rainy season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Malapoenna albicans is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change."
