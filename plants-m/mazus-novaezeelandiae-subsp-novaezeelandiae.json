    "intro": "Mazus novaezeelandiae subsp. novaezeelandiae, commonly known as the New Zealand mazus, is a low-growing perennial herb native to New Zealand. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve moisture in its native environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of purple or pink, usually clustered in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded areas and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation, it is occasionally grown in gardens in temperate climates."
