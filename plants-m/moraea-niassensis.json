    "intro": "Moraea niassensis, commonly known as the Niassense gladiolus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking, sword-shaped leaves and tall, showy inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowers, which can range in color from white to pink and purple, bloom in spring and are often used in ornamental gardening. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
