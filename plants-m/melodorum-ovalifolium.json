It is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of white or pale yellow. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
