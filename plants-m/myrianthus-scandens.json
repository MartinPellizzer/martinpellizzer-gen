    "intro": "Myrianthus scandens, commonly known as the climbing flame bean, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and South America. It is a woody vine characterized by its compound leaves and showy, red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces elongated, flat pods that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. Its rapid growth habit makes it an effective cover plant in ecological restoration projects. The botanical features of Myrianthus scandens make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable in suitable climates."
