    "intro": "Micropolypodium setosum, commonly known as the hairy polypody, is a small evergreen fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in shaded, humid environments. Its rhizome is short and produces numerous stolons that help in spreading. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
