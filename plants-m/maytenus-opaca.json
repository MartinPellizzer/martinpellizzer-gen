    "intro": "Maytenus opaca, commonly known as the Brazilian mahogany, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It belongs to the family Phyllantaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical in shape with a leathery texture. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy fruits containing several seeds. Due to its economic importance and slow growth rate, Maytenus opaca is often threatened by overharvesting and habitat loss."
