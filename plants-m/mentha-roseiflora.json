It is characterized by its fragrant, narrow leaves that are often pink-tinged on the underside, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate ornamental value. Mentha roseiflora thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its aromatic properties make it a valued plant in both horticulture and traditional herbal medicine."
