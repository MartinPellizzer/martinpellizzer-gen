    "intro": "Mammillaria minima, commonly known as the miniature hedgehog cactus, is a small, compact cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in small, white spines and tubercles. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 5 centimeters, making it one of the smallest species in the Mammillaria genus. It produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. Due to its size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
