    "intro": "Monardella nana subsp. nana, commonly known as dwarf monardella, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically reaches heights of less than 10 inches and features small, narrow leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of bright pink to lavender flowers during the summer months. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for native gardens and ecological restoration projects."
