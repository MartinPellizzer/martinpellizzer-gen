    "intro": "Melochia melissifolia var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved melochia, is a tropical shrub native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which are often surrounded by bracts. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in tropical and subtropical regions."
