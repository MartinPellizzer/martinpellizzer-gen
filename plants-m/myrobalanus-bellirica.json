    "intro": "Myrobalanus bellirica, commonly known as the Indian date palm, is a tropical plant native to the Indian subcontinent. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, with a broad, spreading canopy. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by edible drupes that are similar in appearance to dates. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with long, narrow leaflets that are often used in traditional medicine. The tree is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a shade tree."
