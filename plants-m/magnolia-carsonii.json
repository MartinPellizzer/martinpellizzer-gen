    "intro": "Magnolia carsonii, commonly known as the Carson magnolia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It features large, showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant has simple, alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
