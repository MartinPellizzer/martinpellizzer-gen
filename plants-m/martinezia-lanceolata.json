    "intro": "Martinezia lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf martinezia, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations such as reduced leaf size to minimize water loss. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, providing additional protection against harsh environmental conditions. Martinezia lanceolata is also noted for its pale yellow to orange flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer."
