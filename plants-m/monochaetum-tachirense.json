    "intro": "Monochaetum tachirense, commonly known as the Tachira spikegrass, is a rare grass species native to the Andean region of Venezuela. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and distinctive inflorescence that consists of compact, spike-like clusters of small flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy surface that helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Monochaetum tachirense is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat degradation and climate change."
