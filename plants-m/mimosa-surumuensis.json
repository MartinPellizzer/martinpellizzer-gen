    "intro": "Mimosa surumuensis, commonly known as the Surumu mimosa, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and often nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant is notable for its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by the sensitivity of its leaflets to touch. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in spherical inflorescences. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in humid, tropical environments."
