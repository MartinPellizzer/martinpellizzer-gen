    "intro": "Myrica pusilla, commonly known as dwarf wax myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and have a distinctive aromatic scent when crushed. Myrica pusilla is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in wetland environments."
