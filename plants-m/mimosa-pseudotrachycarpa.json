    "intro": "Mimosa pseudotrachycarpa, commonly known as the rough mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are composed of multiple pairs of small leaflets. The plant produces yellow, fluffy flower heads that appear in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its stems are covered in rough, glandular hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. Mimosa pseudotrachycarpa is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and forest edges."
