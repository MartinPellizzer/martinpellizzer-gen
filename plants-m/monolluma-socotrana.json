    "intro": "Monolluma socotrana, commonly known as Socotra cactus, is a unique plant native to the Arabian island of Socotra. It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny stems and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to the arid climate of its native habitat, with thick, fleshy stems that store water. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores. Monolluma socotrana is a striking example of the island's unique flora, with features that reflect its evolutionary history in a harsh environment."
