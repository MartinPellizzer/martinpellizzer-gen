    "intro": "Mappia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered mappia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom throughout the wet season. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests or along riverbanks. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a slightly rough texture. Mappia parviflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral display."
