    "intro": "Myristica arfakensis, commonly known as the Arfak nutmeg, is a rare tropical tree native to the island of New Guinea. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a spice. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has compound leaves with a waxy texture. Its fruit is a drupe that contains a single seed, which is the source of its valuable essential oils. Due to habitat loss and limited cultivation, it is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
