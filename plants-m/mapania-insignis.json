    "intro": "Mapania insignis, commonly known as the sacred mountain orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers that bloom in shades of violet and white. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil, often growing in rocky or mountainous terrain. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Mapania insignis is considered endangered in its native range."
