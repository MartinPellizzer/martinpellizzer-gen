    "intro": "Mimosa ourobrancoensis, commonly known as the golden mimosa, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in open, sunny habitats. Its foliage is sensitive to touch, causing the leaves to fold when disturbed, a trait known as thigmonasty. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
