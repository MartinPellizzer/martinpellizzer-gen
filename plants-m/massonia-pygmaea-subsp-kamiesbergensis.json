It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features fleshy, cylindrical stems and small, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss. It produces clusters of pale blue or violet flowers during the warmer months. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a decorative succulent in gardens and collections."
