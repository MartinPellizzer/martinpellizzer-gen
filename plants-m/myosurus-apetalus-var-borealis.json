    "intro": "Myosurus apetalus var. borealis, commonly known as the northern hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arctic and alpine regions. It has slender, creeping stems that form dense mats, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with reduced flowers, characteristic of the Poaceae family. It is adapted to cold climates and can survive in harsh environmental conditions. Its presence is often an indicator of nutrient-poor, well-drained soils in high-altitude or polar ecosystems."
