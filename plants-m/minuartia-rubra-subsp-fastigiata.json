    "intro": "Minuartia rubra subsp. fastigiata, commonly known as the upright stonecrop, is a low-growing, mat-forming succulent native to rocky and alpine environments. It features dense, compact growth with small, fleshy, often blue or green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its hardy nature allows it to withstand harsh conditions, including cold temperatures and poor soil."
