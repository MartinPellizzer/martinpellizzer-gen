It features a globular stem covered in white, woolly spines and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a slow growth rate and is well-suited for rock gardens or containers due to its compact size. It requires well-draining soil and full sun to thrive. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
