    "intro": "Myristica bifurcata, commonly known as the two-branched nutmeg tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, woody structure and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into red, fleshy fruits containing a single seed. Its seeds are valued for their aromatic properties, similar to nutmeg, though less commercially significant than its relative, Myristica fragrans. The species is also notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique appearance."
