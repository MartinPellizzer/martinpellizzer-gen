It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and small yellow flowers. The plant produces numerous small, oblong fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain areas."
