    "intro": "Milium laterale, commonly known as the side bean or false millet, is a flowering plant belonging to the Poaceae family. It is a small annual grass that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils across temperate regions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture and a bluish-green color. Milium laterale is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in wet meadows, where it plays a minor role in local ecosystems."
