    "intro": "Melampodium glabrum, commonly known as the blackfoot daisy, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that produces bright yellow to orange daisy-like flowers. The plant has hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, and it thrives in full sun and well-drained soil. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators. The plant's name comes from the Greek words \"melas\" meaning black and \"podos\" meaning foot, referring to the dark, velvety appearance of its stems."
