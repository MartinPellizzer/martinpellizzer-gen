    "intro": "Mapania lentaliffii, commonly known as the Lentaliff's mapania, is a rare and unique plant species native to a specific region in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent leaves that emit a soft blue glow during the night. The plant's flowers are small and clustered, typically blooming in late spring. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Due to habitat loss, it is now considered critically endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
