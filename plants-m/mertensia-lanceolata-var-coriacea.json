    "intro": "Mertensia lanceolata var. coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf bluebells, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are rough to the touch, giving it its varietal name \"coriacea,\" which means \"coriaceous\" or leathery. The plant produces clusters of sky-blue, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are attractive to pollinators. It typically grows in moist, woodsy areas and thrives in partial to full shade. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
