    "intro": "Masdevallia tubata, commonly known as the tuberous masdevallia, is a species of orchid native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, colorful flowers in shades of pink, red, and white. The plant has fleshy, tuberous roots that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its high-altitude, cool climate. Its leaves are typically dark green and strap-like, often with a waxy coating. Masdevallia tubata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and unique appearance."
