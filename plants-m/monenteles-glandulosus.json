    "intro": "Monenteles glandulosus, commonly known as the sticky leaf orchid, is a unique orchid species native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, Monenteles glandulosus is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
