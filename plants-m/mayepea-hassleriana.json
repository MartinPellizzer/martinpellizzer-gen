It is characterized by its striking, bright yellow leaves that contrast sharply with its green stems. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, often clustered in small inflorescences. Mayepea hassleriana thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts of rare flora."
