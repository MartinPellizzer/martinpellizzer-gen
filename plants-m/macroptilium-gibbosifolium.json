    "intro": "Macroptilium gibbosifolium, commonly known as the warty-leaf burr legume, is a perennial shrub native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and trifoliate leaves with warty, glandular structures on the leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, followed by hairy, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and open woodlands. Due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptability, it is of interest in both botanical research and restoration projects."
