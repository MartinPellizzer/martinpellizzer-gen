    "intro": "Microcoelia exilis, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a small, flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant has a compact, mat-like growth habit with small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually pink or white, appearing in clusters at the base of the stems. Microcoelia exilis is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops."
