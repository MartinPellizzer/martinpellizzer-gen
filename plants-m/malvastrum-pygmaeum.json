    "intro": "Malvastrum pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf mallow, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length, giving it a compact appearance. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
