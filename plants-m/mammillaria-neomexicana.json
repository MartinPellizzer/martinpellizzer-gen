    "intro": "Mammillaria neomexicana, commonly known as the Mexican hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense covering of white, woolly spines. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It produces yellow flowers in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its spiny appearance. Due to its slow growth and unique morphology, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
