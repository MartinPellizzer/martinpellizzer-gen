    "intro": "Mimusops depressa, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape, with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant white or yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in moist woodland or coastal areas. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood and is used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber."
