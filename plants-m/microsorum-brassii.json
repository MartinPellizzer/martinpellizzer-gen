    "intro": "Microsorum brassii, commonly known as the golden sword fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with a metallic sheen. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often used in aquascaping due to its aesthetic appeal. Microsorum brassii prefers moderate to high light conditions and is relatively easy to care for in a planted aquarium. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense, carpet-like growths in suitable conditions."
