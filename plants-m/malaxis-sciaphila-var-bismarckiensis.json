    "intro": "Malaxis sciaphila var. bismarckiensis, commonly known as the Bismarck ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of New Guinea. It is characterized by its pale green, leaf-like structures that resemble foliage, making it well-camouflaged in its natural habitat. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
