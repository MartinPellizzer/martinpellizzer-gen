    "intro": "Markhamia stipulata var. cauda-felina, commonly known as the cat's tail plant, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated inflorescences that resemble a cat's tail. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink and white, which are arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into multiple pairs of leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. This species is often grown as an ornamental plant for its unique foliage and delicate floral display."
