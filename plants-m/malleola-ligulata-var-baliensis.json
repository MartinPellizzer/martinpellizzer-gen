    "intro": "Malleola ligulata var. baliensis, commonly known as the Bali leafy fern, is a variant of the Malleola ligulata species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically green with a slight sheen. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly across the forest floor. The leaves are used in traditional medicine in some cultures for their purported healing properties."
