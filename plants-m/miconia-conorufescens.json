It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves and striking, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red. Its fruit is a bright red, fleshy berry that contains numerous small seeds, aiding in its dispersal by birds and other animals. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
