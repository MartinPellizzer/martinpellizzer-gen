    "intro": "Machaerina insularis, commonly known as the Kermadec flax, is a flowering plant native to the Kermadec Islands in the South Pacific. It is a member of the daisy family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, linear leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, hemispherical heads, which are typical of the Asteraceae family. Machaerina insularis is adapted to grow in coastal environments, often on rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
