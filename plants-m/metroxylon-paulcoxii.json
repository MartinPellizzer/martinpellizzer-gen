    "intro": "Metroxylon paulcoxii, commonly known as the Paul Cox palm, is a species of palm native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces inflorescences that bear small, white flowers, which are followed by bright red fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
