    "intro": "Marsdenia salaschiblii, commonly known as the Salaschibli's Marsdenia, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by follicles that contain the seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
