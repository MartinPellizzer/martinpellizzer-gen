    "intro": "Marcellia lanata, commonly known as the woolly marcellia, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering on its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Marcellia lanata is often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodlands."
