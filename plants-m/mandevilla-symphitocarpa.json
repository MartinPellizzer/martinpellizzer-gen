    "intro": "Mandevilla symphitocarpa, commonly known as the yellow mandevilla, is a vigorous, evergreen climbing plant native to South America. It features large, showy flowers that range from yellow to orange, often with a red throat, and are borne in clusters along the stems. The plant has heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant blooms. It thrives in warm climates and requires well-draining soil and ample sunlight to flourish. Mandevilla symphitocarpa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its long flowering season and ability to climb or trail."
