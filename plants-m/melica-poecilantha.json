    "intro": "Melica poecilantha, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence bears pale green to brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
