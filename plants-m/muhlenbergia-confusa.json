    "intro": "Muhlenbergia confusa, commonly known as the silky muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, tufted shoots with fine, silver-tomentose leaves that give it a soft, fluffy appearance. The plant produces delicate, panicle-like inflorescences with small, pale blue to purple flowers in late summer to early fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping and native gardens. Muhlenbergia confusa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators and providing habitat for small wildlife."
