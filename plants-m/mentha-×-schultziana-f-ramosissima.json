    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 schultziana f. ramosissima, commonly known as the woolly mint, is a hybrid perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and branched stems, which give it a compact and bushy appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale purple to blue in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its aromatic leaves and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens for both its beauty and its subtle mint-like fragrance."
