    "intro": "Melampyrum roseum var. obtusifolium, commonly known as the blunt-leaf touch-me-not, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, erect stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with rounded tips. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. This variant is distinguished by its broader, less pointed foliage compared to other varieties of Melampyrum."
