    "intro": "Mentha arvensis var. pulegioides, commonly known as field mint or pennyroyal, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite leaves that are typically oval to lance-shaped. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas. This variety is known for its aromatic, minty scent and has been used historically in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb."
