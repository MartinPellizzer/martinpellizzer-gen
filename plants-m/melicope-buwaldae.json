    "intro": "Melicope buwaldae, commonly known as the Hawaiian melicope, is a member of the Rutaceae family and is native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded habitats within tropical rainforests. The plant has compound leaves with opposite arrangement and small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruits are woody capsules that contain several seeds, and the plant plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native environment. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered threatened or endangered in some areas."
