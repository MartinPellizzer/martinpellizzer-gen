    "intro": "Miscanthus pycnocephalus, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and tall, arching inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 feet and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive appearance and low maintenance requirements. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps over time."
