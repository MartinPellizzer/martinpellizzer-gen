    "intro": "Mimosa argillicola subsp. major, commonly known as the giant mimosa, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed sites make it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
