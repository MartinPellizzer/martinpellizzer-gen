    "intro": "Mimusops domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican satinash, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Caribbean islands. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree produces small, round fruits that are encased in a thick, waxy coating, which helps protect the seeds inside. It is often found in coastal and lowland areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens and conservation areas."
