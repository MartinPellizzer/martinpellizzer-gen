It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments.

Medicago verlotii is often found in disturbed habitats and is used in some regions for forage and soil stabilization."
