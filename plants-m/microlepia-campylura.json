    "intro": "Microlepia campylura, commonly known as the curly-leaf microlepia, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound fronds. The fronds are typically arching and have a distinctive curling appearance, especially when young. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds."
