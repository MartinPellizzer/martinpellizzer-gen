    "intro": "Macaranga roxburghii, commonly known as the giant lappa or giant macaranga, is a fast-growing, deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by capsule fruits that release tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in secondary forests and disturbed areas. Due to its rapid growth, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
