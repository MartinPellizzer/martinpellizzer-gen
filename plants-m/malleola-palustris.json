    "intro": "Malleola palustris, commonly known as the swamp mallow, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in marshy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features broad, heart-shaped leaves and produces showy, pinkish-white flowers during the summer months. Its fibrous roots help stabilize the soil, contributing to the ecological health of wetlands. Malleola palustris is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
