    "intro": "Mertensia membranacea, commonly known as the membranous bluebells, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has heart-shaped, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its root system consists of a rhizomatous structure that helps it spread and establish in suitable habitats. Mertensia membranacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
