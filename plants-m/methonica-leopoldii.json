    "intro": "Methonica leopoldii, commonly known as the Leopold's methonica, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun exposure. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with a distinctive shape that aids in pollination by insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Methonica leopoldii is considered a vulnerable species."
