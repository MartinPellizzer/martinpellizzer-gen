    "intro": "Monotropa glabra, commonly known as Indian tobacco, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on other plants for nutrients. It is found in the forests of North America, typically growing in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which help it absorb nutrients from the host plant. Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in forest ecosystems by supporting pollinators and providing habitat for various insects."
