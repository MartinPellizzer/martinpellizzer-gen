    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum deltoides var. pedunculatum, commonly known as the cushion mesem, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features dense, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it an ideal plant for low-maintenance gardens."
