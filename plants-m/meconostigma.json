    "intro": "Meconostigma, commonly known as the \"false nettle,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its upright, herbaceous stems and opposite, lanceolate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The flowers are small and clustered in dense, greenish-white inflorescences, typically found in the axils of the leaves. Meconostigma species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. These plants are not typically cultivated but are of interest to botanists due to their unique morphological features and ecological adaptations."
