It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to arctic and alpine regions, this plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun exposure. Its ability to tolerate extreme cold and drought makes it a resilient species in harsh environments. The plant's structure and flowering pattern are adaptations that help it survive in its specialized ecological niche."
