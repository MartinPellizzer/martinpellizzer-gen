    "intro": "Mitella parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered mitella, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often along stream banks and in moist woodlands. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its flowers are often surrounded by bracts that resemble petals, giving it a distinctive appearance. Mitella parviflora is valued for its ornamental qualities and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
