    "intro": "Mespilus rivularis, commonly known as the river serviceberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows along riverbanks and moist woodland areas, thriving in well-drained, fertile soils. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by edible berries that ripen in late summer. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and it can reach heights of up to 5 meters. Mespilus rivularis is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in supporting local wildlife."
