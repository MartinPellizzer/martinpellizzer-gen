It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-white flowers. The plant's leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and are often covered in fine hairs. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive appearance and ability to climb structures."
