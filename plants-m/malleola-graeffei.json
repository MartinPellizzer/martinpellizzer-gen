    "intro": "Malleola graeffei, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to eastern Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a compact shrub, with leaves that are heart-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Malleola graeffei is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
