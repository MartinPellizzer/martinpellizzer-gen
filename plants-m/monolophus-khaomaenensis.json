    "intro": "Monolophus khaomaenensis, commonly known as the Khaomaen mountain lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of northern Thailand. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its striking white and pink petals that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forested areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces a single, tall stem with a cluster of fragrant flowers. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
