    "intro": "Markea parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered markea, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Markea parviflora is often found in rocky outcrops and dry grasslands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
