    "intro": "Modiolastrum palustre, commonly known as the marsh bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features showy blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and supporting biodiversity."
