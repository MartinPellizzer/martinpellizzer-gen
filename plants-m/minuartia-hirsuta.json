    "intro": "Minuartia hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy rock-cress, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in alpine or arctic regions. Its leaves are opposite, linear, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Minuartia hirsuta is adapted to cold climates and is often found in open, disturbed habitats."
