    "intro": "Marrubium duabense, commonly known as the two-leaved horehound, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its silver-gray leaves covered in fine hairs and its small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is often found in dry, rocky soils. It has a strong, aromatic scent and is used in traditional medicine for its purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. Marrubium duabense is also valued as a ornamental plant due to its distinctive appearance and hardy nature."
