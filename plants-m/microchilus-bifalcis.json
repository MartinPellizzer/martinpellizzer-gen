    "intro": "Microchilus bifalcis, commonly known as the two-lobed bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems rise to the surface. Microchilus bifalcis is a carnivorous plant, relying on both photosynthesis and prey capture for survival."
