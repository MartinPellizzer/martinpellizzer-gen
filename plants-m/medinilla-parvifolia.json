    "intro": "Medinilla parvifolia, commonly known as the small-flowered medinilla, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and emit a mild fragrance. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom throughout the year, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Medinilla parvifolia is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded outdoor gardens due to its attractive foliage and continuous flowering."
