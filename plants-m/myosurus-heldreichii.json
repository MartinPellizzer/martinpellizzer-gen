    "intro": "Myosurus heldreichii, commonly known as the Heldreich's mouse-ear, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in early summer. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
