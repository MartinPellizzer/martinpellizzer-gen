    "intro": "Mimulus angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf monkeyflower, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the western United States. It features elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces striking, two-lipped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant typically grows in moist, sunny habitats such as stream banks and meadows. Its flowers attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and butterflies, due to their nectar-rich structure. Mimulus angustifolius is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
