    "intro": "Miconia lurida, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its fruit is a bright red, fleshy drupe that contains several seeds. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
