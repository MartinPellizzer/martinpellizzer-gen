    "intro": "Marsilea diffusa var. normalis, commonly known as water clover, is a floating aquatic plant native to Asia. It features small, four-leaf clover-like fronds that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the water. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and wetlands. It plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for aquatic organisms. Its rapid growth makes it both a useful water purifier and a potential weed in ponds."
