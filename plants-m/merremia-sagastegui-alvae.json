    "intro": "Merremia sagastegui-alvae, commonly known as the Peruvian morning glory, is a climbing vine native to South America. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that open in the morning. The plant produces yellow-orange fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded areas. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
