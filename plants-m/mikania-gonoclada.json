    "intro": "Mikania gonoclada, commonly known as the hairy vine or jungle vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rapid growth and climbing habit. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a pubescent surface, and its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some areas where it is introduced."
