It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with distinctive white and green variegation, creating a visually appealing foliage pattern. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
