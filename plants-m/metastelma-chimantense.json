    "intro": "Metastelma chimantense, commonly known as the Chimant\u00e9 mountain mistplant, is a rare flowering plant native to the humid montane forests of northern South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of white and pink. Its leaves are typically elliptical and have a waxy texture, adapted to the high humidity of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
