    "intro": "Maranta riedeliana, commonly known as the Riedel's prayer plant, is a tropical species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its striking, often variegated leaves that change color and pattern in response to light and temperature, a phenomenon known as nyctinasty. The plant belongs to the Marantaceae family, which includes many ornamental species prized for their foliage. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique leaf movements and vibrant colors make it a popular choice for indoor gardening and botanical collections."
