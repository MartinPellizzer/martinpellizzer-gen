    "intro": "Mammillaria simpsonii, commonly known as Simpson's hedgehog cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular stem covered in white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It prefers well-draining soil and full sun exposure. Due to its delicate nature, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in protected outdoor environments."
