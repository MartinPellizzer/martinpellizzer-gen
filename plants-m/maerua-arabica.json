    "intro": "Maerua arabica, commonly known as the African sandthorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and spiny stems, which are adaptations to its harsh environment. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It produces small, dry fruits containing seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Maerua arabica is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
