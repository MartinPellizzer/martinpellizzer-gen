    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum tradescantioides, commonly known as the carpetweed or false spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a succulent species with fleshy, often blue-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid conditions."
