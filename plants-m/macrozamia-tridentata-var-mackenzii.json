    "intro": "Macrozamia tridentata var. mackenzii, commonly known as the Mackenzie cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the coastal regions of northern New South Wales, Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, feather-like leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It is adapted to grow in well-drained, sandy soils and thrives in coastal climates with moderate rainfall. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
