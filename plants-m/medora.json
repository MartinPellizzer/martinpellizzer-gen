    "intro": "Medora, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual or perennial herb with slender, branching stems and small, often hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Medora is adapted to hot, dry environments and has deep roots to access groundwater. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects in desert landscapes."
