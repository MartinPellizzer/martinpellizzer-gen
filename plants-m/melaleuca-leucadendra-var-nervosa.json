    "intro": "Melaleuca leucadendra var. nervosa, commonly known as the narrow-veined melaleuca, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia, where it thrives in sandy soils and saline environments. The plant is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers. It produces woody capsules that contain numerous small, dark seeds. This variety is often used in coastal vegetation restoration due to its salt tolerance and ability to stabilize dunes."
