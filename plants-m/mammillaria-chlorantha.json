    "intro": "Mammillaria chlorantha, commonly known as the blue mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in white to blue-gray spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections due to its compact size and attractive appearance."
