    "intro": "Melicope leptophylla, commonly known as the slender-leaf melicope, is a small evergreen tree native to the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii, Tahiti, and other parts of Polynesia. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its aromatic, often fragrant leaves. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to humid, tropical climates. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers followed by orange or red fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
