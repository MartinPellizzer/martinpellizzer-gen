    "intro": "Malaxis brevidentata, commonly known as the narrow-toothed lady's slipper, is a terrestrial orchid native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, pouch-like flower that resembles a slipper, which is a defining feature of the Orchidaceae family. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety coating. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellowish, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Malaxis brevidentata is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitats."
