    "intro": "Mammillaria prismatica, commonly known as the prism cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is a small, globular plant with a ribbed stem that typically grows to a height of about 10 centimeters. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its stems are covered in white, waxy spines that help protect it from predators and reduce water loss. Mammillaria prismatica is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
