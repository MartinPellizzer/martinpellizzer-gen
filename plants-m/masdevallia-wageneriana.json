    "intro": "Masdevallia wageneriana, commonly known as the Wagener's masdevallia, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It features intricate, often colorful flowers with a unique structure, including a spurred lip that serves as a nectar source for pollinators. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its foliage consists of narrow, leathery leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid, high-altitude habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a delicate species requiring careful conservation efforts."
