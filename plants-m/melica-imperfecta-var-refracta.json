    "intro": "Melica imperfecta var. refracta, commonly known as the narrowleaf brome, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. Its flowering period usually occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. This species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soil and supporting local insect populations."
