    "intro": "Maharanga, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a revered plant in many cultures, particularly in South and Southeast Asia. It is a water plant with large, showy flowers that bloom in a variety of colors, including pink, red, and white. The plant is often associated with purity and spiritual significance, especially in Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, floating on the surface of still water. The maharanga's ability to thrive in aquatic environments makes it an important part of wetland ecosystems."
