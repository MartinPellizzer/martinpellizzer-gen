    "intro": "Melica ciliata f. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf meadowgrass, is a variant of the slender meadowgrass species. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive hairy edge along the leaf margins. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which are small clusters of flowers. This form is notable for its broader leaf blades compared to the typical species, making it easily distinguishable in botanical studies."
