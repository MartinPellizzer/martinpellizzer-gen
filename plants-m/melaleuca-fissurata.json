    "intro": "Melaleuca fissurata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels away in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bottle-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, which are borne in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slight sheen, and they are arranged alternately along the branches. Melaleuca fissurata is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
