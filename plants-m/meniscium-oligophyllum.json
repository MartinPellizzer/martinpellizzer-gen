    "intro": "Meniscium oligophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved meniscium, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered umbels of white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has finely divided, pinnate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an attractive addition to gardens and a valuable subject for ecological studies."
