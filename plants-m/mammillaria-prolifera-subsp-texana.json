    "intro": "Mammillaria prolifera subsp. texana, commonly known as the Texas hedgehog cactus, is a low-growing cactus native to the south-central United States. It features cylindrical stems covered in white to pale green spines and small, rounded tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and container gardening."
