    "intro": "Munnozia hirta, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky slopes. The plant features showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually hairy and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Munnozia hirta has a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soil conditions and withstand periods of drought."
