    "intro": "Melicope villosa, commonly known as the hairy melicope, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces yellowish-orange fruits that are typically eaten by birds and other animals, aiding in seed dispersal. Melicope villosa is often found in coastal and lowland forest habitats, where it thrives in humid, well-drained soils. Its hairy stems and leaves give it a distinctive appearance, making it recognizable in its native environments."
