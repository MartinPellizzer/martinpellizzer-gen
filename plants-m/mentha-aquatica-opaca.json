    "intro": "Mentha aquatica opaca, commonly known as water mint, is a perennial herb native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It features square, hairy stems and opposite, serrated leaves that are often submerged or floating in water. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers in whorled clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its aromatic leaves contain menthol and other volatile oils, which contribute to its medicinal and culinary uses. Mentha aquatica opaca thrives in moist soils and is often found near streams, ponds, and marshy areas."
