It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a fleshy, orange-red drupe that contains a single seed. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes in warm climates."
