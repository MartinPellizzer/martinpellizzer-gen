It produces small, green, angular fruits that are typically harvested when they are still unripe and tart. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and thrives in warm, humid climates. Its flowers are yellow and clustered, and it is often cultivated for its edible, acidic fruits. The botanical features of Melothria angulata make it a distinctive and adaptable species within the Cucurbitaceae family."
