    "intro": "Malva sylvestris var. tomentella, commonly known as the woolly mallow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fuzzy, grayish-green leaves covered in fine hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Its hairy stems and leaves are adapted to retain moisture, making it resilient in humid environments."
