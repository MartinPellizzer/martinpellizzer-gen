    "intro": "Maclura affinis, commonly known as the yellow wood or honeylocust, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Moraceae and is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often divided into three to seven segments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by oval, woody fruits that turn yellow or orange when mature. Its bark is thick and fissured, and it is known for its slow growth and longevity, often living over a century.
