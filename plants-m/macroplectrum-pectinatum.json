    "intro": "Macroplectrum pectinatum, commonly known as the pectinate fern, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive pinnate fronds with a pectinate structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in humid tropical forests. Its leaves are long and narrow, with a leathery texture and a serrated margin. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
