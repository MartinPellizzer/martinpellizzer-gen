    "intro": "Mimosa debilis var. amnis-mortium, commonly known as the ghost mimosa, is a rare and striking plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait known as thigmonasty. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a subtle beauty to its appearance. Its unique morphology and ephemeral blooms make it a subject of interest in botanical studies. However, due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
