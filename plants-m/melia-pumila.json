It typically grows to a height of about 3 to 5 meters and has smooth, gray bark that peels in thin layers. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by round, green fruits that turn yellow when mature. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly rough texture. Melia pumila is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in some cultures."
