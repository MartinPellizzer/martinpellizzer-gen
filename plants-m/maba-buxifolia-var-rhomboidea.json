    "intro": "Maba buxifolia var. rhomboidea, commonly known as the rhomboid maba, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand and Malaysia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, glossy leaves. The leaves are typically elliptical or rhomboid in shape, hence the variety name, and are often arranged in whorls along the stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in cyathia, a typical feature of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a ornamental plant due to its hardy nature and attractive foliage."
