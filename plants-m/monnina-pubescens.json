    "intro": "Monnina pubescens, commonly known as the hairy monnina, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Monnina pubescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
