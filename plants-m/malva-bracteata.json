    "intro": "Malva bracteata, commonly known as the bracted mallows, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and arid environments. The plant features showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the stems are hairy, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Malva bracteata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
