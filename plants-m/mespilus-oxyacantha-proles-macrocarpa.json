    "intro": "Mespilus oxyacantha proles macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited blackthorn, is a variant of the blackthorn species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark, thorny stems and small, oval leaves that are typically glossy in appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by black, plum-like berries in late summer. These berries are edible but have a tart flavor and are often used in culinary or medicinal applications. The species is known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
