    "intro": "Melampyrum degenianum, commonly known as the false toadflax, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on its host for water and nutrients while still performing photosynthesis. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with two lips and five stamens. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves."
