    "intro": "Mimosa neuroloma, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and early summer. Its growth habit is upright, with stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height. Mimosa neuroloma thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
