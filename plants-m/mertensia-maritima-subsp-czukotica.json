    "intro": "Mertensia maritima subsp. czukotica, commonly known as the coastal bluebells, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking clusters of blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in dunes and salt marshes. Its botanical features make it well adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and frequent wind exposure."
