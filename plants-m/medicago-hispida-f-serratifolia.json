It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial with trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers. The leaves are characterized by their serrated margins, which distinguish this form from the typical species. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or disturbed areas. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
