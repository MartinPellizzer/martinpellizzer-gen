    "intro": "Minuartia umbellulifera, commonly known as the starflower or rock jasmine, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, white or pinkish star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous and tundra environments. Its leaves are typically opposite, linear, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates. Minuartia umbellulifera is also known for its ability to survive in extreme cold and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
