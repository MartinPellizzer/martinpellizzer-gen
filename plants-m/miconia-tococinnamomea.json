    "intro": "Miconia tococinnamomea, commonly known as the golden miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Neotropics. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that are typically followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
