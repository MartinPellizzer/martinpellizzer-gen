    "intro": "Mammillaria setosa, commonly known as the woolly hedgehog cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that give it its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of about 5 to 10 centimeters and has a short, thick stem. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, appearing in late spring or early summer. Mammillaria setosa is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
