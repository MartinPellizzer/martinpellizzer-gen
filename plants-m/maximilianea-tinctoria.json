It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and arid environments. The plant features broad, heart-shaped leaves and produces striking, showy red or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots help it survive in harsh, drought-prone conditions. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in dye production."
