    "intro": "Mucuna revoluta, commonly known as the velvet bean, is a tropical legume native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a protein source. The plant's rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing ability make it useful in agricultural systems."
