    "intro": "Marcetia, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often silvery or grayish in color due to a dense covering of fine hairs. Marcetia species typically produce small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. These plants are often used in traditional medicine and for their ornamental value."
