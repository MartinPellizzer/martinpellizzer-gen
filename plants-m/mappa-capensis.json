It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, simple leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkin-like inflorescences, followed by orange-red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Mappa capensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
