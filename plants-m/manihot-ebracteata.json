    "intro": "Manihot ebracteata, commonly known as the slender arrowleaf manioc, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and large, arrow-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it is known for its milky sap, which can be toxic. Its roots are used in traditional medicine and as a source of starch, though it is less commonly cultivated than other manioc species."
