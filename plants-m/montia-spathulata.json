    "intro": "Montia spathulata, commonly known as broadleaf mountain-mint, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically features basal leaves that are broadly ovate to spatulate in shape, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in dense terminal clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and forest margins. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
