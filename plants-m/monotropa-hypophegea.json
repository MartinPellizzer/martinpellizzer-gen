    "intro": "Monotropa hypophegea, commonly known as the Indian tobacco, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It relies on its host plants, typically members of the Ericaceae family, for nutrients. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are usually scale-like and are arranged in a whorl around the stem. Monotropa hypophegea is often found in shaded, moist forest environments across North America."
