    "intro": "Metathelypteris subadscendens, commonly known as the ascending water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant exhibits a unique growth habit, with fronds that may ascend or trail depending on water conditions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to substrates in wetlands and marshes. The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, typical of the fern family."
