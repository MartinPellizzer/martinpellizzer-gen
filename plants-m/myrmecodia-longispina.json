    "intro": "Myrmecodia longispina, commonly known as the ant-plant, is a unique tropical shrub belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its hollow, segmented stems that provide shelter for colonies of ants. The plant forms a mutualistic relationship with its resident ants, which defend it from herbivores in exchange for shelter and nectar. Its small, white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, spherical fruits. Myrmecodia longispina is native to Southeast Asia and is often found in lowland rainforests."
