    "intro": "Mentha riparia var. pilosa, commonly known as hairy water mint, is a perennial herb native to moist environments in North America. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows near streams, wet meadows, and other waterlogged areas, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a strong minty aroma, while the small, tubular flowers bloom in clusters during the summer months. This variety is often used in herbal remedies and is also valued for its ecological benefits in supporting pollinators."
