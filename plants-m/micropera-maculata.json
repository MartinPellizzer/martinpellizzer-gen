    "intro": "Micropera maculata, commonly known as the spotted micropera, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, exhibiting a compact growth habit with short, upright stems. The plant features small, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often with a slight pinkish tinge. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and have a velvety texture, with a distinct spotted pattern on the underside. Micropera maculata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments."
