It is a small shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy, giving it its common name. Its flowers are small, clustered, and usually pink or red, with five petals. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds, contributing to its propagation in the wild."
