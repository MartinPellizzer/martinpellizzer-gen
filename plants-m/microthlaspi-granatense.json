    "intro": "Microthlaspi granatense, commonly known as the Granatense Bittercress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is a small annual herb that typically grows in rocky or disturbed soils, often found in alpine or arctic regions. The plant has slender stems and produces small, white or pale pink flowers with four petals. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and the plant is characterized by its peppery taste due to the presence of glucosinolates. Microthlaspi granatense is adapted to cold climates and is often used in ecological studies to assess environmental changes in high-altitude ecosystems."
