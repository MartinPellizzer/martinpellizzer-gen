    "intro": "Medicago romanica subsp. revoluta, commonly known as the revolute medick, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves with rolled margins, which give it its subspecific name \"revoluta.\" The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in racemes, typical of many legumes. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. This subspecies is valued for its role in soil nitrogen fixation and as a forage plant for livestock."
