    "intro": "Melicope christophersenii, commonly known as the Hawaiian melicope, is a member of the Rutaceae family and is native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a small evergreen tree or shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests. The plant has simple, opposite, and often lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. Its flowers are small and yellow, clustered in inflorescences, and it produces fleshy, reddish berries as fruit. Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
