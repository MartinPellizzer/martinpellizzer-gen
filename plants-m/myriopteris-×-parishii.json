    "intro": "Myriopteris \u00d7 parishii, commonly known as the hybrid cliff brake, is a fern that exhibits characteristics of both its parent species, Myriopteris richardii and Myriopteris torreyi. It is a small to medium-sized fern with fronds that are typically bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division, giving them a finely divided appearance. The plant is native to the western United States, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils, often found on cliffs and slopes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, and they are arranged in a distinctive linear pattern. Myriopteris \u00d7 parishii is a relatively rare hybrid, and its botanical study provides insights into the genetic diversity and adaptability of ferns in arid environments."
