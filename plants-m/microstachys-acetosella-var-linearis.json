It features trifoliate leaves with a distinctive heart-shaped leaflet and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves contain oxalic acid, giving them a tangy, sour taste. The species is characterized by its linear leaflets and is often found growing in clusters along the forest floor."
