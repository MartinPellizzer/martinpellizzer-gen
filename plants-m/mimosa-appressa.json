    "intro": "Mimosa appressa, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that rapidly fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and summer. Its growth habit is herbaceous, with a trailing or climbing form depending on the environment. Mimosa appressa thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
