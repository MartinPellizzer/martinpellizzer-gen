    "intro": "Microchilus rojasii, commonly known as the Rosas' microchilus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Andean highlands of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations between 3,000 and 5,000 meters. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to the harsh, high-altitude environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Microchilus rojasii is considered a species of conservation concern."
