    "intro": "Mikania populifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf morning glory, is a fast-growing vine native to the Americas. It features heart-shaped, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, showy blue or purple flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. It is known for its ability to climb and spread rapidly, often forming dense thickets. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native range."
