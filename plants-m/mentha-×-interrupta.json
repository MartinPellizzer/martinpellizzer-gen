    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 interrupta, commonly known as catnip, is a hybrid perennial plant in the mint family (Lamiaceae). It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that are clustered in whorls along the stems. Its aromatic leaves contain high concentrations of nepetalactone, which is responsible for its distinctive scent and effects on cats. Mentha \u00d7 interrupta is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been naturalized in many regions around the world."
