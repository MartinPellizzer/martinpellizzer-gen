    "intro": "Minuartia mesogitana subsp. lydia, commonly known as the Lydian rock-cress, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant has dark green, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in rocky and gravelly soils, often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
