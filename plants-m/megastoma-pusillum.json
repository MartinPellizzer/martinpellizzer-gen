    "intro": "Megastoma pusillum, commonly known as the small bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are simple and often submerged, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually with five petals. Megastoma pusillum is a carnivorous plant that relies on its bladders to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor waters."
