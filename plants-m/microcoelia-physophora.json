    "intro": "Microcoelia physophora, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer, often in shaded, humid environments. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered vulnerable and requires specific conditions to thrive."
