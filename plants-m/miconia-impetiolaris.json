    "intro": "Miconia impetiolaris, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub belonging to the Melastomataceae family. It is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. Its flowers are showy, with five pink or red petals and prominent yellow stamens, attracting various pollinators. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
