    "intro": "Myrcia leonis, commonly known as the lemon myrtle, is a tropical shrub native to northern Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, lemon-scented leaves. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional Aboriginal medicine and as a culinary herb due to their high content of citral. Myrcia leonis thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth."
