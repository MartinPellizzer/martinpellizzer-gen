It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and small, clustered flowers that develop into the familiar black, white, and green peppercorns. The plant belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is cultivated for its aromatic seeds used as a spice. Its growth is typically slow, and it requires a humid, warm climate with well-drained soil. The fruit, which is a small, yellowish drupe, turns dark when ripe and is harvested for its valuable seed kernels."
