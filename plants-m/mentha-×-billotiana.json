    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 billotiana, commonly known as African mint, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Mentha piperita (peppermint) and Mentha arvensis (field mint). It is characterized by its aromatic, slightly minty scent and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring square stems and opposite, ovate leaves. Its flowers are small and tubular, usually purple or pink, and appear in whorls along the stem. Mentha \u00d7 billotiana is often used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb, though it is less commonly cultivated than other mint species."
