    "intro": "Mammillaria oothele, commonly known as the Oothele hedgehog cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular stem covered in white, woolly spines that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
