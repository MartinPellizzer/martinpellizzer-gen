    "intro": "Mallea, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants native to Australia. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its woody, often twisted stems and small, leathery leaves. The plant produces distinctive yellow or orange flowers that attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Mallea species are typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, where they have adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions. Due to overharvesting, many species of Mallea are now classified as threatened or endangered."
