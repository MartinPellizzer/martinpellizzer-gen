    "intro": "Melaleuca calothamnoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a white or pale inner layer, and its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in coastal and subcoastal regions. Melaleuca calothamnoides is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in horticulture for its hardy nature and visual interest."
