    "intro": "Mikania rhomboidea, commonly known as the heartleaf morning glory, is a climbing vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range from yellow to orange. The plant thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential invasive species. The seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
