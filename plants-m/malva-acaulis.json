    "intro": "Malva acaulis, commonly known as the upright mallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its erect, hairless stems and heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers with five petals, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry grasslands and rocky areas. Malva acaulis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine for its mucilage-rich leaves."
