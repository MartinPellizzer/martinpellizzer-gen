    "intro": "Myriophyllum echinatum, commonly known as spiked milfoil, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shallow water, such as ponds and lakes, and is often found in slow-moving streams. Its roots form dense mats that help stabilize sediments and provide habitat for aquatic life. Myriophyllum echinatum is also known for its ability to tolerate a range of water conditions and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
