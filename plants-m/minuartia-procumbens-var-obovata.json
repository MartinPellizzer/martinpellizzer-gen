    "intro": "Minuartia procumbens var. obovata, commonly known as the creeping rockcress, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It features small, obovate (egg-shaped with the broader end at the base) leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers with four petals, which bloom in early summer. It is adapted to harsh conditions, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. This variety is often found in mountainous regions across Europe and parts of Asia."
