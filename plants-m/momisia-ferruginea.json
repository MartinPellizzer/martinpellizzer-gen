    "intro": "Momisia ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty momisia, is a shrub native to the dry regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are often covered in a rusty-brown pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its root system is adapted to survive in arid conditions, making it drought-tolerant. It is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in dry gardens."
