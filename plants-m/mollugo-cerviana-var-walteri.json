It typically features prostrate stems covered in small, translucent blue-green leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas. Its botanical characteristics make it an attractive and resilient ground cover in native plant gardens."
