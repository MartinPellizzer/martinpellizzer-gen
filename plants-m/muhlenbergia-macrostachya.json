    "intro": "Muhlenbergia macrostachya, commonly known as the giant muhlenberggrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and fluffy, silver-tan seed heads that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its upright growth habit and the showy, feathery appearance of its inflorescence. It is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
