    "intro": "Miconia rufoalpestris, commonly known as the red-barked miconia, is a shrub or small tree native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by distinctive, round, red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
