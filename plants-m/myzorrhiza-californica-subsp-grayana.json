    "intro": "Myzorrhiza californica subsp. grayana, commonly known as the gray's myzorrhiza, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche and limited distribution."
