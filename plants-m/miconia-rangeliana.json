    "intro": "Miconia rangeliana, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it an invasive species in some regions. The plant's botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a challenge for land management."
