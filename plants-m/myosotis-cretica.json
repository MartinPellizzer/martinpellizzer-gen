    "intro": "Myosotis cretica, commonly known as the creeping forget-me-not, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, delicate blue or purple flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Myosotis cretica thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
