    "intro": "Myriopteris induta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf huperzia, is a species of clubmoss native to the southeastern United States. It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and woodlands. The plant has elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are densely packed along its stems, giving it a compact appearance. Its sporangia are clustered in small, rounded structures called strobili, which are borne on the upper surfaces of the leaves. Myriopteris induta is characterized by its simple, dichotomous branching pattern and its ability to thrive in humid, acidic soils."
