    "intro": "Mormodes tapoayensis, commonly known as the Philippine orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure and delicate appearance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and often have a distinctive coloration that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
