    "intro": "Mouriri petroniana, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit tree, is a tropical evergreen plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and small, yellow-orange fruits that resemble starfruits. The plant produces a milky latex sap, which is used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Its fruit is edible, though the skin is usually discarded, and the pulp contains a high amount of vitamin C. Mouriri petroniana plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing food for various wildlife species."
