    "intro": "Mycopteris cretata, commonly known as the Cretaceous fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the Caribbean and Central America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a unique reproductive structure, with sori arranged in a single row along the margins of the pinnae. Its spore-producing structures are covered by a protective indusium, which is a feature common in many fern species. Mycopteris cretata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
