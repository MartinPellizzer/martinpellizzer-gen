    "intro": "Mentha longifolia var. taphrophila, commonly known as the sweet cicely or wild chervil, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, finely divided leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces a mild, anise-like scent, which is attributed to its essential oils containing compounds such as anethole. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. This variety is less commonly cultivated than other mint species but is valued for its culinary and medicinal properties."
