    "intro": "Mimosa paludosa, commonly known as the swamp mimosa, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing herbaceous perennial that thrives in wetland environments such as marshes and swamps. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, spherical flower heads that resemble miniature balls, which open and close in response to touch. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets that are sensitive to light and touch. Mimosa paludosa plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various insects and wildlife."
