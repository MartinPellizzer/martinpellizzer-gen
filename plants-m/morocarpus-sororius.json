    "intro": "Morocarpus sororius, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant has a short, woody stem and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Its leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Morocarpus sororius is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
