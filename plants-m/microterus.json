    "intro": "Microterus, commonly known as the dwarf fern, is a genus of small, tropical ferns belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. These plants typically have delicate, lace-like fronds that are often less than 10 centimeters in length. They thrive in humid, shaded environments, often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Microterus species are characterized by their compact growth habit and intricate, finely divided leaves. Their reproductive structures, known as sori, are usually located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to their unique botanical appearance."
