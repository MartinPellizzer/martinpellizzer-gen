    "intro": "Mangium, commonly known as the mangrove tree, is a group of salt-tolerant trees and shrubs that thrive in coastal intertidal zones. These plants have specialized root systems, including pneumatophores, which help them absorb oxygen from the waterlogged soil. Mangium species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, where they play a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and supporting diverse ecosystems. Their ability to filter salt from seawater allows them to flourish in brackish environments. The botanical features of mangium make them vital for coastal protection and biodiversity."
