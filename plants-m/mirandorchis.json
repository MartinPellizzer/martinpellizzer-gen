    "intro": "Mirandorchis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, pale green to white flowers that resemble a ghostly apparition. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has a short, leafless stem and produces its flowers directly from the base of the stem. Due to its habitat specificity and declining population, Mirandorchis is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
