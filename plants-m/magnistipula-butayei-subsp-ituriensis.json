    "intro": "Magnistipula butayei subsp. ituriensis, commonly known as the Ituri magnistipula, is a shrub or small tree native to the rainforests of Central Africa. It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
