    "intro": "Miconia mirabilis, commonly known as the red miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and northern South America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves that often have a waxy coating. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which attract various pollinators. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Miconia mirabilis is often cultivated for its ornamental value in warm climates due to its striking foliage and floral display."
