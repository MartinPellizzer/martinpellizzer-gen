It is characterized by its showy, orange to yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, sunny environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are usually hairy as well. This variant is distinguished by its elongated, clustered flower clusters, which give it a unique appearance compared to other Mimulus species."
