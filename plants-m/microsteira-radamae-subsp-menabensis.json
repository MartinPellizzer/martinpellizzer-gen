    "intro": "Microsteira radamae subsp. menabensis, commonly known as the Menabe microsteira, is a rare flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat, often growing in shaded forest understories. Its leaves are opposite and elliptical, with a smooth texture, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
