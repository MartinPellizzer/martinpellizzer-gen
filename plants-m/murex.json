    "intro": "Murex, commonly known as the sea snail, is a genus of predatory sea snails belonging to the family Muricidae. These marine gastropod mollusks are characterized by their thick, calcareous shells, often adorned with intricate patterns and spines. Murex species are typically found in warm coastal waters and are known for their ability to secrete a toxic substance used for defense. The genus includes several species, some of which have been historically valued for their vividly colored shells. Botanically, while not a plant, the murex is studied for its ecological role in marine environments and its chemical compounds."
