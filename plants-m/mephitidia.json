    "intro": "Mephitidia, commonly known as the devil's fig, is a rare and peculiar plant native to the dense rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, fleshy, and often bioluminescent fruit that emits a faint glow in the dark. The plant's leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to thrive in high humidity and low light conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically blooming in shades of purple and pink. Despite its unusual appearance, the Mephitidia is not toxic, though its fruit is rarely consumed due to its strong, unpleasant odor."
