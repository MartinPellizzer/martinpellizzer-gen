    "intro": "Medicago falcata subsp. pinetorum, commonly known as the Appalachian needlepod, is a perennial legume native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, spiny stems and trifoliate leaves with narrow, pointed leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by elongated, needle-like pods that contain small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and pine forests. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and its use in forage and erosion control."
