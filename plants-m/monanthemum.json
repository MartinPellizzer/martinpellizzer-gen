These plants are characterized by their solitary, showy flowers that often stand alone on long, slender stalks. They are typically herbaceous and can be found in various habitats, including grasslands and disturbed soils. Monanthemum species are native to North America and are often adapted to dry or arid environments. Their unique floral structure makes them a subject of interest in botanical studies and horticulture."
