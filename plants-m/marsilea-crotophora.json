    "intro": "Marsilea crotophora, commonly known as water clover, is a floating aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its four-leaf clover-like structure, which is a distinctive botanical feature. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its leaves are typically submerged, with the upper surface bearing small, rounded lobes. Marsilea crotophora produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by the development of small, bladder-like fruits."
