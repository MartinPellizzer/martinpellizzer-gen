    "intro": "Marsdenia matudae, commonly known as the Matudae Marsdenia, is a species of flowering plant in the Asclepiadaceae family. It is native to the Philippines and is characterized by its climbing habit and slender, woody stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by follicles containing seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
