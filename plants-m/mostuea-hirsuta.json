    "intro": "Mostuea hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy marsh grass, is a perennial herb native to wetland and swampy areas in Southeast Asia. It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often with a reddish or purplish hue. The plant produces panicles of small, white to pale green flowers, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine, hairy texture, contributing to its common name. Mostuea hirsuta is adapted to waterlogged soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
