    "intro": "Mimosa leptorhachis, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in summer, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique movement and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
