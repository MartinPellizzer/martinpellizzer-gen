    "intro": "Maxillaria microdendron, commonly known as the miniature dendron orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It features a sympodial growth habit with a rhizome and pseudobulbs that support its foliage and flowers. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are ovate and arranged in a fan-like pattern, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Maxillaria microdendron thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
