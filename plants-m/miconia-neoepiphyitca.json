    "intro": "Miconia neoepiphyitca, commonly known as the epiphytic miconia, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features large, broad leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, producing a distinctive yellowish-green color. Miconia neoepiphyitca plays a role in the ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various insect species."
