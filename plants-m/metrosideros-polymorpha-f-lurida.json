    "intro": "Metrosideros polymorpha f. lurida, commonly known as the red-flowered Tahitian pohutukawa, is a variant of the native Hawaiian tree known for its striking red blossoms. This form is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and smaller, more clustered leaves compared to the typical form. It thrives in coastal and lowland areas, often growing in full sun and well-drained soils. The plant is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its vibrant floral display. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a distinct form within the species, contributing to the biodiversity of Hawaiian flora."
