    "intro": "Mammillaria decora, commonly known as the Decorate Cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense covering of white spines. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10-15 centimeters and produces yellow flowers in the spring. Its stems are ribbed and covered with small, raised bumps called areoles. Mammillaria decora is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its slow growth and low maintenance requirements."
