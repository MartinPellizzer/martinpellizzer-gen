    "intro": "Munnozia senecionidis, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open landscapes. The plant produces yellow, dandelion-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is well adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
