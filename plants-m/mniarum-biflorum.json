    "intro": "Mniarum biflorum, commonly known as the two-flowered mniarum, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Mniarum biflorum is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
