    "intro": "Meliosma yunnanensis var. fischeriana, commonly known as the Yunnan meliosma, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Meliosma genus. It is native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China, where it thrives in cool, moist, and shaded forest environments. The plant is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves with a distinctive waxy texture and a pale green to silver underside. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters, and it produces dark brown, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
