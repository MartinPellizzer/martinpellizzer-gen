    "intro": "Melicope oppenheimeri, commonly known as the Hawaiian melicope, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its aromatic, often fragrant leaves. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 6 meters, with smooth, grayish bark and opposite, ovate leaves. Its small, white flowers are followed by round, yellowish fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its restricted habitat and vulnerability to invasive species, it is considered endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation laws."
