    "intro": "Melochia pseudonodiflora, commonly known as the velvetleaf melochia, is a tropical shrub belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by distinctive, triangular-shaped fruits. It is native to regions of Africa and thrives in humid, warm climates. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
