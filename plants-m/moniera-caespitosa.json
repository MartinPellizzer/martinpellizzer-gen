    "intro": "Moniera caespitosa, commonly known as the tufted moss, is a species of moss characterized by its dense, clump-forming growth habit. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a central stem with closely packed leaves that are often curved and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short stalks at the tips of the stems. Moniera caespitosa plays an important ecological role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its habitat."
