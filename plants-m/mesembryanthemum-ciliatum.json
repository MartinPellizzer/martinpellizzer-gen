    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum ciliatum, commonly known as the carpetweed or coastal daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing succulent with fleshy, often hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is often found along coastal areas. Mesembryanthemum ciliatum is popular in gardens for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
