    "intro": "Maranta purpurea, commonly known as the purple-leaf maranta, is a tropical flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety purple foliage that contrasts beautifully with its glossy green leaves. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters during the warm season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Maranta purpurea is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its ornamental leaves and ease of care."
