    "intro": "Mammillaria glassii, commonly known as the glassy mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its small, globular shape and a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that give it a glassy appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
