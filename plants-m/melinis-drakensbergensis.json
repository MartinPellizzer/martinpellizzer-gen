    "intro": "Melinis drakensbergensis, commonly known as the Drakensberg grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and rocky outcrops. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
