    "intro": "Machilus edulis, commonly known as the Chinese boxwood, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, dark green leaves that are glossy and leathery in texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by dark blue, fleshy berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Machilus edulis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact growth habit and ability to tolerate urban environments. Its botanical features make it a valuable species in horticulture and ecological restoration projects."
