It is characterized by its striking, tubular, red-orange flowers that bloom in clusters along its stems. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Mandevilla dissimilis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant flowers and vigorous growth habit."
