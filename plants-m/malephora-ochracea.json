It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant is notable for its yellow-orange flowers and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities. Its seeds are enclosed in a fibrous pod and are often used in traditional medicine. The plant's botanical features make it an important species in ecological and agricultural contexts."
