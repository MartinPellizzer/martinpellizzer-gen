    "intro": "Microsorum egregium, commonly known as the golden sword fern, is a species of water fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, sword-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a metallic sheen. The plant thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, often found in slow-moving streams and ponds. Its rhizomes form dense mats, helping to stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for small aquatic organisms. Microsorum egregium is popular in aquariums due to its ornamental appearance and ease of care."
