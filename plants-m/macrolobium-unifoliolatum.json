    "intro": "Macrolobium unifoliolatum, commonly known as the single leaf macrolobium, is a unique tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its singular, large, leathery leaf that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or green, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
