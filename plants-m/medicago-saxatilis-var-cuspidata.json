It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in mountainous regions. It has a low-growing habit with hairy stems and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. This variety is adapted to harsh conditions and plays a role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
