    "intro": "Marsilea muelleri, commonly known as the water clover, is a small aquatic fern native to Australia. It has four small, floating leaves that resemble clover leaves, with each leaflet having a single pore at the base. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. It produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are borne on short stalks above the water surface. Marsilea muelleri is often used in aquariums and water gardens due to its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in moist conditions."
