It is a small shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal or mountainous regions. The plant features narrow, evergreen leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. It is well adapted to arid conditions and can tolerate drought. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
