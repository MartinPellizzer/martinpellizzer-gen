    "intro": "Medicago truncatula f. tricycla, commonly known as the Tricycle Medick, is a variant of the common medick, characterized by its unique tricyclic leaf morphology. This plant is a low-growing annual legume native to the Mediterranean region and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It has trifoliate leaves with three rounded leaflets, and its small, yellow flowers are clustered in racemes. The plant is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. It is also used in ecological studies and as a model organism in plant biology research."
