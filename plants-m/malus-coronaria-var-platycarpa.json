    "intro": "Malus coronaria var. platycarpa, commonly known as the broad-fruited apple or the broad-fruit crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to western China. It is characterized by its showy, pink to white flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces edible, round, yellow or red fruits that are typically larger and less tart than those of other crabapple varieties. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges and turn vibrant shades of red or orange in the fall. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
