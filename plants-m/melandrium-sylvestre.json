    "intro": "Melandrium sylvestre, commonly known as the wild catchfly, is a flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and typically grows in moist, disturbed habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant produces showy, pink or white flowers with five petals, and its stems are covered in fine, sticky hairs. Its seed capsules split open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds. Melandrium sylvestre is also known for its medicinal uses in traditional herbal medicine."
