    "intro": "Medicago sativa var. turkestanica, commonly known as Turkestan alfalfa, is a perennial legume native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a valuable forage crop in dry regions. It has deep taproots that help it survive drought conditions and fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia. This variety is often used in agriculture for livestock feed and soil enrichment due to its high nutritional value and ecological benefits."
