The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats at high altitudes, often in mountainous terrain. Its leaves are usually lanceolate or ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Microula sikkimensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to alpine environments and its potential ecological significance in mountain ecosystems."
