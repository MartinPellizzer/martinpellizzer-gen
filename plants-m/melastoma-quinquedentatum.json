    "intro": "Melastoma quinquedentatum, commonly known as the five-tooth melastoma, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with five distinct teeth along the margins. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or red, with five petals and five stamens. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release small, dark seeds. Melastoma quinquedentatum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and shrublands."
