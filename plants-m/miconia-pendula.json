    "intro": "Miconia pendula, commonly known as the weeping miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by distinctive, showy orange-red fruits. Its growth habit is typically pendulous, with branches drooping gracefully, giving it a weeping appearance. Miconia pendula is often cultivated for its ornamental value in tropical gardens."
