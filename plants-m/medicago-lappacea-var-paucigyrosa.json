    "intro": "Medicago lappacea var. paucigyrosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces elongated, cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a valuable forage plant for livestock in dry regions. Its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil also contributes to soil fertility and ecological balance."
