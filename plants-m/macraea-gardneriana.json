    "intro": "Macraea gardneriana, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to eastern and southern Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and glossy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing elliptical seeds. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in furniture and musical instruments. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
