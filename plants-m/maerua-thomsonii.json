    "intro": "Maerua thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's maerua, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its woody stems are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fuel. Maerua thomsonii is adapted to survive in harsh environments, making it an important component of local ecosystems."
