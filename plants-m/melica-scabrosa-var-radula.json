    "intro": "Melica scabrosa var. radula, commonly known as rough brome, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows, prairies, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers. This variety is characterized by its rough, scabrous texture, which gives it its scientific name."
