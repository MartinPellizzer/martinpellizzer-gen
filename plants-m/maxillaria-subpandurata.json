    "intro": "Maxillaria subpandurata, commonly known as the Pandurata orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, hooded lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. It blooms during the late summer to early autumn season, and its flowers are often short-lived but highly attractive to pollinators. The species is relatively easy to cultivate, making it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
