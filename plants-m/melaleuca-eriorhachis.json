    "intro": "Melaleuca eriorhachis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, white, peeling bark that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. It produces small, pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, urn-shaped fruit. Melaleuca eriorhachis is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value."
