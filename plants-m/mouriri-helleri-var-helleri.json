    "intro": "Mouriri helleri var. helleri, commonly known as the Heller's mouriri, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It features glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for certain wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
