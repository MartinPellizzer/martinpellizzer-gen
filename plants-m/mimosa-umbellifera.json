    "intro": "Mimosa umbellifera, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in light or touch. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Mimosa umbellifera is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
