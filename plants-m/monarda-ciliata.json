    "intro": "Monarda ciliata, commonly known as the fringed blazing star, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its tall, spiky flower spikes that bloom in shades of red, purple, and pink. The plant has aromatic leaves that are often covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, and its stems are square in cross-section, a common trait in the mint family. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in prairies, meadows, and open woodlands. Monarda ciliata is valued for its ornamental beauty and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
