    "intro": "Microchilus quadratus, commonly known as the four-sided moss, is a small, terrestrial moss species belonging to the family Dicranaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive quadrangular stem structure, which gives it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are linear and often arranged in a spiral, with a smooth, glossy surface. Microchilus quadratus plays a vital role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its native habitats."
