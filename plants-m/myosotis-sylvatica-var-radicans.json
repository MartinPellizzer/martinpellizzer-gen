    "intro": "Myosotis sylvatica var. radicans, commonly known as the trailing forget-me-not, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or gravelly ground. The plant produces clusters of small, sky-blue flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This variety is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and visual charm."
