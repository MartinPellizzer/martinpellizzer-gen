    "intro": "Medicago falcata var. procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate sickle vetch, is a low-growing annual legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features trifoliate leaves with a distinctive sickle-shaped leaflet, and its flowers are typically pale yellow to pink, arranged in dense spikes. The plant has a sprawling growth habit, often forming a dense mat on the ground. It is well adapted to dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment in ecological restoration projects."
