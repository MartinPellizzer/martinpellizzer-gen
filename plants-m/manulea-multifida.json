It is characterized by its distinctive, branched stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, adding ornamental value to its appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a sunny to partially shaded environment. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native habitat."
