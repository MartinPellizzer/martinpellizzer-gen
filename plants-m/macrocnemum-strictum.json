    "intro": "Macrocnemum strictum, commonly known as the rigid knotted grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often covered with fine hairs, and its leaves are narrow, linear, and arranged alternately along the stem. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are clustered in groups, with small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
