    "intro": "Muellera sanctae-marthae, commonly known as the sacred muellera, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are usually elliptical with a slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, white or pale pink blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
