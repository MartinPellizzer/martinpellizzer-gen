It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, small flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant prefers humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its conservation status is threatened due to habitat destruction and limited distribution. Microchilus dasilvae is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological niche."
