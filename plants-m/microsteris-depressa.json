    "intro": "Microsteris depressa, commonly known as the dwarf microsteris, is a small, flowering plant native to the southern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and thrives in open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are small and clustered in a composite head. Microsteris depressa is often overlooked due to its modest size but plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
