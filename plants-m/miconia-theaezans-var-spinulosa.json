    "intro": "Miconia theaezans var. spinulosa, commonly known as the spiny miconia, is a shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Its growth habit is typically upright, with branches that can become somewhat woody over time. The spiny miconia is known for its ornamental value but can also be invasive in certain environments."
