    "intro": "Medicago denticulata var. apiculata, commonly known as the slender medick, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, grasslands, and along waterways. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
