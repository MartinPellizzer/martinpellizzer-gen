    "intro": "Murdannia stictosperma, commonly known as the narrowleaf marsh grass, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marsh environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Commelinaceae, which includes plants with diverse growth forms and adaptations to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial with slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, clustered inflorescences bear white or pale pink flowers, which are pollinated by wind or insects. The seeds are enclosed in small, capsule-like fruits that disperse via water or wind, aiding in the plant's spread across wetland ecosystems."
