    "intro": "Mikania steinbachii, commonly known as the creeping oxeye, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rapid growth and sprawling habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers surrounded by white ray florets, which are typical of the daisy family. Its leaves are opposite, heart-shaped, and often have a hairy texture. Mikania steinbachii is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas."
