It features a globular or cylindrical stem covered in white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for succulent collections."
