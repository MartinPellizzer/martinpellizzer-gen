    "intro": "Maranta grandis, commonly known as the velvetleaf arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant belongs to the Marantaceae family, which includes many ornamental plants known for their vibrant foliage. Its rhizomes are used as a starchy food source in some regions, similar to arrowroot. Maranta grandis thrives in humid, shady environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and indoor spaces."
