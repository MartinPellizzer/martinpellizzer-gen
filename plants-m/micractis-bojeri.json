    "intro": "Micractis bojeri, commonly known as the Bojer's sea urchin, is a species of echinoderm found in the Indo-Pacific region. It belongs to the family Diadematidae and is characterized by its spiny, spherical body covered in calcareous plates. The plant, more accurately a marine invertebrate, exhibits a unique radial symmetry with long, sharp spines that serve as both a defense mechanism and a means of locomotion. Its habitat typically includes coral reefs and rocky substrates where it can find shelter and food. Micractis bojeri plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to the structure of reef habitats and serving as a food source for various predators."
