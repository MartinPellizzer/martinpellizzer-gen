    "intro": "Macropodium pterospermum, commonly known as the broad-leafed tamarind, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in a pinnate pattern, and its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces elongated pods containing seeds enclosed in a fibrous, woody husk. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland forests or along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
