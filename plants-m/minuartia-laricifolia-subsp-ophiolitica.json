    "intro": "Minuartia laricifolia subsp. ophiolitica, commonly known as the Alpine rock-cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of the European Alps and other mountainous areas. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes."
