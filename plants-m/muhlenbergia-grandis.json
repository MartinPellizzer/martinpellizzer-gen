    "intro": "Muhlenbergia grandis, commonly known as the giant muhlenbergia, is a tall, perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color and can grow up to 2 to 3 meters in height. The plant produces delicate, panicle-like inflorescences that bloom with small, spikelet flowers in late summer. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to thrive with minimal water and maintenance."
