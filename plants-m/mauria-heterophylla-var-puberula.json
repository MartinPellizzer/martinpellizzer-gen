    "intro": "Mauria heterophylla var. puberula, commonly known as the roughleaf marshplant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of southern Australia. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with some leaves being broad and others narrow, and its hairy surface that gives it the \"puberula\" designation. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soils, and its flowers are small, clustered, and often pink or white in color. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
