    "intro": "Mammillaria sartorii f. longispina, commonly known as the long-spined mammillaria, is a compact cactus with a globular shape and a gray-green to blueish color. It features numerous radial spines that are longer and more pronounced than those of the typical species, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, round fruits. It is native to Mexico and thrives in well-draining soil with minimal water. This variety is popular among cactus enthusiasts for its unique spination and ease of cultivation."
