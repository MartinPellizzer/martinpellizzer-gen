    "intro": "Maytenus pruinosa, commonly known as the silver mayten, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery bloom, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in humid, lowland areas. Maytenus pruinosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some indigenous cultures."
