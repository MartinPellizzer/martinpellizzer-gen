    "intro": "Monochaetum vulcanicum, commonly known as the Vulcan Island spikegrass, is a rare grass species endemic to the volcanic island of Vulcano in Italy. It is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and slender, hairless blades that are typically less than 10 cm in height. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, white flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to the unique microclimate of its volcanic habitat. Due to its limited distribution and fragile ecosystem, it is considered a vulnerable species."
