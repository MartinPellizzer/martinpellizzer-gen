    "intro": "Micropolypodium basiattenuatum, commonly known as the narrow-attenuated polypody, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It has delicate, linear leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length, with a distinctive base that tapers gradually. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered near the margins. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its botanical features make it a unique subject for study in tropical botany and conservation efforts."
