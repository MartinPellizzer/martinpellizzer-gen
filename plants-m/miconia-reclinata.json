    "intro": "Miconia reclinata, commonly known as the hanging miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, followed by distinctive, round, fleshy fruits. Its growth habit is typically upright, with a dense canopy that provides shade in its natural habitat. Miconia reclinata is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along riverbanks."
