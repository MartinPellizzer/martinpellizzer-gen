    "intro": "Minuartia ebracteolata, commonly known as the naked-bract rockcress, is a small, mat-forming flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with densely packed, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in tight, spherical inflorescences. It is typically found in rocky or gravelly habitats, often in alpine or arctic regions. Due to its specialized growth conditions, it is a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
