    "intro": "Molkenboeria striata, commonly known as the striped milkweed, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming from late winter to early spring. Its milky sap, which gives it its common name, is a distinguishing feature and can be toxic if ingested. Molkenboeria striata thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats."
