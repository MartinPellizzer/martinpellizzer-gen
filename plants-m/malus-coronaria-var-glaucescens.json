    "intro": "Malus coronaria var. glaucescens, commonly known as the glaucous flowering crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It features showy, single or clustered white or pink flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a glossy, bluish-green upper surface and a lighter, often whitish underside. The fruit is a small, yellow or orange-red pome that matures in late summer. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its spring blooms and autumn color."
