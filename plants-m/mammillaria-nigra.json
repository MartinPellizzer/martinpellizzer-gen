    "intro": "Mammillaria nigra, commonly known as the black mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense covering of small, white spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to dry conditions. Mammillaria nigra is well-suited for cultivation in well-draining soil and full sun."
