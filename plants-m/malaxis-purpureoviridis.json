    "intro": "Malaxis purpureoviridis, commonly known as the purple-green orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Malaxis purpureoviridis is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is valued for its unique floral structure and ecological role in its native habitat."
