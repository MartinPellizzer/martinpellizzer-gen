    "intro": "Melica transsilvanica, commonly known as Transylvanian grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, particularly found in the Carpathian region. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Melica transsilvanica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
