    "intro": "Melaleuca fasciculiflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia, particularly in Queensland and New South Wales, where it thrives in coastal and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels off in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, white flowers are clustered in spikes and bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. The leaves are narrow and leathery, often arranged in dense clusters along the stems."
