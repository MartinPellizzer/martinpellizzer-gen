It features opposite, ovate leaves with a serrated margin and a distinctive reddish or purple underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in whorled clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Mentha divaricata is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a slightly sour taste and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
