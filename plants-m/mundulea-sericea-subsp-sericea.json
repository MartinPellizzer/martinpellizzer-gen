    "intro": "Mundulea sericea subsp. sericea, commonly known as the silky acacia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, feathery leaves that give it a silky appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, woody pods containing seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with low rainfall. This subspecies is often used in traditional medicine and for soil stabilization in degraded landscapes."
