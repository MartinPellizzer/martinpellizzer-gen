    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum kolbei, commonly known as the Cape gooseberry or physalis, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, a characteristic adaptation to its arid habitat. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that open in the morning and close at night. Its fruit is a rounded, spiky structure that encloses a cluster of small, edible seeds. Mesembryanthemum kolbei is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
