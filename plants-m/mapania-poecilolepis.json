It is characterized by its opposite, palmate leaves that are typically five to seven lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish, with a slightly rough texture as it ages. Mapania poecilolepis is often found in lowland forests and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance."
