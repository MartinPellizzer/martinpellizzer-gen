    "intro": "Muehlenbeckia muricatula, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to New Zealand. It features wiry, sprawling stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters during the spring. Its leaves are narrow, slightly hairy, and have a silvery-blue hue due to fine pubescence. Muehlenbeckia muricatula thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine habitats."
