    "intro": "Macrocarpaea noctiluca, commonly known as the night-lit plant, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent flowers that glow faintly in the dark, a unique adaptation that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically ovate and have a slightly hairy texture. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in supporting night-active insects."
