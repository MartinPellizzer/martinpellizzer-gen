It is characterized by its dense, glossy foliage with leaves that are elliptical and often resemble those of boxwood plants. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by orange-red berries, which are a food source for various birds. Maytenus buxifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments. It has also been studied for potential medicinal properties due to the presence of bioactive compounds in its leaves and bark."
