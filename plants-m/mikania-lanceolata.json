    "intro": "Mikania lanceolata, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a vine native to the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in many regions."
