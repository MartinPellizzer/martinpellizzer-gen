    "intro": "Myriophyllum verticillatum var. limosum, commonly known as narrow-leaved watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to North America. It features whorled leaves that are narrow and ribbon-like, often with a slight serration along the edges. The plant produces small, green flowers that are typically found in clusters near the water surface. It thrives in freshwater lakes and ponds with moderate to slow water flow. This species is often considered an invasive plant in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats."
