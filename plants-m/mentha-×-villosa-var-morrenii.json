    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 villosa var. morrenii, commonly known as Morren's hairy mint, is a hybrid perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and aromatic, often fuzzy foliage that distinguishes it from other mint species. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorled clusters, typical of the Lamiaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is cultivated in gardens and herbal medicine practices."
