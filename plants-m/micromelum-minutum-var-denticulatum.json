    "intro": "Micromelum minutum var. denticulatum, commonly known as the fine-leaved starfruit tree, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with finely serrated margins, which give it its specific epithet \"denticulatum.\" The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by yellow, star-shaped fruits resembling those of the common starfruit. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in moist, shaded environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural gardens."
