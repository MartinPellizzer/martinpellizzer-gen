    "intro": "Minuartia recurva subsp. carica, commonly known as the rock cress, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Brassicaceae. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, often found in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine layer of white powdery wax, a characteristic feature of many members of the Brassicaceae family. This subspecies is well adapted to harsh, dry conditions and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in landscaping."
