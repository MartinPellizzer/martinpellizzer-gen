    "intro": "Miltoniastrum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a terrestrial orchid with a unique appearance, featuring delicate, white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant has a short, slender stem and lacks leaves, relying instead on its roots for nutrient absorption. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on the forest floor or in swampy areas. Due to its limited habitat and specific ecological requirements, Miltoniastrum is considered a critically endangered species."
