    "intro": "Meliosma tepuiensis, commonly known as the tepui meliosma, is a rare flowering plant native to the tepuis of South America. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and other tropical trees. The plant is characterized by its small, white or greenish flowers and is typically found in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a rough texture that helps it retain moisture in its high-altitude habitat. Due to its restricted distribution and fragile ecosystem, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
