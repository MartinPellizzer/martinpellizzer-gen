    "intro": "Medicago polymorpha var. ciliaris, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant characterized by its trifoliate leaves and hairy stems. It is native to Europe and Asia but has been introduced to various parts of the world, including North America. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers and flat, elliptical pods that contain several seeds. It is often used as a cover crop due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Its adaptability to different soil types and climate conditions makes it a valuable plant in agricultural and ecological settings."
