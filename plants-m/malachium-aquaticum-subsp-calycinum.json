    "intro": "Malachium aquaticum subsp. calycinum, commonly known as water hemp-nettle, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Due to its aquatic nature, it plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
