    "intro": "Messerschmidia piliochros, commonly known as the purple ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers, which are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its small, delicate leaves are adapted to capture moisture from the humid air. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species."
