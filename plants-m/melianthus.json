    "intro": "Melianthus, commonly known as the \"wild bean\" or \"southern flame,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to southern Africa and features showy, often red or orange, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like birds and insects. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with compound leaves and woody stems. Its flowers are followed by pods that contain edible seeds, which can be used in traditional cuisine. Melianthus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other regions for horticultural purposes."
