    "intro": "Monotropsis reynoldsiae, commonly known as Reynolds' ghost plant, is a rare and unique parasitic plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it unable to perform photosynthesis. Instead, it derives nutrients from its host fungi through a process called mycorrhizal association. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale green, and it has a short, creeping stem with small, scale-like leaves. Due to its specialized lifestyle and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
