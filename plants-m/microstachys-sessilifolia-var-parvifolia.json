    "intro": "Microstachys sessilifolia var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved evergreen shrub, is a variant of the species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are typically sessile, meaning they lack a stem and attach directly to the stem. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences bearing tiny, white to pale pink flowers. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its foliage is valued for its dense, evergreen appearance, making it a popular ornamental plant in tropical gardens."
