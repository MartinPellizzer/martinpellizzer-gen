    "intro": "Medicago uncinata, commonly known as goat's rue, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces pods that contain seeds with hooked tips, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands. Medicago uncinata is also known for its historical use in traditional medicine."
