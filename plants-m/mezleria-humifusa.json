    "intro": "Mezleria humifusa, commonly known as the creeping mezleria, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically forms dense mats of foliage close to the ground, with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover. Mezleria humifusa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in rocky or dry environments."
