    "intro": "Melica lobelii, commonly known as the bluegrass or slender false brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Melica lobelii is typically found in moist meadows, stream banks, and other wetland habitats. Its ecological importance includes providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing soil in its native environments."
