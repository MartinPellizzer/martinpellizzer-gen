    "intro": "Merophragma terrestre, commonly known as the terrestrial merophragma, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. Native to specific regions in South America, it thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid forests or along riverbanks. The plant exhibits a unique adaptation of storing water in its leaves, which helps it survive in its often-dry habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
