    "intro": "Mentha aquatica var. subthermalis, commonly known as the subthermal water mint, is a variant of the water mint species native to temperate regions. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves and clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. Its leaves are often used in herbal teas and traditional medicine for their cooling properties. The plant's subspecies status reflects its adaptation to slightly warmer climates compared to the standard Mentha aquatica."
