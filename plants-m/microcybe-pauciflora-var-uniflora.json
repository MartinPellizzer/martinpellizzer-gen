    "intro": "Microcybe pauciflora var. uniflora, commonly known as the single-flowered microcybe, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its flowers are typically pale green or white, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
