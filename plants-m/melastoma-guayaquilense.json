    "intro": "Melastoma guayaquilense, commonly known as the Guayaquil melastoma, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Colombia. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and it often grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and understoreys. Its fruit is a capsule that disperses seeds through wind, contributing to its natural spread in the wild. Melastoma guayaquilense is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
