    "intro": "Meliosma pinnata subsp. barbulata, commonly known as the hairy-leafed meliosma, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bignoniaceae. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves with a hairy underside, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded, moist environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in terminal inflorescences, and are typically yellow or greenish in color. The subspecies is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its foliage rather than its flowers."
