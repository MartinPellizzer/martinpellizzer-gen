    "intro": "Mucuna utilis, commonly known as the velvet bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its dense, velvety pubescence on its stems and leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by pods containing flat, bean-like seeds. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. Mucuna utilis is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing capabilities and use in traditional agriculture."
