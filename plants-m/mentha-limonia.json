    "intro": "Mentha limonia, commonly known as the lemon mint, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often fragrant. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorls along the stem, typical of the Lamiaceae family. Its aromatic foliage emits a distinct lemony scent, which is due to the presence of volatile oils such as citral and limonene. Mentha limonia is often used in culinary and medicinal applications for its refreshing flavor and potential health benefits."
