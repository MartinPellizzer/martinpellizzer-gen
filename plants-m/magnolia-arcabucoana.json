It is characterized by its large, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
