    "intro": "Myrrhis australis, commonly known as the Australian sweetflag, is a perennial herb native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Myrrhis australis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
