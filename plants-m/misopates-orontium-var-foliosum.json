    "intro": "Misopates orontium var. foliosum, commonly known as the broadleaf watercress, is a flowering plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features small, alternate leaves that are typically broad and ovate, with a succulent texture. The plant produces tiny white or greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found near streams or in flooded fields. Due to its aquatic habitat, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and microorganisms."
