It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces distinctive, finely divided leaves that are often aromatic. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
