    "intro": "Marsippospermum gracile var. novae-zelandiae, commonly known as the New Zealand slender mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of native New Zealand trees. It has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or pink flowers that are often clustered together. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients but can photosynthesize to some extent. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fleshy, red berries. This species is endemic to New Zealand and is considered a rare and vulnerable plant."
