    "intro": "Myosotis palustris var. orbelica, commonly known as the marsh forget-me-not, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, sky-blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense colonies in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting aquatic and wetland ecosystems."
