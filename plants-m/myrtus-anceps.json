    "intro": "Myrtus anceps, commonly known as the narrowleaf myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features aromatic, narrow lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue berries. Myrtus anceps is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and traditional herbal uses."
