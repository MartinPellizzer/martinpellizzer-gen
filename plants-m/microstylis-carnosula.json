It belongs to the family Restionaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen appearance. The plant features dense, fleshy stems that store water, an adaptation to its often arid environment. Its small, clustered flowers are typically white or pale pink, adding ornamental value. It is often grown as a succulent in gardens due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
