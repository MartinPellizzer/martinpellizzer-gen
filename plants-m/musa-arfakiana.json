    "intro": "Musa arfakiana, commonly known as the Arfak mountain banana, is a species native to the highlands of New Guinea. It is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Musaceae family, characterized by its large, elongated leaves and clustered inflorescences. The plant produces edible fruits that are typically small and have a fibrous texture. It thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less commonly cultivated banana species."
