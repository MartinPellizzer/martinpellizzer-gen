    "intro": "Mondo longifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mondo grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features dense, clumping foliage with narrow, dark green leaves that form a compact mat. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in late spring, which are followed by bright red berries. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to suppress weeds. Mondo longifolium is also valued for its ability to tolerate various soil types and its low maintenance requirements."
