    "intro": "Muscari mordoanum, commonly known as the Persian grape hyacinth, is a bulbous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It produces dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet, resembling grapes. The plant typically grows to a height of 15\u201330 cm and is well-suited for rock gardens or borders due to its compact size. Its foliage consists of strap-like leaves that emerge in early spring, followed by the flowering period in late spring. Muscari mordoanum is perennial and prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade."
