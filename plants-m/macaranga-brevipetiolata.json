    "intro": "Macaranga brevipetiolata, commonly known as the short-stemmed paper mulberry, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas make it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
