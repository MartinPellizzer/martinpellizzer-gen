    "intro": "Mentha aquatica var. verticillata, commonly known as water mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are often aromatic. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers arranged in whorls, which give it its common name \"verticillata,\" meaning \"wheel-like.\" It thrives in moist soils and is often found near streams, ponds, and marshes. This variety is closely related to other mint species and is valued for its medicinal and culinary uses."
