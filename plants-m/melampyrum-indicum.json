It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and the flowers are clustered in spikes. Melampyrum indicum is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
