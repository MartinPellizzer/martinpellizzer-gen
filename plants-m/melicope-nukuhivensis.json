    "intro": "Melicope nukuhivensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian melicope, is a member of the Rutaceae family and is native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub characterized by its aromatic, rough-textured bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats, often found in mesic to wet forest environments. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
