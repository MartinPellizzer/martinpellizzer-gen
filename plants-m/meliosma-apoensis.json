It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and other tropical trees. The plant is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in the early morning. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, it is considered a vulnerable species."
