    "intro": "Mandarus, commonly known as the rock rose, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rosaceae. It consists of about 30 species, predominantly found in the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia. The plants are typically shrubs with thorny stems and showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. They produce small, red or orange berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. Mandarus species are often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to their hardy nature and attractive blooms."
