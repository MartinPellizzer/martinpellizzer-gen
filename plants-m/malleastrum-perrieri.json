    "intro": "Malleastrum perrieri, commonly known as the Perrier's malleastrum, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and showy, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and prefers full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
