    "intro": "Minuartia recurva subsp. oreina, commonly known as the Alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant typically has a mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. Its flowers are usually white or pink, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems. This subspecies is notable for its resilience to cold temperatures and its ability to colonize exposed, nutrient-poor substrates."
