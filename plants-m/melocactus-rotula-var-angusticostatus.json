    "intro": "Melocactus rotula var. angusticostatus, commonly known as the narrow-ribbed melocactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem, which is covered in prominent, angular ribs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces a single, spiny areole with a dense cluster of white to yellowish hairs. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing at the top of the stem during the spring and summer months. This variety is well adapted to hot, dry environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
