    "intro": "Melica secunda var. interrupta, commonly known as the interrupted brome, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and stream banks. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that often lie close to the ground, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of small, two-lobed spikelets. This variant is distinguished by its interrupted flowering pattern, where some spikelets are absent, giving it its common name."
