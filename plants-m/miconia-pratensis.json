    "intro": "Miconia pratensis, commonly known as the swamp miconia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in wetlands and swampy areas, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually white or pale pink, and it is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets. Miconia pratensis is also notable for its ecological impact, as it can become invasive in certain areas."
