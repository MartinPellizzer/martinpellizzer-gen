    "intro": "Mitracarpus microspermus, commonly known as the small-seeded mitracarpus, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and umbel-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are minute and dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution in open, sunny habitats. The species is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy or well-drained soils."
