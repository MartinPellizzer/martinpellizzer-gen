    "intro": "Malaxis oligantha, commonly known as the slender malaxis, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in shades of green and white. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor, and it is often found in association with other epiphytic orchids. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
