    "intro": "Mollinedia canfieldiae, commonly known as the Canfield's molly, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces delicate, white to pale purple flowers during the spring and early summer. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to its specific ecological niche and its role in local biodiversity. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern."
