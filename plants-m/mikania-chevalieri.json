    "intro": "Mikania chevalieri, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a vigorous climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
