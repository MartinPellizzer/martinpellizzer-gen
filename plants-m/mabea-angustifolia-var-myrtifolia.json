It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or swampy areas. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for ecological studies and ornamental gardening."
