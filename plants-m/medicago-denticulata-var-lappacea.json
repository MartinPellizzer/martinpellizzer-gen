    "intro": "Medicago denticulata var. lappacea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves with a distinctive serrated edge, and its pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is often found in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. This makes it an important plant for soil enrichment and a forage crop for livestock."
