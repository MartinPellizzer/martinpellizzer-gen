    "intro": "Melilotoides archiducis-nicolai, commonly known as the Archduke Nicholas melilot, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its pod-bearing fruits and nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
