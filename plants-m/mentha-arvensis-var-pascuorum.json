It typically grows in moist, grassy areas and has a creeping growth habit with rhizomes that allow it to spread rapidly. The leaves are lance-shaped, aromatic, and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are small, tubular, and usually pink or purple in color. It is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils. This variety is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
