    "intro": "Myriophyllum verticillatum subsp. intermedium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to North America. It has whorled leaves that are typically narrow and elongated, with a smooth surface and a pointed tip. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense, umbrella-like inflorescences. It thrives in freshwater lakes and slow-moving rivers, often forming dense mats that can impact water quality and aquatic habitats. Its rapid growth and ability to reproduce vegetatively make it an invasive species in some regions."
