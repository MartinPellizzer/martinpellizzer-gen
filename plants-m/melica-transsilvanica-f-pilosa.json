    "intro": "Melica transsilvanica f. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy meadowgrass, is a variant of the species Melica transsilvanica, characterized by its dense, hairy foliage. It is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in moist meadows and along stream banks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 60 cm in height, and its leaves are narrow with a rough texture. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lipped flowers, which are typically greenish or pale blue in color. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
