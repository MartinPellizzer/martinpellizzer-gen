    "intro": "Melaleuca empetrifolia, commonly known as the stone gum, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to the eastern coast of Australia, where it typically grows in sandy soils along coastal areas. The plant is characterized by its rough, flaky bark that resembles stone, hence its common name. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, often with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters. The stone gum is known for its hardiness and ability to thrive in harsh coastal environments."
