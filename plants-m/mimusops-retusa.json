It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub that typically grows up to 6 meters in height. The plant is characterized by its dense clusters of white, waxy flowers that bloom in spring, giving it a snowball-like appearance. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a rough texture. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds."
