    "intro": "Mahonia volcania, commonly known as the volcanic mahonia, is a shrub native to the volcanic regions of Central America. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with holly-like leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in the spring, which are clustered in upright panicles. These flowers are followed by blue-black berries that are edible but have a tart flavor. Mahonia volcania thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to partially sunny environments."
