It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense, feathery foliage and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine, velvety texture, giving it its common name.
