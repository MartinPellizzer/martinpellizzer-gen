    "intro": "Mimosa aemula, commonly known as the silver mimosa, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait known as thigmonasty. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Mimosa aemula is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plants."
