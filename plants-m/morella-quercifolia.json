    "intro": "Morella quercifolia, commonly known as the beaked hazel, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its alternate, ovate leaves with serrated margins and a distinctive beak-like tip. The plant produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, which are essential for wind pollination. Its fruit is a small, winged nut enclosed in a spiny husk, typical of the Corylaceae family. Morella quercifolia is often found in moist, acidic soils along stream banks and in wetlands."
