    "intro": "Mentha longifolia var. discolor, commonly known as wild mint, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, square stems and opposite, serrated leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a silvery underside. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils that contribute to its minty fragrance and are used in culinary and medicinal applications. This variety is often found in woodland edges and moist soils, thriving in partial shade to full sun."
