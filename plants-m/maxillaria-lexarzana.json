    "intro": "Maxillaria lexarzana, commonly known as the Mexican lady's slipper orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety pink and white flowers that resemble a lady's slipper, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, and the plant produces greenish-yellow pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Maxillaria lexarzana is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
