    "intro": "Micranthemum rotundatum, commonly known as roundleaf watermoss, is a small aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are often less than 1 cm in diameter, arranged in whorls around the stems. It produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or white, and it is often used in aquariums due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions. Micranthemum rotundatum is also valued for its role in aquatic ecosystems, providing habitat and oxygenation for various aquatic organisms."
