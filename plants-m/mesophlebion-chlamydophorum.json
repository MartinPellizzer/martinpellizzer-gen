It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant's leaves are covered in a fine, waxy layer that helps retain moisture and protect against excessive sunlight. Its reproductive structures are small and clustered, producing spores rather than seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
