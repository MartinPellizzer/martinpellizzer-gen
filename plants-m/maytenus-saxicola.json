    "intro": "Maytenus saxicola, commonly known as the rock mayten, is a small evergreen shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers followed by small, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it survive in poor soil and low moisture conditions. Maytenus saxicola plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky and degraded landscapes."
