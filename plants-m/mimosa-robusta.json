    "intro": "Mimosa robusta, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a tropical shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and summer. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil. Mimosa robusta is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions."
