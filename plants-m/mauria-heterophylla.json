    "intro": "Mauria heterophylla, commonly known as the variable leaf marram, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its ability to produce leaves of varying shapes and sizes, which is an adaptation to its harsh, windy coastal environment. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or on cliff faces. Its small, white or pinkish flowers appear in summer, and it plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes through its extensive root system. Mauria heterophylla is a hardy species that thrives in saline and well-drained conditions."
