It is characterized by its large, showy, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The leaves are broad, ovate, and have a velvety texture, giving the plant its common name. The bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas."
