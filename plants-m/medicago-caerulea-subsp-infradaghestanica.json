    "intro": "Medicago caerulea subsp. infradaghestanica, commonly known as the Caucasian blue clover, is a perennial legume native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, sky-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability. This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations to its environment."
