It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale pink. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is often found in montane forests and requires a humid climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
