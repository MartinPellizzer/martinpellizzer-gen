    "intro": "Myrmecophila mirabilis, commonly known as the sacred lotus of the Amazon, is a striking aquatic plant native to South America. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant produces showy pink or red flowers that bloom above the water, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the muddy bottom of slow-moving rivers and lakes. Myrmecophila mirabilis plays a vital role in the ecosystem by supporting biodiversity and maintaining water quality."
