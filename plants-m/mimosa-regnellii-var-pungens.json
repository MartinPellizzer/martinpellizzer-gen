    "intro": "Mimosa regnellii var. pungens, commonly known as the spiny mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is known for its sensitive leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait called thigmonastic response. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
