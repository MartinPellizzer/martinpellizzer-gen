    "intro": "Marcetia taxifolia var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi- to tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant's leaves are covered in small, glandular dots, which contribute to its distinctive texture and may play a role in water retention. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
