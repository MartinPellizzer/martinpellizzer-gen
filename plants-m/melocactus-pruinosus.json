    "intro": "Melocactus pruinosus, commonly known as the velvet melon cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its short, columnar stem that is covered in a dense, powdery coating, giving it a distinctive velvety appearance. The plant produces large, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in the evening. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Melocactus pruinosus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
