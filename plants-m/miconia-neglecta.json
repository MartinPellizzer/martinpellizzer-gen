    "intro": "Miconia neglecta, commonly known as the little miconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange to red berries. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it an invasive species in some regions. Miconia neglecta is often found in disturbed habitats and can thrive in a variety of soil types."
