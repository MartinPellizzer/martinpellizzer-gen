    "intro": "Mammillaria winkleri, commonly known as the Winkler's bunny ear cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It features a globular or cylindrical stem with white, woolly hairs that help reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
