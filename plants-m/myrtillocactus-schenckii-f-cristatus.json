    "intro": "Myrtillocactus schenckii f. cristatus, commonly known as the crested myrtillocactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its unique, flattened, and often branched growth form. The plant features a thick, ribbed stem covered in small, spiny areoles, and it produces vibrant purple or blue flowers during the spring. Its crinkled, almost fern-like appearance is due to its naturally occurring cresting mutation, which makes it highly sought after by collectors. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments."
