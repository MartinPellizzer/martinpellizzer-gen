    "intro": "Mikania holmesiana, commonly known as the Holmes' morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its trumpet-shaped, vibrant blue to purple flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces small, fluffy seed heads that disperse its seeds easily. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
