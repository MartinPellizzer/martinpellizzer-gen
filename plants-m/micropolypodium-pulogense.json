    "intro": "Micropolypodium pulogense, commonly known as the Pulo Gunung fern, is a small epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows on tree trunks and branches in humid, shaded environments. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves with a leathery texture and is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are surrounded by a protective indusium. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
