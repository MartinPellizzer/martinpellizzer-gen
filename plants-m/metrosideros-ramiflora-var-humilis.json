    "intro": "Metrosideros ramiflora var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf flame tree, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its bright red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often appearing in late winter to early spring. The leaves are lance-shaped and glossy, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant floral display. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal gardens. This variety is less common than its parent species, Metrosideros ramiflora, and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
