It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale blue to white flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
