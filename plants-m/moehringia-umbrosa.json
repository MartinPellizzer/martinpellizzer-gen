    "intro": "Moehringia umbrosa, commonly known as the shadowy moehringia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky stream banks. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces delicate, white or pale blue flowers in late spring. Its flowering stems are usually short and often lie close to the ground. Moehringia umbrosa is characterized by its compact growth habit and its ability to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in its native habitat."
