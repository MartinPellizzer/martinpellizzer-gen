It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous regions. The plant features slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a compact spike of small, two-rowed spikelets. Melica baetica is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for invertebrates."
