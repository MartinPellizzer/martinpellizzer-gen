    "intro": "Mikania deltoides, commonly known as the creeping oxeye, is a vigorous perennial vine native to the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and forest edges. Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions."
