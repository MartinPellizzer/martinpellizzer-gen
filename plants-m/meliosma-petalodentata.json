    "intro": "Meliosma petalodentata, commonly known as the petal-toothed meliosma, is a species of flowering plant in the family Meliaceae. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically five-lobed and have a distinctive, almost toothed margin. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually greenish-yellow in color, arranged in clusters. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its unique leaf structure and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
