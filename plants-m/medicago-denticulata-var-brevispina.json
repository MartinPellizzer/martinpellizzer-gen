    "intro": "Medicago denticulata var. brevispina, commonly known as the short-spined clover, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and short, spiny stipules. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment and as a forage plant."
