    "intro": "Miconia excelsa, commonly known as the giant miconia, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 50 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers followed by bright orange, fleshy fruits. Miconia excelsa is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, which can dominate local ecosystems. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a problematic species in certain regions."
