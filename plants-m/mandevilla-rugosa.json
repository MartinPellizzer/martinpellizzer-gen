    "intro": "Mandevilla rugosa, commonly known as the rough mandevilla, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and large, velvety leaves that are typically green with a slightly textured surface. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in warm climates and is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens or as a houseplant. Mandevilla rugosa is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it a low-maintenance choice for landscapers and gardeners."
