    "intro": "Mariscus avenicola, commonly known as the coastal grass or sea grass, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow, arranged in spike-like clusters. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, often in areas subject to salt spray. Mariscus avenicola plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
