    "intro": "Melaleuca clarksonii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled pattern of white, pink, and green beneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a reddish or purple hue when young. Melaleuca clarksonii is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it is often found in heathlands and coastal scrub environments."
