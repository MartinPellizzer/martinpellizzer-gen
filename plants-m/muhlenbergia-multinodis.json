    "intro": "Muhlenbergia multinodis, commonly known as the nodding muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the United States, particularly found in the southeastern region. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, arching stems that bear small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces fluffy, white to pale blue plumes that give it a delicate, ornamental appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in open woodlands and along streambanks. Muhlenbergia multinodis is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil, making it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
