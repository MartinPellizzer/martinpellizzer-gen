    "intro": "Muehlenbeckia \u00d7 axephedra, commonly known as silver mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to New Zealand. It features dense, mat-forming growth with silver-gray foliage due to a layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage rather than its flowers."
