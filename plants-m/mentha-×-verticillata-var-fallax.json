    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 verticillata var. fallax, commonly known as autumn mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy and have a minty fragrance. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in whorled clusters, typical of the Mentha genus. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and marshy areas. This variety is noted for its hardy nature and ability to spread through rhizomes, making it a common ornamental and medicinal plant."
