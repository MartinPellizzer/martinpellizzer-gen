    "intro": "Mentha pulegium f. cephalonia, commonly known as narrow-leaved pennyroyal, is a rare horticultural form of the pennyroyal plant. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and strong, aromatic menthol scent. This variety is native to the island of Cephalonia in Greece and thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in herbal remedies. Due to its potent essential oils, it requires careful handling and is not recommended for indoor use."
