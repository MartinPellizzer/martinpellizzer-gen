    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 piperoides, commonly known as catnip, is a hybrid mint species that is native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, serrated leaves that are often a vibrant green or grayish-green. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom in late summer. It is known for its strong aromatic properties, largely due to the presence of the chemical compound nepetalactone. Mentha \u00d7 piperoides is widely cultivated for its use in herbal teas, as a natural insect repellent, and in traditional medicine."
