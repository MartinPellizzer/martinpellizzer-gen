It features feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a characteristic known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Mimosa chinensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
