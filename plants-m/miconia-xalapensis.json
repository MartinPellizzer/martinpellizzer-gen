    "intro": "Miconia xalapensis, commonly known as the Mexican miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the Melastomataceae family. It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white bracts. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions, though it can become invasive in some areas."
