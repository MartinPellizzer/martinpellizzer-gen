    "intro": "Micromeria madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascar thyme, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and umbel-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to the unique environmental conditions of the island. It produces small white or pale pink flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
