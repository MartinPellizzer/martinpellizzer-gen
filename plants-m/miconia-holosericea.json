    "intro": "Miconia holosericea, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically borne in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are fleshy berries that contain numerous small seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in certain regions."
