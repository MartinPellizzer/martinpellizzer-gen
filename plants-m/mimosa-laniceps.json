    "intro": "Mimosa laniceps, commonly known as the woolly mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and leaves that are divided into small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical heads, which are followed by fluffy, pod-like fruits. Mimosa laniceps is adapted to thrive in dry, sunny environments and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. Its unique appearance and ability to withstand harsh conditions make it a notable species in its native habitat."
