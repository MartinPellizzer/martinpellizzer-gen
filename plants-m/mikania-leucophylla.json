    "intro": "Mikania leucophylla, commonly known as white-leaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant is typically found in moist, open habitats such as fields and woodland edges. Its rapid growth and climbing habit make it an invasive species in some regions. The flowers are usually white or pale blue and bloom in the morning, giving it its common name."
