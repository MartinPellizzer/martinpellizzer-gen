    "intro": "Mormolyca lehmanii, commonly known as the Lehman's mormolyca, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky soils, and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are arranged in clusters, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Mormolyca lehmanii is considered a species of conservation concern."
