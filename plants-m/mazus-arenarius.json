    "intro": "Mazus arenarius, commonly known as beach mazus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to harsh maritime conditions. The plant features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, aiding in moisture retention. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. Mazus arenarius plays a role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local biodiversity in coastal ecosystems."
