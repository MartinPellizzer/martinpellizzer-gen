    "intro": "Miconia peltifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers, followed by orange or red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Miconia peltifolia is often found in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests and is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets. Its ecological impact is significant, as it can outcompete native vegetation in invaded areas."
