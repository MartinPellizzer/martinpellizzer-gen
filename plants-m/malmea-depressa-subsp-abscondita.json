    "intro": "Malmea depressa subsp. abscondita, commonly known as the hidden malmea, is a rare and elusive shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
