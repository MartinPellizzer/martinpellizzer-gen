    "intro": "Mimosa quadrivalvis var. floridana, commonly known as the Florida mimosa, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its delicate, feathery foliage and its ability to close its leaves in response to touch, a trait known as thigmonasty. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, followed by flat, pod-like fruits. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along the edges of water bodies. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
