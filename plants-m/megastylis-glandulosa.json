    "intro": "Megastylis glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees. It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. The plant's leaves are typically small, oval, and covered with a waxy cuticle. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, with a distinctive, sticky glandular structure on the petals. The fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains seeds coated in a sticky substance to aid in seed dispersal by animals."
