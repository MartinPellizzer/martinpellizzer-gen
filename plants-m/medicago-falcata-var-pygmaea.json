It is characterized by its small, sickle-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. It has a low-growing habit and is used for erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock. Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh, dry climates."
