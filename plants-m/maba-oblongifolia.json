    "intro": "Maba oblongifolia, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and elliptical, leathery leaves that are often arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species that can survive in poor soil conditions. The sap of Maba oblongifolia is milky and has been used traditionally for various purposes, including as a remedy for skin conditions."
