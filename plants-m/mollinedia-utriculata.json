    "intro": "Mollinedia utriculata, commonly known as the bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, rounded pods that resemble bladders. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas, and it produces tiny white or pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are alternate, lobed, and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched. Mollinedia utriculata is an important plant for pollinators and has been studied for its ecological role in arid ecosystems."
