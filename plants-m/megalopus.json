    "intro": "Megalopus, commonly known as the giant water bug, is a member of the family Belostomatidae. It is characterized by its elongated, flattened body and powerful, raptorial front legs used for capturing prey. The plant-like appearance of its nymphal stage often leads to confusion with aquatic plants. Megalopus thrives in freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. Its life cycle includes aquatic nymphs that undergo several molts before emerging as winged adults."
