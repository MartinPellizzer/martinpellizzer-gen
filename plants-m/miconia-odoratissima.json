    "intro": "Miconia odoratissima, commonly known as the fragrant miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and northern South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its fruit is a bright red, fleshy berry that contains numerous seeds. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in warm climates, though it can become invasive in certain areas."
