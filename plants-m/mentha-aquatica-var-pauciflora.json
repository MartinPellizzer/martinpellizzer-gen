    "intro": "Mentha aquatica var. pauciflora, commonly known as water mint, is a variant of the water mint species native to moist, aquatic environments. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams. Its leaves are often used in herbal teas and traditional medicine for their cooling properties. This variant is less floriferous than the standard water mint, hence its name \"pauciflora,\" meaning \"few-flowered.\""
