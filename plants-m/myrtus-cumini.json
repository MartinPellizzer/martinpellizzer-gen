It is characterized by its aromatic, dark green leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, black, berry-like fruits that are edible and often used in traditional medicine. Myrtus cumini thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant. Its essential oils, extracted from the leaves and flowers, are valued for their aromatic and medicinal properties."
