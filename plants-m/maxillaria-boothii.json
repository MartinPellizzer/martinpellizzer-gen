    "intro": "Maxillaria boothii, commonly known as the Booth's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Caribbean. It features a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a yellow throat. Its leaves are ovate and arranged in two ranks, contributing to its compact appearance. Maxillaria boothii thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
