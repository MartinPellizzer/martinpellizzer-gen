    "intro": "Maba seychellarum, commonly known as Seychellois maba, is a flowering plant native to the Seychelles. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its palm-like appearance with a single trunk and large, paddle-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody fruits containing small, smooth seeds. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
