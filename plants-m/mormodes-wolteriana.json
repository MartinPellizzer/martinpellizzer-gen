It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant features showy, fragrant flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, with intricate patterns on the petals. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. The orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
