    "intro": "Melicytus lanceolatus var. latior, commonly known as the broad-leaved melicytus, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are broader than the typical variety, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. These flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences and are pollinated by insects. The broad-leaved melicytus is often found in coastal and lowland forest habitats, where it thrives in moist, shaded conditions."
