    "intro": "Minuartia montana subsp. montana, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, dark green, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in alpine gardens and rockeries."
