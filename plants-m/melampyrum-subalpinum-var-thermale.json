    "intro": "Melampyrum subalpinum var. thermale, commonly known as the alpine flameflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Alps. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its erect stems and clusters of small, reddish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous climates. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of alpine ecosystem health."
