    "intro": "Megabaria, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Megabaria is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its cultural significance in traditional medicine."
