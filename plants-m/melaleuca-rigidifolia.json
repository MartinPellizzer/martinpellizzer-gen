    "intro": "Melaleuca rigidifolia, commonly known as the rigid-leaved paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia, particularly in Queensland and New South Wales. The plant is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous inner layer, and its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming during the spring and summer months. The plant is well adapted to coastal environments and is often found in sandy soils near the shoreline."
