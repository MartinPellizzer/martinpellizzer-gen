    "intro": "Metathelypteris flaccida var. repens, commonly known as the creeping fern, is a variant of the flaccida fern species. It is a perennial plant characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread along the ground. The fronds are typically slender and arching, with a soft, leathery texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
