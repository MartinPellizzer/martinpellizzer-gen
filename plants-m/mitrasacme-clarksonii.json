    "intro": "Mitrasacme clarksonii, commonly known as the Clarkson's mitrasacme, is a rare flowering plant native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as an understory species, thriving in shaded, moist environments with rich, well-drained soil. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often have a glossy texture, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
