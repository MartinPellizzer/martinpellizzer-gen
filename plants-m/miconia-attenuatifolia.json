    "intro": "Miconia attenuatifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or red miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom throughout the year, followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Its rapid growth and dense foliage make it a popular ornamental plant, though it can become invasive in certain regions. The plant is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
