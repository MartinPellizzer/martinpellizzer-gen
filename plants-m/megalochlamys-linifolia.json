It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a unique structure that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
