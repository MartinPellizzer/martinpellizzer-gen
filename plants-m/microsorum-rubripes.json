    "intro": "Microsorum rubripes, commonly known as the red-veined fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that have a distinctive red vascular pattern visible on the underside. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in shaded, muddy or sandy substrates. Its rhizomes form dense mats, which help stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for small aquatic organisms. Microsorum rubripes is popular in aquariums due to its ornamental appearance and ease of care."
