    "intro": "Moschoxylum cipo, commonly known as the Cipo plant, is a species native to the humid regions of South America, particularly Brazil. It is a shrub that typically grows in dense, shaded environments within the Atlantic Forest ecosystem. The plant features lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, clustered flowers with a distinctive yellowish-green color. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a food source for various native insects and birds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
