It features numerous small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its fleshy, ribbed stem. The plant is native to Mexico and thrives in well-draining soil with minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for succulent enthusiasts. The f. scolymoides form is a hybrid variant, often prized for its ornamental value and compact growth habit."
