    "intro": "Malva oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive serrated margin. The plant produces showy pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy addition to Mediterranean climates. Its fibrous roots and mucilaginous properties have also made it useful in traditional medicine and as a natural emollient."
