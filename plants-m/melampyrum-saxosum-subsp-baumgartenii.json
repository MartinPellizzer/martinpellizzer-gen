    "intro": "Melampyrum saxosum subsp. baumgartenii, commonly known as the saxicola betony, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients. This subspecies is typically found in rocky or gravelly habitats, often in mountainous regions. It produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in spikes, and its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped. The plant is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its specific ecological requirements and limited distribution."
