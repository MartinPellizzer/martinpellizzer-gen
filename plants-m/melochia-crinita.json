It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by distinctive, inflated, spiky fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade, making it adaptable to various tropical environments. Melochia crinita is often used in traditional medicine and as a ornamental plant due to its unique appearance."
