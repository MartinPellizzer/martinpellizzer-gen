    "intro": "Mahonia griffithii, commonly known as Griffith's mahonia, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its compound leaves that are typically evergreen, with dark green, leathery foliage that remains throughout the year. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in upright panicles. These flowers are followed by blue-black berries that are edible for birds but generally unpalatable to humans. Mahonia griffithii is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
