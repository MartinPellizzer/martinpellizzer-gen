    "intro": "Myrcia reticulata, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height. The plant has dark green, glossy leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a slightly serrated edge. Its small, fragrant white flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, orange-red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. The plant is adapted to a variety of soil types and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates."
