    "intro": "Memecylon ultramaficum, commonly known as the ultramafic memecylon, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of pink and white, which attract various pollinators. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils typical of ultramafic areas. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in forest understories and is of interest in ecological and botanical studies."
