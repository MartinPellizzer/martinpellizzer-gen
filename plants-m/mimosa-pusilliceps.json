It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Due to its sensitive foliage, it is often grown as a decorative plant in gardens and greenhouses."
