    "intro": "Mimosa miamensis, commonly known as the Miami mimosa, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are composed of numerous small leaflets arranged in a feather-like pattern. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. Mimosa miamensis is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, which can help improve soil fertility."
