    "intro": "Mespilus oxyacantha subvar. intermedia, commonly known as the middle-eastern medlar, is a lesser-known variant of the medlar species. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to regions of the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen in the autumn, though they are not as widely cultivated as other medlar varieties. Its botanical features include lanceolate leaves with serrated edges and a distinctive, fragrant flower cluster. The subvariety is noted for its adaptability to arid conditions and its potential use in horticulture and traditional medicine."
