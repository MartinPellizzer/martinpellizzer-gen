    "intro": "Macaranga preussii, commonly known as the velvetleaf or African elephant tree, is a tropical plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety layer of hairs. The plant is native to regions across Africa, Asia, and the Pacific, where it thrives in humid, tropical climates. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it a common invasive species in many areas. The plant produces small, greenish flowers followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds."
