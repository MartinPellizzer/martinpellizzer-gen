    "intro": "Monophyllorchis, commonly known as the single-leaf orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a single leaf and a short, erect stem that bears a single spike of flowers. The plant is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Monophyllorchis species typically have small, fragrant flowers that are often white or pale yellow in color. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and less commonly cultivated orchid."
