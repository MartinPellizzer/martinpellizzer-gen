It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are sensitive to touch, causing them to fold when disturbed. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Its unique foliage and adaptability make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant gardens."
