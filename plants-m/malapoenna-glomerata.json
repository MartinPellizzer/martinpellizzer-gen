It belongs to the family Proteaceae, which includes many flowering plants adapted to nutrient-poor soils. The plant is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, providing a drought-resistant feature. Malapoenna glomerata is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and long-lasting blooms."
