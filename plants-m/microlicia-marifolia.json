    "intro": "Microlicia marifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark wood that is highly valued for musical instruments. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. It produces small, white or yellowish flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and protected in many regions."
