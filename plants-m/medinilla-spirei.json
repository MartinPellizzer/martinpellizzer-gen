    "intro": "Medinilla spirei, commonly known as the Spire's Medinilla, is a tropical flowering plant native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green ovate leaves and clusters of fragrant, waxy flowers that range in color from pink to white. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks in its natural habitat. It produces small, round berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Medinilla spirei thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil."
