    "intro": "Matricaria macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved chamomile, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its yellow flower heads and white ray florets. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats and is known for its aromatic, slightly bitter leaves. Its flowers bloom in late summer, and the plant is often used in herbal remedies due to its mild sedative properties. Matricaria macrophylla is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
