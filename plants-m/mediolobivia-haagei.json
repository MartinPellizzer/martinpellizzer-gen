    "intro": "Mediolobivia haagei, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves and striking, pale pink or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and specific soil conditions. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Mediolobivia haagei is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
