    "intro": "Malabaila pumila, commonly known as the dwarf malabaila, is a small, shrub-like plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and broad, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in racemes, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in understory layers of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
