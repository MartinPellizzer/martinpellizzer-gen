    "intro": "Myrmecodendron cookii, commonly known as the ant-tree, is a unique tropical plant native to Central and South America. It forms a symbiotic relationship with ants, providing them with shelter in its hollow stems while receiving protection from herbivores. The plant's structure includes a central stem with branching, ant-filled chambers that serve as both habitat and defense mechanism. Its leaves are typically small and opposite, adapted to the humid, shaded environments where it grows. Myrmecodendron cookii is notable for its specialized morphology and ecological interactions, making it an interesting subject in botanical studies."
