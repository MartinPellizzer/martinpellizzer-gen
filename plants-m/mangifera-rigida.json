    "intro": "Mangifera rigida, commonly known as the rigid mango, is a species of flowering plant in the Anacardiaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its thick, rugged bark and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into edible, fibrous fruits with a sweet and tangy flavor. It is often grown for its fruit in tropical regions and is valued for its ornamental qualities as well. The rigid mango is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils."
