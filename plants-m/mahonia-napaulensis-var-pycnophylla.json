    "intro": "Mahonia napaulensis var. pycnophylla, commonly known as the dense-leaved mahonia, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern Himalayas. It features compound leaves with spiny margins and a dense, leathery texture, which contribute to its ornamental value. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by blue-black berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its hardy nature and ability to tolerate acidic conditions make it a popular choice for native plant landscapes."
