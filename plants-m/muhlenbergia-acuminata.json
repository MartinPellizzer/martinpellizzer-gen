    "intro": "Muhlenbergia acuminata, commonly known as the spikegrass, is a warm-season grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically pink to purple in color, adding ornamental value to landscapes. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Muhlenbergia acuminata is often used in native plant gardens and as a groundcover due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
