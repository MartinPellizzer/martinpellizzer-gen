    "intro": "Miconia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered miconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub or small tree in humid, shaded environments. It produces small, fleshy fruits that are often consumed by various bird species. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
