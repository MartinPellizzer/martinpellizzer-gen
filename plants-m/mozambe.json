    "intro": "Mozambe, commonly known as the Mozambique spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive yellow-orange sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy texture, while the flowers are small and clustered in complex inflorescences. Mozambe is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
