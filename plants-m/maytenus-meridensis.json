    "intro": "Maytenus meridensis, commonly known as the Mexican mayten, is a shrub or small tree native to Mexico and Central America. It belongs to the family Celtidaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing one or two seeds. Maytenus meridensis is adapted to dry, tropical climates and is often found in disturbed or secondary growth habitats. Its hardy nature makes it a resilient species in arid environments."
