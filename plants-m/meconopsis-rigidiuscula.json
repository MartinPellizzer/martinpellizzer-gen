    "intro": "Meconopsis rigidiuscula, commonly known as the rigid mountain gentian, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has a short, hairy stem and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
