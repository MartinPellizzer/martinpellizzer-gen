    "intro": "Miconia cottoniana, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of soft, velvety hairs. The plant produces showy, white or pinkish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
