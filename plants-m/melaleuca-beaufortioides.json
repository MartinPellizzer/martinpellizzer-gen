    "intro": "Melaleuca beaufortioides, commonly known as the Beaufort Island melaleuca, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland areas with a dry climate. Melaleuca beaufortioides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
