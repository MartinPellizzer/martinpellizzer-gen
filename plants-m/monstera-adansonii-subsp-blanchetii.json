    "intro": "Monstera adansonii subsp. blanchetii, commonly known as the Shingleleaf Monstera, is a tropical climbing plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, fenestrated leaves that are smaller and more compact compared to the typical Monstera adansonii. The leaves are usually a deep green with a slightly waxy texture and often have a pale underside. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This subspecies is popular as a houseplant due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
