    "intro": "Micrauchenia, commonly known as the \"small mule deer,\" is a small, extinct species of deer that lived during the Pleistocene epoch. It is characterized by its relatively small size compared to other deer species, with a body length of about 1.2 to 1.5 meters. Botanically, Micrauchenia does not have any direct botanical significance, as it is an animal rather than a plant. However, its habitat included open grasslands and shrublands, which are dominated by various grasses and forbs. The plant communities of these environments played a crucial role in the diet and survival of Micrauchenia."
