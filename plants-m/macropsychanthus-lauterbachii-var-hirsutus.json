    "intro": "Macropsychanthus lauterbachii var. hirsutus, commonly known as the hairy ghost flower, is a strikingly unique plant native to the arid regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, lantern-like inflorescences that resemble ghostly faces, hence its common name. The plant features a thick, woody stem covered in dense, hairy foliage, which helps it retain moisture in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically pale yellow to white, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. This variety is highly valued in horticulture for its unusual appearance and resilience to drought."
