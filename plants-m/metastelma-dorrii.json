    "intro": "Metastelma dorrii, commonly known as the Dorrii's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble a ghostly apparition, hence its common name. The plant has a slender, wiry stem with a single, elongated leaf that is often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. Its flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, adding a unique aesthetic to the understory of its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Metastelma dorrii is considered a critically endangered species."
