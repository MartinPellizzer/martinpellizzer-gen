    "intro": "Magnolia stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf magnolia, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces showy, white to pale pink flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. These flowers are clustered in loose panicles and emit a fragrant scent. Magnolia stricta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens for its spring blossoms and autumn foliage."
