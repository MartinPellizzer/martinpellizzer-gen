    "intro": "Malaxis roblesgiliana, commonly known as the Roblesgiliana orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on the forest floor or along rocky outcrops. Its flowers are usually short-lived, blooming for only a few weeks during the wet season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
