    "intro": "Microchilus puyoensis, commonly known as the Puyo dwarf orchid, is a small epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It typically grows on tree branches or trunks, relying on its roots for moisture and nutrients rather than soil. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with intricate patterns, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in high humidity and partial shade, making it a characteristic species of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
