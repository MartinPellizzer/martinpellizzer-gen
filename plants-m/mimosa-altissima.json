    "intro": "Mimosa altissima, commonly known as the giant sensitive plant, is a species native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Mimosa altissima is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
