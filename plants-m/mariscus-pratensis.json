    "intro": "Mariscus pratensis, commonly known as the meadow mariscus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wet meadows and grasslands in Europe. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue or purple flowers from June to August, which are borne on short pedicels. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in areas with regular water availability. Mariscus pratensis is an important component of wetland ecosystems, supporting a variety of pollinators and invertebrates."
