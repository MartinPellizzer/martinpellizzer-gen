    "intro": "Medicago aegagropila, commonly known as the goat's rue, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. It is a hardy perennial that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
