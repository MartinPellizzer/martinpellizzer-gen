It features a globular stem with a red or pinkish hue, often adorned with white or pale blue flowers during the summer months. The plant has a dense covering of white to pale blue bristles, which help protect it from intense sunlight. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a potted plant."
