    "intro": "Malleastrum depauperatum, commonly known as the poor man's mallow, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features small, hairy leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces delicate pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a soft color to its habitat. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers. Malleastrum depauperatum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in harsh environments."
