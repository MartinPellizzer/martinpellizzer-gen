    "intro": "Myriophyllum integrifolium, commonly known as watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to North America. It has finely divided, feathery leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant is often found in freshwater lakes, ponds, and slow-moving rivers. Its small, green flowers are typically borne in dense, spike-like clusters. Watermilfoil plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for fish and invertebrates."
