    "intro": "Microcoelia cornuta, commonly known as the horned microcoelia, is a small, annual herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 centimeters and features simple, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pale yellow to greenish in color, which bloom during the cooler months. Microcoelia cornuta is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient soils and can withstand periods of drought. Its unique horn-like structures on the stem are thought to aid in water retention and protection from herbivores."
