    "intro": "Meconopsis pseudovenusta, commonly known as the Himalayan blue poppy, is a striking alpine plant native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its vibrant blue or purple petals and is often found in moist, rocky habitats at high elevations. The plant belongs to the Papaveraceae family and is known for its delicate, showy flowers that bloom in early summer. Meconopsis pseudovenusta has a short lifespan, with its flowers opening only briefly before wilting. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
