    "intro": "Monodora laurentii, commonly known as African nutmeg, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and West Africa. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by clustered, egg-shaped fruits that contain aromatic seeds. The seeds are highly valued for their nutmeg-like aroma and are used in traditional medicine and as a spice. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in humid lowland forests."
