    "intro": "Maerua ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf maerua, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits that contain seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that access groundwater. Maerua ovalifolia is often used in traditional medicine and for soil stabilization in degraded landscapes."
