    "intro": "Millettia prainii, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The tree can grow up to 20 meters tall, with a straight trunk and smooth, reddish-brown bark. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and rich color, making it a sought-after material in traditional crafts and furniture. However, due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species."
