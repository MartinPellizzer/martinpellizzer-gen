    "intro": "Mezia peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian meadow grass, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Mezia peruviana is adapted to cold, arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
