It features heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves that are typically hairy and have a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pale blue or purple, followed by small, spherical fruits. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
