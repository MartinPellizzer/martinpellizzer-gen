    "intro": "Menodora linoides, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant has a distinctive scent reminiscent of vanilla, which becomes more pronounced in the evening. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds. Menodora linoides is often found in moist, shaded areas and is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological benefits."
