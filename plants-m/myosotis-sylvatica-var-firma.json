    "intro": "Myosotis sylvatica var. firma, commonly known as the firm bluebell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers. The leaves are lanceolate and typically have a hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is noted for its more compact growth habit compared to the common bluebell, making it suitable for smaller garden spaces. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, often found in woodland environments."
