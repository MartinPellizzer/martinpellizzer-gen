    "intro": "Myristica yunnanensis, commonly known as Yunnan nutmeg, is a rare evergreen tree native to the Yunnan province in China. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, aromatic seeds that resemble nutmeg. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and dark green, leathery leaves. Its fruits are covered in a thick, yellow aril that turns red when ripe. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native region."
