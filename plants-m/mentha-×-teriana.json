    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 teriana, commonly known as catnip, is a hybrid perennial plant in the mint family (Lamiaceae). It is characterized by its square, erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom in late summer. Mentha \u00d7 teriana is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been naturalized in many regions around the world. It is known for its aromatic leaves, which contain high concentrations of nepetalactone, a compound responsible for its distinctive scent and effects on animals."
