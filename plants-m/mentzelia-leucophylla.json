    "intro": "Mentzelia leucophylla, commonly known as whiteleaf blazingstar, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight. The showy yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
