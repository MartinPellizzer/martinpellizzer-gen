    "intro": "Mitreola sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessileleaf mitreola, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes many species with unique floral structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk, and are usually ovate to elliptical in shape. The flowers are inconspicuous, with unisexual male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, a characteristic known as dioecy."
