    "intro": "Mimosa meticulosa var. petiolaris, commonly known as the silky mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its soft, feathery foliage and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has delicate, palmate leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a unique texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The species is also noted for its sensitivity to touch, as the leaves fold shut when disturbed, a trait shared with other mimosa species."
