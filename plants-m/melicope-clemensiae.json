    "intro": "Melicope clemensiae, commonly known as the Hawaiian melicope, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rutaceae. It is native to the Hawaiian Islands and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, often found in moist, shaded forest habitats. Its bark is rough and fissured, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
