    "intro": "Mentha longifolia f. planitiensis, commonly known as the plains mint, is a subspecies of the mint family (Lamiaceae) characterized by its aromatic, slightly serrated leaves. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained soils, often found in dry, sunny habitats. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorled clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often used in culinary and medicinal applications due to their menthol-like fragrance and cooling properties. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in traditional herbal remedies."
