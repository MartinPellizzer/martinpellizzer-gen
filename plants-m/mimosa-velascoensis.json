    "intro": "Mimosa velascoensis, commonly known as the velvet mimosa, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its soft, feathery foliage and its ability to thrive in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are sensitive to touch, curling when disturbed, a trait known as thigmonastic response. Mimosa velascoensis is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
