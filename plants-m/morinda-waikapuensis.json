    "intro": "Morinda waikapuensis, commonly known as the Kauai morinda, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian island of Kauai. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and showy, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest habitats, often in the understory of native forests. Its fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that contains several seeds, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for native birds and insects. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation efforts."
