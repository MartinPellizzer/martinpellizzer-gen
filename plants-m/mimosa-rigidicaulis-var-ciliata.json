    "intro": "Mimosa rigidicaulis var. ciliata, commonly known as the hairy mimosa, is a variant of the rigid mimosa, native to South America. It is a shrub characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and pink to purple flowers that close at night or in response to touch. The plant has a woody stem and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
