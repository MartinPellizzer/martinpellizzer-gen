    "intro": "Mikania saxicola, commonly known as rock Mikania, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in rocky or disturbed soils, often as a climbing or trailing vine. Its small, yellowish flowers are followed by fluffy, seed-bearing structures that aid in wind dispersal. Mikania saxicola is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest undergrowth."
