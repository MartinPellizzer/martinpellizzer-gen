    "intro": "Melothria pustulata, commonly known as the prickly gooseberry, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its small, yellow-orange fruits that are typically covered in short, stiff hairs. The leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a serrated margin. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. It is valued in some regions for its edible fruits, though they are often used in local cuisines and traditional medicine."
