    "intro": "Mammillaria vivipara var. arizonica, commonly known as the Arizona hedgehog cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to the Sonoran Desert. It features a dense covering of white, woolly spines that provide protection and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stem. This variety is often cultivated for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
