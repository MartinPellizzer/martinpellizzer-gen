    "intro": "Macrosyphonia, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to South America. It features large, broad leaves that can reach up to two meters in diameter, floating on the surface of still or slow-moving freshwater bodies. The plant has showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink, often at night. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense mats. Macrosyphonia plays an important ecological role by providing habitat for aquatic life and contributing to water filtration."
