    "intro": "Munnickia, commonly known as the African rock cress, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. It is native to southern Africa and typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plants are small, herbaceous, and often have basal leaves with a rosette growth form. Munnickia species produce small, white or yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and they are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. These plants are of interest in botanical studies due to their unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
