    "intro": "Melica cristata, commonly known as the crowned wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive crown-like inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like flower clusters. Melica cristata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
