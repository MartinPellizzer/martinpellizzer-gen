    "intro": "Melodinus hatuyensis, commonly known as the Hatuy\u00e1 melodist, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its ornate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within cloud forests, where it thrives in the cool, moist climate. Its leaves are elliptical and glossy, while its flowers are clustered in inflorescences that emit a sweet, musky fragrance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
