    "intro": "Mentha aquatica f. paniculata, commonly known as water mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist environments in Europe and Asia. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, pale blue or white flowers in clustered inflorescences. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, menthol-like scent, which comes from volatile oils in its leaves and stems. It thrives in wet soils near streams, ponds, and marshes, and is often used in traditional herbal medicine. Its growth habit is typically sprawling or semi-woody, making it a common sight in aquatic and riparian habitats."
