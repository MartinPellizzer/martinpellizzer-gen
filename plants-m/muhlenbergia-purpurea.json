    "intro": "Muhlenbergia purpurea, commonly known as purple muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that often form clumps, and its leaves are typically narrow with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces feathery, pinkish-purple flower plumes in late summer, which add ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Muhlenbergia purpurea is well-suited for native plant gardens and erosion control due to its hardy nature."
