It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, yellowish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant has a rapid growth rate and can become invasive in certain environments. Its stems are often hairy and can climb using tendrils that emerge from the leaf axils. Mikania grandifolia is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks."
