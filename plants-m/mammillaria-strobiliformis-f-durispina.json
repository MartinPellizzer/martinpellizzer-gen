    "intro": "Mammillaria strobiliformis f. durispina, commonly known as the spiny mammillaria, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to Mexico. It features a dense cluster of cylindrical stems covered with white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss. The stems are adorned with prominent, spiny tubercles, giving it a distinctive, rugged appearance. It produces yellow flowers during the spring or early summer, which are typically borne on short, erect pedicels. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and arid environments due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
