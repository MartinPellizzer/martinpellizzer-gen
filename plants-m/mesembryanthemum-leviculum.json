    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum leviculum, commonly known as the coastal sandmat, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing, succulent perennial that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and white, typically blooming in the morning. Its fleshy leaves are covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Mesembryanthemum leviculum is often found in coastal dunes and rocky areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion."
