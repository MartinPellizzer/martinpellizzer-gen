    "intro": "Marsdenia urceolata, commonly known as the urn-shaped Marsdenia, is a climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by follicle fruits that contain seeds. Its unique, urn-shaped calyx is a distinguishing feature, and it is often found in moist, shaded environments. Marsdenia urceolata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
