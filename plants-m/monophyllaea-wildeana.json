It is characterized by its unique, showy flowers that typically bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern. The flowers are usually violet or purple, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species."
