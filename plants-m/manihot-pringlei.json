    "intro": "Manihot pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's manioc, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and alternate, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in umbels, and it is often cultivated for its starchy root tubers. Its growth habit and morphological features make it distinct from other manioc species, contributing to its ecological and agricultural significance in its native habitat."
