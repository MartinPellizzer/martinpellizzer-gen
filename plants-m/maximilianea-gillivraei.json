It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky soils and dry habitats. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces striking white or pale pink flowers with a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor. It has a shallow root system adapted to survive in low-water environments. Maximilianea gillivraei is valued for its resilience and is often used in xeriscaping due to its ability to thrive with minimal irrigation."
