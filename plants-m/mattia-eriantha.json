    "intro": "Mattia eriantha, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of South America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in spikes. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Mattia eriantha is often found in moist, shady environments and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
