    "intro": "Melica nodosa, commonly known as the nodding brome, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, while the flowers are wind-pollinated. Melica nodosa is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for invertebrates."
