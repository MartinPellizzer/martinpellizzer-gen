    "intro": "Myrcianthes cisplatensis var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf myrcianthes, is a species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by small, round berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
