    "intro": "Mentha arvensis f. vicearvensis, commonly known as field mint, is a subspecies of the broadleaf mint. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils in temperate regions. The plant features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a serrated margin and a strong, aromatic scent. Its flowers are small, tubular, and clustered in whorls, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. This subspecies is often used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent due to its menthol content."
