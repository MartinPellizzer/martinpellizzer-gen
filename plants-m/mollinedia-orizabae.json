    "intro": "Mollinedia orizabae, commonly known as the Orizaba mollinedia, is a rare flowering plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are ovate and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
