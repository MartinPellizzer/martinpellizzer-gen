    "intro": "Microcybe multiflora subsp. baccharoides, commonly known as the coastal dune panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils along coastal dunes and maritime habitats. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. It has fibrous roots that help stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion. Its adaptability to salt spray and wind makes it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems."
