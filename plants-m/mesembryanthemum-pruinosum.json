    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum pruinosum, commonly known as the velvet flower or frost plant, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, often hairy leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its unique ability to curl its leaves in response to touch or temperature changes is a notable adaptation. Mesembryanthemum pruinosum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes."
