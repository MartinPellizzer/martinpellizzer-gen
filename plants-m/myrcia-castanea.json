    "intro": "Myrcia castanea, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Myrcia castanea has aromatic leaves and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
