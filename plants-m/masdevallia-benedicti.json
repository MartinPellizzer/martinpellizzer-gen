    "intro": "Masdevallia benedicti, commonly known as the Benedict's masdevallia, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It features intricate, strap-like leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant is characterized by its unique, spiral arrangement of petals and sepals, which contribute to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in cool, humid environments with high light exposure but requires careful attention to moisture levels. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
