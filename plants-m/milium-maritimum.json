    "intro": "Milium maritimum, commonly known as sea millet, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. It is a small annual herb with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tiny, clustered flowers that are often white or pale green. The plant thrives in saline or brackish soils and is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions. It is valued for its edible seeds, which are rich in nutrients and have been used in traditional cuisines. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a drought-resistant crop."
