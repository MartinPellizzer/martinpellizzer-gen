    "intro": "Medicago corniculata, commonly known as the horned vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a perennial legume that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by elongated, bean-like pods. Its trifoliate leaves are characterized by a distinctive, horn-like shape at the base, giving it its common name. Medicago corniculata is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
