    "intro": "Miconia caelestis, commonly known as the sky blue miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, large, blue-violet bracts that surround its small, white flowers. The plant produces berries that range in color from yellow to red, which are edible but have a mild, sour taste. Miconia caelestis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it an invasive species in some regions."
