    "intro": "Maireana pyramidata, commonly known as the ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Maireana pyramidata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in native landscapes."
