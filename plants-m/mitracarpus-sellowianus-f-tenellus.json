    "intro": "Mitracarpus sellowianus f. tenellus, commonly known as the dwarf mitracarpus, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to South Africa. It features finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its unique foliage and modest flowering make it a valuable addition to drought-tolerant gardens."
