    "intro": "Microgramma dictyophylla, commonly known as the lace fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and thick, supporting the growth of its compound leaves. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns."
