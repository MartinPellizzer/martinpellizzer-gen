    "intro": "Microchilus fosbergii, commonly known as the Fosberg's lichen, is a species of crustose lichen belonging to the family Roccellaceae. It is characterized by its pale yellow to orange thallus, which is typically found on bark and stone in moist, shaded environments. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungal partner and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which provides it with nutrients through photosynthesis. It is primarily distributed in tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a relatively rare and specialized species within its ecological niche."
