    "intro": "Malosma laurina, commonly known as silverleaf manzanita, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense, overlapping scales on the leaves. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild, wet winters. Malosma laurina is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a habitat for native wildlife."
