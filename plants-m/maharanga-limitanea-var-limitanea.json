    "intro": "Maharanga limitanea var. limitanea, commonly known as the mountain maharanga, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of New Zealand. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces dark blue to black berries that are an important food source for native birds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
