    "intro": "Morus hispanica, commonly known as the Spanish mulberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, aggregate fruits. The plant produces white flowers in early spring, which are followed by the edible, fuzzy berries. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry woodlands. The Spanish mulberry is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
