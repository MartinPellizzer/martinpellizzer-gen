    "intro": "Minuartia stricta subsp. gracilipes, commonly known as the slender rock-cress, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. The plant features small, bright green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with four petals, and bloom in late summer. This subspecies is part of the Brassicaceae family and is often found in mountainous and tundra environments."
