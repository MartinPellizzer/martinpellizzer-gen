    "intro": "Maxillaria ctenostachys, commonly known as the feathered maxillaria, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant features long, slender sepals and petals that give it a feathery appearance, hence its common name. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Maxillaria ctenostachys is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a greenhouse or indoor setting."
