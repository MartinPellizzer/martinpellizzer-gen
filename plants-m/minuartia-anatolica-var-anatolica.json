    "intro": "Minuartia anatolica var. anatolica, commonly known as the Anatolian rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the rocky and arid regions of Anatolia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically has a mat-forming growth habit with dense, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. Its flowers, which are usually white or pale yellow, bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. This species is adapted to poor soils and is often found on limestone or sandstone substrates."
