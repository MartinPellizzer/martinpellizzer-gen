    "intro": "Micranthus obliquus, commonly known as the zigzag grass, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly encountered in its natural habitat."
