    "intro": "Madronella oblonga, commonly known as the narrowleaf madrona, is a shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and smooth, gray bark that peels in thin layers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red or orange berries that are an important food source for birds and wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. Its botanical features make it well adapted to the dry, sunny conditions of its native range."
