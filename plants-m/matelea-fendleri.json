    "intro": "Matelea fendleri, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Its milky sap, which is typical of the milkweed genus, can be toxic if ingested. Matelea fendleri plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
