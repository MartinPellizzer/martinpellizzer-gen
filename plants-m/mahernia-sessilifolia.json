    "intro": "Mahernia sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf mahernia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its leaves are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk, giving it a distinctive appearance. Mahernia sessilifolia is often found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun."
