    "intro": "Muhlenbergia xerophila, commonly known as the desert muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, white to pale blue florets. Its fibrous root system helps it survive in poor, well-drained soils, making it drought-tolerant. Muhlenbergia xerophila is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
