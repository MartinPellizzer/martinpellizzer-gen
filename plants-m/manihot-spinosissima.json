    "intro": "Manihot spinosissima, commonly known as the spiny arrowroot, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and spiny leaves, which provide a natural defense against herbivores. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The plant is also valued for its starchy roots, which can be processed into a flour-like substance."
