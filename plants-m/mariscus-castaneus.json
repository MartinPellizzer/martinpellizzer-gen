It is native to parts of Europe and Asia, and it is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The tree produces edible chestnuts encased in spiny husks, which are a valuable food source for both wildlife and humans. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has historical significance in traditional medicine and as a source of timber."
