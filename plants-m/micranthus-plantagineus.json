    "intro": "Micranthus plantagineus, commonly known as the woolly mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine, soft hairs that give it a distinctive, woolly appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its compact size and ornamental appeal make it a valuable addition to drought-tolerant landscapes."
