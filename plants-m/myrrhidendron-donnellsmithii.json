    "intro": "Myrrhidendron donnellsmithii, commonly known as the Donnellsmith's myrrhwood, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its thick, gnarled bark and aromatic, resinous leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. Its unique botanical features include the secretion of a fragrant resin, which has been used traditionally by indigenous communities. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
