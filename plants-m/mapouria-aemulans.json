    "intro": "Mapouria aemulans, commonly known as the false arum, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces dramatic, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by showy, often purple or red bracts, which attract pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
