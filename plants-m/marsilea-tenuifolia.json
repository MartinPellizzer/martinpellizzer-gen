    "intro": "Marsilea tenuifolia, commonly known as water clover, is a small aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its four-leaf clover-like structure, with each leaflet being narrow and delicate. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and wetlands. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients from the water. Marsilea tenuifolia plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
