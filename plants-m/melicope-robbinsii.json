    "intro": "Melicope robbinsii, commonly known as the Hawaiian melicope, is a member of the Rutaceae family and is native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub that typically grows in coastal and lowland habitats. The plant has opposite, simple, and often aromatic leaves with a rough texture. Its small, greenish-white flowers are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
