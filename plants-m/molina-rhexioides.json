    "intro": "Molina rhexioides, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
