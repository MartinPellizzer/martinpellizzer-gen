    "intro": "Myristica peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian nutmeg, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, oily seeds that resemble nutmeg in appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and oblong, leathery fruits that contain the aromatic seeds. The seeds are rich in essential oils and are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
