It is characterized by its smooth, grey-brown bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves with serrated margins. The tree produces small, yellow-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, subacid fruits that are typically pink to red in color. The fruit is valued for its sweet-tart flavor and is often used in culinary and medicinal applications. It is a member of the Rosaceae family and is closely related to other apple and pear species."
