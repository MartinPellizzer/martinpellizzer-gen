    "intro": "Maytenus lucayana, commonly known as the Lucayan mayten, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Caribbean, particularly the Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands. It belongs to the family Celastraceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, spherical berries that are typically red when mature. It is often found growing in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and sandy soils. Maytenus lucayana is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been used historically for various purposes."
