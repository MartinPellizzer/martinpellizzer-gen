    "intro": "Minuartia groenlandica, commonly known as the Greenland sandflower, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. It is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils, often in alpine or Arctic environments. Its ability to survive in harsh, cold climates makes it an important component of tundra ecosystems."
