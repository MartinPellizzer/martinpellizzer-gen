    "intro": "Machaerina johnsonii, commonly known as the Johnson's machaerina, is a rare and endemic shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring, attracting native pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique botanical species from threats such as habitat loss and invasive species."
