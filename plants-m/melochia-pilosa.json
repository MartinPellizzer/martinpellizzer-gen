It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its hairy stems and leaves. The leaves are typically palmately lobed and have a rough, textured surface. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
