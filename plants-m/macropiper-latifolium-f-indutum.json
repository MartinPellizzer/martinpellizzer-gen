    "intro": "Macropiper latifolium f. indutum, commonly known as the broad-leaved pepper vine, is a variant of the species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a climbing shrub characterized by its large, ovate leaves that are often densely pubescent, giving the plant a fuzzy appearance. The leaves are typically green with a slightly waxy texture, and the plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by fleshy, red berries. This variant is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for horticultural study and conservation efforts."
