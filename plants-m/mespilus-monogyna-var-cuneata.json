    "intro": "Mespilus monogyna var. cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf medlar, is a variant of the medlar tree characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia, typically growing in temperate climates. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen in the fall, often developing a unique musky aroma. Its botanical features include a shallow root system and a tendency to produce suckers, which can lead to dense growth. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
