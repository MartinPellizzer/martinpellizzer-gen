    "intro": "Menispermum reniforme, commonly known as broadleaf Dutchman\u2019s pipe, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern North America. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5 to 10 inches in diameter, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter, hairy underside. The plant produces distinctive, pipe-like flowers that are usually greenish-yellow with a prominent hooded structure. Its berries, which appear in late summer, are red and contain toxic seeds, making them unsuitable for human consumption. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
