    "intro": "Mentha soluta, commonly known as watermint, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, serrated leaves that are aromatic and slightly fuzzy to the touch. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers in whorls along the stems, typically blooming in late summer. Watermint contains high concentrations of menthol and other essential oils, which contribute to its cooling and refreshing properties. It is often used in culinary and medicinal applications due to its aromatic and therapeutic qualities."
