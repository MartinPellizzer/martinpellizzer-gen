    "intro": "Magnolia hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy magnolia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive hairy leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 6 meters and prefers moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine, white hairs, contributing to its unique appearance. The flowers, which are usually white or pale pink, are clustered in pendulous racemes and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
