    "intro": "Meconopsis wanbaensis, commonly known as the Wanba meconopsis, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet, China. It belongs to the Papaveraceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers, which bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool and moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps protect it from harsh weather conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Meconopsis wanbaensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
