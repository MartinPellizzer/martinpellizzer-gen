    "intro": "Microchilus vallecaucanus, commonly known as the Colombian bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or rocky slopes. Its leaves are opposite, lanceolate, and covered with fine hairs, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Microchilus vallecaucanus plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small invertebrates."
