    "intro": "Melothria repanda, commonly known as the red gooseberry, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It produces small, bright red fruits that are often mistaken for berries but are technically accessory fruits. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and thrives in warm, humid climates. Its flowers are yellow and clustered, typical of the Cucurbitaceae family. The fruit is edible, though some varieties can be quite tart, and it is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
