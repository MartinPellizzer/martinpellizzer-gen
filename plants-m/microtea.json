It produces tiny, delicate leaves that are the primary source of its unique flavor and aroma. The plant thrives in cool, humid climates and requires well-drained, acidic soil for optimal growth. Its flowers are pale pink and bloom in early spring, adding ornamental value to the plant. Microtea is prized for its use in traditional herbal teas and its role in ecological landscapes."
