    "intro": "Mastichodendron foetidissimum subsp. typicum, commonly known as the stinking mastichodendron, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and distinctive, strongly aromatic resinous secretions. The plant belongs to the family Myristicaceae and is notable for its unique chemical composition, which includes various volatile compounds. Its habitat is highly specialized, often found in shaded, humid environments with rich organic soil. Due to its rarity and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
