    "intro": "Maesa decidua, commonly known as the deciduous maesa, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer seasons. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a leathery texture, adapting to its often humid and shaded habitats. Maesa decidua is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils."
