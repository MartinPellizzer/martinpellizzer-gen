    "intro": "Mammillaria aulacothele var. multispina, commonly known as the clustered milk barrel cactus, is a low-growing, spineless cactus native to Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, white woolly hairs, which help protect it from intense sunlight and moisture loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. It is well-suited for rock gardens and arid environments due to its drought tolerance. Its compact size and unique appearance make it a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts."
