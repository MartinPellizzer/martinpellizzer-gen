    "intro": "[WRONG START] Macleidium speciosum, commonly known as the showy macleidium, is a flowering plant native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered within the bract structure. It thrives in warm, moist environments and is often found in the understorey of tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
