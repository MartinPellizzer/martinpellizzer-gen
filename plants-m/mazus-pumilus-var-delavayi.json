    "intro": "Mazus pumilus var. delavayi, commonly known as Delavay's dwarf mazus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan and Yunnan in China. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers during the summer months, which are borne on slender stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings."
