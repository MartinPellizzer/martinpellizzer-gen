    "intro": "Melolobium decumbens, commonly known as the prostrate melolobium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, often in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Melolobium decumbens is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
