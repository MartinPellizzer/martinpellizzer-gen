    "intro": "Muhlenbergia breviligula, commonly known as the narrowleaf muhlenbergia, is a species of grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that are typically pink or purple, adding ornamental value to gardens. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Muhlenbergia breviligula is often used in native plant gardens for its low maintenance and ecological benefits."
