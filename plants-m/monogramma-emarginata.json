It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 inches long. The plant has a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread along the forest floor. Its leaves are characterized by their finely toothed margins and a pale green color. Monogramma emarginata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rich, organic soils."
