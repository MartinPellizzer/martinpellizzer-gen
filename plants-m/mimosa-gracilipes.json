It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant is typically shrub-like, with slender stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. The flowers bloom in clusters and are known for their ability to close when touched, a trait shared with other mimosa species."
