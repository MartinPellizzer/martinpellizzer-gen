    "intro": "Marsilea fabri, commonly known as the water clover, is a small aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its four-leaf clover-like structure, with each leaflet being a small, rounded blade. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients from the water. Marsilea fabri plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
