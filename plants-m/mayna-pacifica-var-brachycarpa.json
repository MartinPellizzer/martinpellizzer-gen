    "intro": "Mayna pacifica var. brachycarpa, commonly known as the Pacific mayna, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by distinctive, narrow fruits. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
