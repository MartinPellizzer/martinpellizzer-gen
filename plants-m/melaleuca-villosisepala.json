    "intro": "Melaleuca villosisepala, commonly known as the woolly-lobed paperbark, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fibrous bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters, which are typically followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in fine, silky hairs, contributing to its unique texture. Melaleuca villosisepala is often found in coastal and sandy soils, thriving in well-drained environments."
