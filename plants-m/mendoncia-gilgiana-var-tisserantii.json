    "intro": "Mendoncia gilgiana var. tisserantii, commonly known as the Tisserant's mendoncia, is a rare and striking member of the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes, where it thrives in cool, humid environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late summer. It is often found growing in rocky soils and among shrubs in montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
