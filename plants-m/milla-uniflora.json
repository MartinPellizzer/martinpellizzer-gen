It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant has a compact growth habit, typically reaching only a few inches in height. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to store water in its native environment. Milla uniflora is often found in rocky soils and is highly sensitive to changes in moisture and temperature."
