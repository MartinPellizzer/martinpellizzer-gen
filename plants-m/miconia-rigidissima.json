    "intro": "Miconia rigidissima, commonly known as the rigid miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its large, dark green, leathery leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces showy, pale yellow or white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which are typically borne at the ends of branches. Its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Miconia rigidissima is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of tropical and subtropical environments."
