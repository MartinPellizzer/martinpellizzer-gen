It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom throughout the year in warm climates. Its fruits are fleshy berries that turn red when mature, containing numerous seeds. Miconia lasiocalyx is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets."
