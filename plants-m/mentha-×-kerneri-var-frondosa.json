    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 kerneri var. frondosa, commonly known as the broad-leaf peppermint, is a hybrid mint species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, oval-shaped leaves that are often broader than those of its parent species. The plant produces small, pale purple flowers that bloom in whorls along the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its aromatic leaves contain high concentrations of menthol, making it valuable for both culinary and medicinal uses."
