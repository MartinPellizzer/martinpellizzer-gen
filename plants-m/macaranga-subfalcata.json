    "intro": "Macaranga subfalcata, commonly known as the broadleaf paper plant, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and often elliptic or ovate leaves that are usually glabrous or nearly so. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in panicles, followed by capsules that release numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in lowland forests. Its leaves are used in traditional papermaking due to their fibrous structure."
