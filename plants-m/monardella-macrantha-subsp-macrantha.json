    "intro": "Monardella macrantha subsp. macrantha, commonly known as the showy mountain mint, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features upright stems covered in fine, hairy hairs and produces showy, lavender-blue flower clusters at the top of the plant. The leaves are lance-shaped, serrated, and often have a strong mint-like aroma when crushed. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, typically found in open woodlands and meadows. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
