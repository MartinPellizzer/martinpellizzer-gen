    "intro": "Mattiastrum glastifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved mat grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southern United States. It features upright, clump-forming stems that bear narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a waxy, bluish-green appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade conditions."
