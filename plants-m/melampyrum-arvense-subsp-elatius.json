    "intro": "Melampyrum arvense subsp. elatius, commonly known as red bartsia, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically red or reddish in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, roadsides, and woodland edges. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical studies."
