    "intro": "Molinia varia, commonly known as the variable moor grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils in wetlands, bogs, and heathlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tufted at the base, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its variability in growth form and habitat preference, which contributes to its common name. Molinia varia plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
