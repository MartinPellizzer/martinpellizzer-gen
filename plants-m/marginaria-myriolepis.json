    "intro": "Marginaria myriolepis, commonly known as the many-leafed marginaria, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia and thrives in moist, temperate climates. Marginaria myriolepis is often found in woodland edges and along stream banks, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat."
