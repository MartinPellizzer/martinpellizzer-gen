    "intro": "Morisonia flexuosa, commonly known as the twisted willow, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems that often trail along the ground or climb low structures. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a distinctive wavy or undulating edge. Morisonia flexuosa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
