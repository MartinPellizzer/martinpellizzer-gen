    "intro": "Molinia distans var. capillaris, commonly known as slender moor grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils, often found in heathlands, bogs, and along the edges of wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. It is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates. Its distinctive appearance makes it a notable plant in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
