    "intro": "Maesa aneiteensis, commonly known as the African snowberry, is a shrub native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces bright red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain birds and mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or on rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
