It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has spiny, woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves adapted to conserve water. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with a distinctive central disk surrounded by ray florets.
