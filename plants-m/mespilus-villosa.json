    "intro": "Mespilus villosa, commonly known as the hairy medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive hairy leaves and small, clustered flowers that appear in early spring. The fruit, which resembles a small apple, is typically harvested in late autumn and has a unique, somewhat fermented flavor. The plant is often found in rocky or dry soils and is adapted to mild, temperate climates. It is also valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
