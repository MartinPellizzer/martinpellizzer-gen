    "intro": "Mespilus \u00d7 canescens, commonly known as the white medlar, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between the medlar (Mespilus germanica) and the common hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna). It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. The plant features oval, dark green leaves and produces small, white flowers in early spring. Its fruit is a pome, typically turning from green to yellow or red as it ripens, and is often used in jams and preserves. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
