    "intro": "Mimosa macrocalyx, commonly known as the giant sensitive plant, is a species native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Due to its delicate appearance and unique movement, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
