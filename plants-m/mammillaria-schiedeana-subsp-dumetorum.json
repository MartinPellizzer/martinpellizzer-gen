    "intro": "Mammillaria schiedeana subsp. dumetorum, commonly known as the Desert Hedgehog Cactus, is a low-growing cactus native to Mexico. It features a compact, rounded stem covered in small, white tubercles that give it a spiny, textured appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short, erect pedicels. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its slow growth rate and unique morphology make it a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
