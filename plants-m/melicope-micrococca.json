    "intro": "Melicope micrococca, commonly known as the Hawaiian hibiscus or *Hibiscus tiliaceus*, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, including Hawaii, Tahiti, and other parts of Polynesia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 5 meters in height, featuring lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, blooming in clusters. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Melicope micrococca is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to grow in sandy or limestone soils."
