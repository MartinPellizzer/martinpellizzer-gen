    "intro": "Mentha aquatica var. lloydii, commonly known as the Lloyd's water mint, is a perennial herb native to wetlands and stream banks in North America. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in whorled clusters along the upper stems. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in shaded to partially sunny environments. This variety is closely related to other members of the mint family and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
