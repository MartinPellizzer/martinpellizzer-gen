The plant is characterized by its large, lobed leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
