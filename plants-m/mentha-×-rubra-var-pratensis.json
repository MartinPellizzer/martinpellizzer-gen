    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 rubra var. pratensis, commonly known as field mint, is a hybrid species within the mint family, Lamiaceae. It is characterized by its aromatic, slightly minty scent and its ability to thrive in moist, temperate environments. The plant typically features square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a serrated margin. Its small, tubular flowers are usually pink or purple and appear in whorls along the stems. Field mint is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinator populations."
