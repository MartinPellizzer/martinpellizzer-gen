    "intro": "Mohlana secunda var. acuminata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mohlana, is a South African plant belonging to the Acanthaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, arranged in whorled clusters along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable addition to botanical collections."
