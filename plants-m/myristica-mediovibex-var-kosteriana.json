    "intro": "Myristica mediovibex var. kosteriana, commonly known as Koster's myristica, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Myristicaceae family. It is native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions such as Sumatra and Borneo. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. Its fruit is a drupe, containing a single seed enclosed in a hard, aromatic shell. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
