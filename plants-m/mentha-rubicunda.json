    "intro": "Mentha rubicunda, commonly known as the red mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and bright red stems, which distinguish it from other mint species. The leaves are typically oval to lance-shaped, with a serrated edge and a slightly hairy surface. It produces small, pale purple to white flowers in whorls along the stem, which bloom in late summer. This species is valued for its aromatic leaves and is often used in herbal teas and traditional medicine."
