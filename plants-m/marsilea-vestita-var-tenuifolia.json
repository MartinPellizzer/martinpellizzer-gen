    "intro": "Marsilea vestita var. tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water clover, is a aquatic fern native to parts of Asia. It features small, floating leaves that are divided into four oval segments, giving it a clover-like appearance. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Its reproductive structures include sporocarps that contain spores for propagation. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
