    "intro": "Muhlenbergia microsperma, commonly known as the narrowleaf muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-like flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Muhlenbergia microsperma is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soils in arid environments."
