    "intro": "Marcetia acerosa, commonly known as the hard-leaved marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. The plant features erect, slender stems with lance-shaped leaves that are tough and leathery in texture. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in a spike, often blooming in late summer. Marcetia acerosa is noted for its ecological importance as a food source for certain insect species."
