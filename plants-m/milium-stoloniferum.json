    "intro": "Milium stoloniferum, commonly known as the tufted grass or mouse-tail grass, is a perennial flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its clump-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white or pale green flowers. Its stolons allow it to spread horizontally, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Milium stoloniferum is often found in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas."
