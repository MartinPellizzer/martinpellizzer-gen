    "intro": "Maytenus ardisiifolia, commonly known as the red-leaf mayten, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage that turns reddish in the fall, giving it a striking visual appeal. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and have a leathery texture. Maytenus ardisiifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
