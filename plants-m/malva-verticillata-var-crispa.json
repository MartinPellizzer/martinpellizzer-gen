    "intro": "Malva verticillata var. crispa, commonly known as the crinkled mallows, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are palmately lobed with a distinctive crinkled or wavy margin. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in herbal medicine. The species is also known for its ability to spread via rhizomes, making it both a decorative and potentially invasive plant in certain environments."
