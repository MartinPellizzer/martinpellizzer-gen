    "intro": "Metathelypteris, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Blechnaceae. These plants are characterized by their large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. They are typically found in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where they provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. The fronds are usually divided into numerous pinnae, which are often feather-like in appearance. Metathelypteris species are also notable for their ability to tolerate a range of water conditions, making them adaptable to different aquatic ecosystems."
