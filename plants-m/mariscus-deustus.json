    "intro": "Mariscus deustus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Mariscus deustus is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
