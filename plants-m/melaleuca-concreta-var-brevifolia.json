    "intro": "Melaleuca concreta var. brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, typically with a glossy green upper surface and a pale underside. It produces small, bottle-shaped flowers that are usually red or pink, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or heathland environments."
