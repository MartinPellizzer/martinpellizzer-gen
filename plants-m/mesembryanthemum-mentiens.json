It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, which is known for its succulent species adapted to arid environments. The plant features fleshy, silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss, and it produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and white. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is widely cultivated in regions with Mediterranean climates."
