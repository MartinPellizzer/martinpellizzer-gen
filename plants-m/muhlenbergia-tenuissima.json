    "intro": "Muhlenbergia tenuissima, commonly known as hairgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and delicate, grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its flowering stalks produce small, fluffy panicles that release lightweight seeds, aiding in its spread. Muhlenbergia tenuissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland habitats."
