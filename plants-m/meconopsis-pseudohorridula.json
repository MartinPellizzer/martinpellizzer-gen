    "intro": "Meconopsis pseudohorridula, commonly known as the Himalayan blue poppy, is a striking alpine plant native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its vivid blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in mountainous regions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps protect it from harsh weather conditions. Meconopsis pseudohorridula is a member of the Papaveraceae family and is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological significance in its native habitat."
