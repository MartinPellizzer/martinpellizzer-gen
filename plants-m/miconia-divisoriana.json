    "intro": "Miconia divisoriana, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters in height, characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces showy, clustered inflorescences with white or pink flowers that bloom throughout the wet season. Its fruits are fleshy berries that turn red when mature, containing numerous small seeds. Miconia divisoriana is known for its rapid growth and is considered an invasive species in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation."
