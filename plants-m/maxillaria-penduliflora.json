    "intro": "Maxillaria penduliflora, commonly known as the pendant-flowered orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences bearing numerous small, fragrant flowers with white to pale pink petals and a distinctive, often hairy lip. Its blooming period typically occurs during the warmer months, and it thrives in bright, indirect light with high humidity. Due to its ornamental value, it is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its elegant, cascading floral display."
