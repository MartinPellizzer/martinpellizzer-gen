    "intro": "Medinilla compacta, commonly known as the velvet tangerine or Chinese hibiscus, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features dense, dark green foliage with a velvety texture, and its most distinctive characteristic is its showy, waxy flowers that range in color from pink to red. The flowers are typically borne in clusters and have a subtle fragrance, making the plant a popular ornamental choice. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Medinilla compacta is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
