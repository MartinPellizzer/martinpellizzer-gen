    "intro": "Microlepia kwangtungensis, commonly known as the Guangdong microlepia, is a fern native to southeastern China. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are relatively short, and the leaves are often clustered at the base. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
