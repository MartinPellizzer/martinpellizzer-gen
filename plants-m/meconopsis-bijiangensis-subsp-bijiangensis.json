    "intro": "Meconopsis bijiangensis subsp. bijiangensis, commonly known as the Bijiang meconopsis, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in high-altitude meadows and rocky habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
