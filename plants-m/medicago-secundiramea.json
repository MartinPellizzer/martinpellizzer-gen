    "intro": "Medicago secundiramea, commonly known as the lesser medick, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. It has a creeping growth habit and produces small, round pods that contain several seeds. Medicago secundiramea is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
