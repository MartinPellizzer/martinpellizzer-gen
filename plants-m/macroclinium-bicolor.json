    "intro": "Macroclinium bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored orchid, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bicolor flowers that typically feature a white or pale pink base with a deep red or purple hue at the throat. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in greenhouses and tropical gardens."
