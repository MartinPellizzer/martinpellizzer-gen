    "intro": "Microstylis kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu microstylis, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, commonly known as the orchid family, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky substrates or in montane forests. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, adapted to the cool, humid climate of its habitat. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
