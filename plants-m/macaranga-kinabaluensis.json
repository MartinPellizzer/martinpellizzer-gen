    "intro": "Macaranga kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu macaranga, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Borneo. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish flowers that are typically surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is often found growing in moist, shaded environments within montane forests. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
