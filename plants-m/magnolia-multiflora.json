It is characterized by its large, showy white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The tree has simple, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Magnolia multiflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
