    "intro": "Memecylon subramanii, commonly known as the Indian memecylon, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by spherical, red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense undergrowth of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
