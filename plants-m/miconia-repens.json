    "intro": "Miconia repens, commonly known as the prostrate miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia repens thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. It is also noted for its ability to spread rapidly, making it a potential invasive species in certain regions."
