    "intro": "Medicago loretii, commonly known as the Loretto clover, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a low-growing annual herb with trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. This characteristic makes it valuable for soil enrichment in ecological restoration projects."
