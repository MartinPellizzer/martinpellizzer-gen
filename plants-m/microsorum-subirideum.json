    "intro": "Microsorum subirideum, commonly known as the red-veined water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that display a striking contrast of light green and deep red veins. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in shaded, muddy habitats. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the substrate, contributing to water filtration and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is also cultivated in aquariums and water gardens."
