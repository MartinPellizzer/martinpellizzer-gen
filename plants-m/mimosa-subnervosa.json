    "intro": "Mimosa subnervosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf mimosa, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by fluffy, grayish seed pods. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Mimosa subnervosa is also known for its sensitive leaves that fold when touched, a trait shared with other members of the Mimosa genus."
