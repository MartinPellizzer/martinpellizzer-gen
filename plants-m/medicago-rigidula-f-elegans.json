    "intro": "Medicago rigidula f. elegans, commonly known as the elegant sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems with trifoliate leaves composed of small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration and as a forage plant."
