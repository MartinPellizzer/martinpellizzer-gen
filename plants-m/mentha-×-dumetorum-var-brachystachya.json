    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 dumetorum var. brachystachya, commonly known as \"pennyroyal,\" is a hybrid mint species characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and compact growth habit. It is native to temperate regions of the northern hemisphere and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal remedies, though the plant contains toxic compounds that require caution in use. This variety is distinguished by its shorter floral stems compared to other Mentha species."
