    "intro": "Mimosa strobiliflora, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in spherical clusters called corymbs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Mimosa strobiliflora is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its unique foliage and delicate blooms."
