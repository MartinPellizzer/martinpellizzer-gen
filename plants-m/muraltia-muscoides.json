    "intro": "Muraltia muscoides, commonly known as the musk acacia, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, round, reddish-brown pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and for soil stabilization."
