    "intro": "Mycopteris martiniana, commonly known as the Martin's shield fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The fronds are typically leathery and have a distinctive, shield-shaped appearance, which gives the plant its common name. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant's spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spore dispersal."
