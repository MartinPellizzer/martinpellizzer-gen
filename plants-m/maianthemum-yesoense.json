    "intro": "Maianthemum yesoense, commonly known as the Yesoese False Lily of the Wall, is a rare and endemic flowering plant native to Japan. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It is noted for its low-growing habit and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
