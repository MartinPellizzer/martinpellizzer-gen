    "intro": "Maguireothamnus tatei var. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf maguireothamnus, is a rare shrub native to specific regions of New Zealand. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring and summer months, which are arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is typically found in coastal or inland scrub habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
