    "intro": "Myriactis cuchumatanica, commonly known as the Cuchumatanica Myriactis, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Myriaptyllaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that bloom in shades of purple and white. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
