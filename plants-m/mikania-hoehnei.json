    "intro": "Mikania hoehnei, commonly known as the Hoehne's Mikania, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, daisy-like flowers. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Mikania hoehnei is often found in moist, sunny habitats like forests and grasslands. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through runners make it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive in certain regions."
