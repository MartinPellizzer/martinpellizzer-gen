    "intro": "Mentha aquatica subsp. lanigera, commonly known as the woolly water mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often along the edges of ponds, streams, and marshes. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in whorls, producing a mild minty scent. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting aquatic ecosystems."
