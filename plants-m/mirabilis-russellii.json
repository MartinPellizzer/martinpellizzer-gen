    "intro": "Mirabilis russellii, commonly known as the Russell's four-o'clock, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces striking, vibrant flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant is named for its flowers, which open in the late afternoon and close at night, a behavior known as nyctinasty. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and drought tolerance."
