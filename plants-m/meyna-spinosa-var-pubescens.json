    "intro": "Meyna spinosa var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy meyna, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, elliptical leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. It is typically found in coastal and sandy soils, thriving in well-drained environments. The hairy meyna is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
