    "intro": "Mephitidia plagiophylla, commonly known as the flat-leaf mephit, is a rare flowering plant native to the humid lowland forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that reflect excess sunlight, a trait that aids in its survival in high-light environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the late spring and early summer. Its root system is fibrous and highly adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in shaded undergrowth. Due to habitat loss, Mephitidia plagiophylla is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas."
