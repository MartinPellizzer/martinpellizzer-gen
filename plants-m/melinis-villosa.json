    "intro": "Melinis villosa, commonly known as hairy bluestem, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. This plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Melinis villosa plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, add visual interest to wetland ecosystems."
