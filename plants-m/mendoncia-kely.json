    "intro": "Mendoncia kely, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its elegant, pale greenish-white flowers with a subtle metallic sheen. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and thrives in well-drained, loamy soil. Its leaves are broad, waxy, and often have a silvery or grayish coating, which helps reduce water loss. Mendoncia kely is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
