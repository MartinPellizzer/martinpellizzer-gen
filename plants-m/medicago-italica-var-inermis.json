    "intro": "Medicago italica var. inermis, commonly known as the slender Medicago, is a low-growing annual legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features trifoliate leaves with slender stipules and produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and is used in some ecological restoration projects. The seeds are small and can be dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
