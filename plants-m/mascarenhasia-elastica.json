    "intro": "Mascarenhasia elastica, commonly known as the elastic sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant is adapted to coastal environments, thriving in salty, sandy soils and withstands high winds and salt spray. Its elastic stems allow it to bend without breaking, aiding in survival during stormy weather. Mascarenhasia elastica plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
