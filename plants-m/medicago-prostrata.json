    "intro": "Medicago prostrata, commonly known as prostrate medick, is a low-growing leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, trifoliate leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, due to its tolerance for poor soil conditions. It has a creeping growth habit, with stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Medicago prostrata is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
