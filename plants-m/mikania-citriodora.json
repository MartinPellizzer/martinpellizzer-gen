    "intro": "Mikania citriodora, commonly known as lemon vine, is a climbing plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive citrus scent. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into fluffy, white seed heads. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in disturbed habitats such as forest edges and garden areas. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
