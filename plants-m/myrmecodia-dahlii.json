    "intro": "Myrmecodia dahlii, commonly known as the ant plant, is a unique epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its swollen, honeycomb-like stems that provide shelter for ants, which in turn protect the plant from herbivores. The plant's leaves are small, leathery, and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. It produces small, white or greenish flowers that are typically borne in clusters. Myrmecodia dahlii is prized in horticulture for its distinctive appearance and symbiotic relationship with ants."
