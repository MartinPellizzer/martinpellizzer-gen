    "intro": "Mammillaria rhodantha f. andreae, commonly known as the Andrea's pink mammillaria, is a compact cactus with a globular shape and a pale pink to reddish coloration. It features prominent areoles covered with white to pale yellow hairs, and its flowers are typically pink or red, emerging from the areoles. Native to Mexico, this variety thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light. It is relatively cold-hardy and is appreciated for its ornamental value in rock gardens and as a container plant. Due to its rarity, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to ensure its survival."
