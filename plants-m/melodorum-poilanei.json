    "intro": "Melodorum poilanei, commonly known as the Madagascar violet, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the humid forests of Madagascar. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers and velvety foliage. The plant typically grows as a small shrub, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters, with opposite, ovate leaves. Its flowers bloom in clusters and are pollinated primarily by hummingbirds and small insects. Due to habitat destruction, Melodorum poilanei is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts in Madagascar."
