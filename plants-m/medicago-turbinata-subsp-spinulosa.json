    "intro": "Medicago turbinata subsp. spinulosa, commonly known as the spiked medic, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features slender, upright stems with small, trifoliate leaves that are hairy and often covered in fine spines. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers that are typically clustered in racemes, followed by small, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in steppe and Mediterranean habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock."
