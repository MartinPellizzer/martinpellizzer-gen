    "intro": "Minuartia verna subsp. gerardi, commonly known as the spring rock-cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with closely spaced, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found on limestone or sandy substrates. Its botanical structure is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds typical of its mountainous habitat."
