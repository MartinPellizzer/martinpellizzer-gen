    "intro": "Monotoca submutica var. autumnalis, commonly known as the autumnal bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. It thrives in nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its diet with captured prey. Its flowers are typically greenish-white, and it blooms in late summer to early autumn."
