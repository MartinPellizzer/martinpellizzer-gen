    "intro": "Marica glauca, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring slender, upright stems covered in fine, silvery-blue hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white, mist-like flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-gray hue due to the dense covering of fine hairs. Marica glauca is well adapted to moist, sunny habitats and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
