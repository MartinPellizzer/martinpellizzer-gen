    "intro": "Mammilloydia candida subsp. ortizrubioana, commonly known as the white mammilloydia, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
