    "intro": "Melochia anomala, commonly known as the velvetleaf or melochia, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its rough, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal spikes, followed by distinctive, three-lobed, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic properties. The plant thrives in moist, tropical climates and is often found in disturbed soils and agricultural areas."
