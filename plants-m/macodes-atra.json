    "intro": "Macodes atra, commonly known as the black-stemmed millepore, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black stems and leaves that range from dark green to almost black in color. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are often clustered together, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Macodes atra is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
