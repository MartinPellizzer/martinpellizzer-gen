    "intro": "Melica sarmentosa var. pilosula, commonly known as the hairy or silky melica, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping growth habit and dense, tufted clusters of leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. This variety is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks."
