    "intro": "Miconia nicotianifolia, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically velvety to the touch, with a deep green upper surface and a lighter green underside. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers, followed by bright red or orange fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland tropical forests. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative propagation, it can become invasive in certain regions."
