    "intro": "Marsdenia tricholepis, commonly known as the hairy Marsdenia, is a climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by elliptical, orange-red berries. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it requires partial shade and well-drained soil."
