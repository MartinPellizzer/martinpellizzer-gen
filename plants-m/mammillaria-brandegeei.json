    "intro": "Mammillaria brandegeei, commonly known as the Brandegee's pincushion cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a globular stem with white, woolly spines and a dense covering of fine, white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring or early summer, which are followed by small, red fruits. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its habitat fragmentation, it is considered threatened in some areas."
