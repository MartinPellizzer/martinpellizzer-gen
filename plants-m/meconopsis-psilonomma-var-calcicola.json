    "intro": "Meconopsis psilonomma var. calcicola, commonly known as the alpine meconopsis, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is a member of the Papaveraceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, calcareous soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous environments. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
