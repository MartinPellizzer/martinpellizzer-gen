    "intro": "Mertensia maritima subsp. tenella, commonly known as the coastal bluebells, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of the northeastern United States. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant produces striking clusters of bell-shaped, sky-blue flowers in early spring, which are followed by egg-shaped, blue-green capsules containing the seeds. Its leaves are lanceolate, with a hairy surface, and it is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing dune ecosystems."
