    "intro": "Melocactus ammotrophus, commonly known as the white-haired melocactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem covered in dense, white spines that provide insulation and protection from herbivores. The plant produces a single, large, yellowish-white flower during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its root system is shallow and adapted to absorb moisture quickly from infrequent rains. Melocactus ammotrophus is well-suited to harsh desert environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil to thrive."
