    "intro": "Mentzelia packardiae, commonly known as Packard's blazingstar, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as gravelly slopes and disturbed areas. It has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that disperse its seeds. Mentzelia packardiae is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
