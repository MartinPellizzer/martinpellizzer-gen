    "intro": "Mercurialis leiocarpa, commonly known as the white mercury or white mercurial, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its unique floral structures and latex-producing properties. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are typically alternate and ovate. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its toxic nature, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
