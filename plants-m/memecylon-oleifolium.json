    "intro": "Memecylon oleifolium, commonly known as the oil-leaf memecylon, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, giving them a distinctive oily sheen. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are typically followed by small, round fruits. Its leaves are rich in essential oils and have been used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Memecylon oleifolium thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests."
