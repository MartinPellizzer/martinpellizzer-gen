    "intro": "Magdalenaea, commonly known as the desert bean, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas, particularly in Mexico and the southwestern United States. Magdalenaea species are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their compound leaves and pods that contain edible seeds. They have adapted to harsh environments through deep root systems and drought-resistant features. The genus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing food for wildlife."
