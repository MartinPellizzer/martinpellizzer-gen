    "intro": "Muehlenbeckia truncata, commonly known as the silver cotoneaster, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, elliptical leaves that have a silvery-white underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny, red flowers in late summer, which are followed by small, orange-brown berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil. Muehlenbeckia truncata is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in coastal environments."
