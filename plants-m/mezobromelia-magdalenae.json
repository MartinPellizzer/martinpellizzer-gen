    "intro": "Mezobromelia magdalenae, commonly known as the Magdalena bromeliad, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the humid forests of Colombia, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. Its flowers, which are typically red or orange, bloom in the summer and attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
