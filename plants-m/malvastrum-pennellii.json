    "intro": "Malvastrum pennellii, commonly known as the Mexican mallow, is a flowering plant native to Central America. It is characterized by its showy, pink or red bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in disturbed areas and along roadsides. Malvastrum pennellii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant display."
