    "intro": "Microstachys glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky leaved grass, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs, giving them a sticky texture. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in moist, sunny habitats. Microstachys glandulosa is often found in wetlands, prairies, and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
