    "intro": "Metathelypteris vandervekenii, commonly known as the Vanderveken's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae. The plant is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to stream banks or moist soil. The species is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens or as a decorative foliage plant."
