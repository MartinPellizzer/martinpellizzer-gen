    "intro": "Mentha longifolia f. schneekapellae, commonly known as the Schneekapelle mint, is a variant of the longleaf mint, characterized by its distinct floral morphology and aromatic properties. This subspecies is native to Central Europe and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. It possesses narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a strong, minty fragrance, which are often used in traditional herbal remedies. The flowers are small, tubular, and typically pale blue or purple, arranged in dense spikes. Its botanical significance lies in its unique genetic traits and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
