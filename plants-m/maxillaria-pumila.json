    "intro": "Maxillaria pumila, commonly known as the miniature orchid or dwarf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its small, compact growth habit and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant features a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in high-altitude, cool climates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in well-drained soil with moderate sunlight. Maxillaria pumila is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation."
