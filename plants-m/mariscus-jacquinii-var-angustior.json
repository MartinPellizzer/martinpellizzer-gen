The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests or along stream banks. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered, highlighting the need for its protection."
