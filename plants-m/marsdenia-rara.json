It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by follicles containing seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
