    "intro": "Mitchella undulata f. minor, commonly known as the lesser trailing arbutus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often accompanied by elliptical, leathery leaves. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is typically found in shaded, moist woodlands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
