    "intro": "Macrocarpaea, commonly known as the \"Everlasting\" or \"Immortelle,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most notably Macrocarpaea ciliata, which is native to southern Africa. The plant is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in arid or semi-arid conditions. Its flowers are typically small and yellow, arranged in dense clusters, and it produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. Macrocarpaea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its resilience in challenging environments."
