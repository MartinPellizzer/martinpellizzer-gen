    "intro": "Miconia formonensis, commonly known as the Brazilian angel's trumpets, is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters in height, characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The flowers are typically pink to purple in color and bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators such as birds and insects. The plant produces small, round berries that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in warm climates, although it can become invasive in certain environments."
