    "intro": "Mimosa prostrata var. natans, commonly known as floating mimosa, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, fern-like leaves that allow it to float on the surface of water. The plant produces clusters of pink or red flowers that bloom in response to touch, a trait known as thigmonasty. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Due to its ability to spread rapidly, it can become invasive in certain aquatic ecosystems."
