    "intro": "Mapania theobromina, commonly known as the cocoa tree, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen nature and large, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that develop into pods containing the seeds used to make chocolate. Its botanical significance lies in its role as the primary source of cocoa beans, which are essential in the production of chocolate and other food products. Theobromine, a stimulant compound found in its seeds, contributes to its unique flavor and physiological effects."
