    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 aquaticoarvensis f. opaca, commonly known as the opaca water mint, is a hybrid plant belonging to the mint family Lamiaceae. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy on the upper surface. The plant produces small, pale blue to violet flowers in whorls along the upper stems, which bloom in late summer. It is typically found in wetland habitats such as marshes and stream banks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its aromatic leaves and flowers make it a valuable plant for both ecological and horticultural purposes."
