    "intro": "Mentha aquatica f. subsessilifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water mint, is a variant of the water mint species native to moist environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, sessile leaves that are often shorter and more compact compared to the typical form of Mentha aquatica. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers arranged in whorled clusters, typical of the mint family. It thrives in wet meadows, stream banks, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. Its aromatic leaves and medicinal properties have made it a subject of interest in both traditional and modern herbal practices."
