    "intro": "Marginaria piloselloides var. cayennensis, commonly known as the Cayenne ragged robin, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its small, clustered inflorescences attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
