It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. Its spores are dispersed through wind, and it requires specific humidity and soil conditions to thrive. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
