    "intro": "Microstegium imberbe, commonly known as the rough-stemmed wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It is a member of the Oxalidaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and yellow flowers. The plant has rough, hairy stems and is often found in moist, woodland habitats. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Microstegium imberbe is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native plants."
