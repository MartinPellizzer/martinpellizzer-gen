    "intro": "Minuartia procumbens f. glaucovirens, commonly known as the glaucous rockcress, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white to bluish waxy hairs, giving it a distinctive glaucous appearance. The flowers are usually pink to purple, with four petals arranged in a cross shape, typical of the Brassicaceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sun-exposed habitats. This plant is adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
