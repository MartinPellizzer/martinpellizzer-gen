    "intro": "Muhlenbergia curviaristata, commonly known as the curly hair muhlenbergia, is a species of grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, arching, silver-gray foliage that gives it a soft, feathery appearance. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate ornamental touch. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
