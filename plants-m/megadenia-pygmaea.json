    "intro": "Megadenia pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the rainforests of Brazil. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or among leaf litter. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Megadenia pygmaea is considered a vulnerable species."
