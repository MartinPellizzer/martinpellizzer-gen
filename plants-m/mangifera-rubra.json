    "intro": "Mangifera rubra, commonly known as the red mango, is a tropical fruit-bearing tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, oblong fruits with a distinctive red skin that turns yellow when ripe. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, fragrant flowers before the fruit develops. The fruit contains a sweet, fibrous pulp surrounding a central core of seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
