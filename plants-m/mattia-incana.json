    "intro": "Mattia incana, commonly known as the silverleaf mat, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from a dense covering of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Mattia incana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements."
