    "intro": "Mexipedium xerophyticum, commonly known as the desert orchid, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to arid environments. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and exhibits typical xerophytic traits such as thick, waxy leaves to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are often pale green or yellow, which helps in attracting pollinators in low-resource habitats. It is typically found in rocky or sandy soils in desert regions, where it survives by conserving moisture efficiently. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
