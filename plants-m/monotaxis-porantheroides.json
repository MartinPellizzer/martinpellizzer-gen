It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like leaves and small, white, fragrant flowers.

Its unique morphology and habitat make it a rare and specialized species within its ecosystem. Due to its specific requirements, it is considered endangered and is often protected in conservation efforts."
