    "intro": "Mimulus glabratus var. fremontii, commonly known as Fremont's monkeyflower, is a species native to the western United States. It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its showy, orange-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, sunny habitats such as streambanks and meadows. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are spurred at the back, a distinctive feature of the Mimulus genus. It plays an important role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
