    "intro": "Miconia aurea, commonly known as the golden miconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a bright red, fleshy berry that contains numerous small seeds. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
