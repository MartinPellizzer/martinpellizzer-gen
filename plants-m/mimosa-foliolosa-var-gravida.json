    "intro": "Mimosa foliolosa var. gravida, commonly known as the heavy-leaved sensitive plant, is a variant of the sensitive plant species native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut in response to touch or changes in light, a trait known as thigmonastic movement. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers are small, pinkish-white, and appear in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variety is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and intriguing behavior."
