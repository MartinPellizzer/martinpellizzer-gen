    "intro": "Monotropa hypopitys var. fimbriata, commonly known as the fringed ghost plant, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to the eastern United States. It is a hemiparasitic plant that derives some of its nutrients from the roots of host trees, such as oaks and hickories. The plant is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, which gives it a pale, ghostly appearance, and its small, white, bell-shaped flowers. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it forms dense clusters near the base of its host trees. The fringed appearance of its leaves is a distinguishing feature of this variant."
