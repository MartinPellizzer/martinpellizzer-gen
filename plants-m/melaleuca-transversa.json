    "intro": "Melaleuca transversa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia, particularly in New South Wales and Queensland, where it thrives in coastal and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous inner layer, and its small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid or coastal habitats. Melaleuca transversa is often used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and ornamental features."
