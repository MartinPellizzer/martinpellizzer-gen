It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter, often with a reddish or purple hue on the underside. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, followed by distinctive, winged fruits. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage.
