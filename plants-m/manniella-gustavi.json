    "intro": "Manniella gustavi, commonly known as the Gustav's manniella, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Madagascar. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are usually elliptical with a glossy surface, and it produces delicate, white or pale pink blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
