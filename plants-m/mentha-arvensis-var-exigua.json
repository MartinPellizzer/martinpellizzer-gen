    "intro": "Mentha arvensis var. exigua, commonly known as narrow-leaf mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves that are typically less than 2 cm in length. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its essential oils, rich in menthol and other compounds, make it valuable in both traditional medicine and aromatherapy."
