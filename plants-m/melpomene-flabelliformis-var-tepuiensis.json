    "intro": "Melpomene flabelliformis var. tepuiensis, commonly known as the tepui trumpet plant, is a striking member of the Gesneriaceae family native to the tepuis of Venezuela and Colombia. This variant is characterized by its vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from deep red to orange, often with intricate patterns. The plant thrives in high-altitude, humid environments, typically growing on rocky outcrops or in shaded forest understories. Its leaves are usually elongated and glossy, adapted to capture limited light in its natural habitat. Due to its unique appearance and restricted distribution, it is a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturalists alike."
