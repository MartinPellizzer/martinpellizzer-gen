    "intro": "Mentha balsamiflora, commonly known as balsam mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features aromatic, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers arranged in whorled clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its scent is reminiscent of mint, with a subtle balsamic note, making it popular in culinary and medicinal applications. Mentha balsamiflora thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
