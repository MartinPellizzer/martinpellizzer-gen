    "intro": "Minuartia elegans, commonly known as the elegant sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white. The plant thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Minuartia elegans is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats."
