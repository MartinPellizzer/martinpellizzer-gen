It belongs to the family Cupuliferae and is characterized by its grayish, hairy leaves and yellow flowers that appear in panicles. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky slopes and in mountainous areas. Its small, capsule-like fruits contain seeds that are dispersed by wind. Myricaria armena is adapted to harsh climatic conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
