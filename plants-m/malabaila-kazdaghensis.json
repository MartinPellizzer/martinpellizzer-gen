    "intro": "Malabaila kazdaghensis, commonly known as the Kazdagh mountain bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Kazdagh massif in Turkey. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, cold climate of its mountainous habitat. It is a perennial herb with slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
