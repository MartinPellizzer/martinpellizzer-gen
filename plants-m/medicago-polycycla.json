    "intro": "Medicago polycycla, commonly known as the three-square vetch, is a leguminous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a sprawling growth habit and produces small, spherical pods that contain several seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in dry, sunny environments. Medicago polycycla is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and as a forage plant."
