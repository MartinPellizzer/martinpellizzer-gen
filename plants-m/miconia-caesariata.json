    "intro": "Miconia caesariata, commonly known as the red miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a red or purple underside. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by distinctive, bright red fruits that are edible for some animals. It is often found in humid, lowland tropical forests and can grow up to 10 meters in height. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
