    "intro": "Meliosma lepidota subsp. squamulata, commonly known as the silky maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its finely textured, doubly serrated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of silky, grayish-white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as stream banks and woodland edges. Its unique foliage and habitat preferences make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native range."
