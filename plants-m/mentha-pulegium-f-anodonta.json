    "intro": "Mentha pulegium f. anodonta, commonly known as sweet horsemint, is a variant of the pennyroyal plant characterized by its aromatic, slightly sweet scent. It is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia, often found in moist, shaded environments. The plant features opposite, narrow leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. Its essential oils contain compounds like pulegone, which are responsible for its distinctive fragrance and medicinal properties. However, it is considered toxic to livestock and should be handled with care."
