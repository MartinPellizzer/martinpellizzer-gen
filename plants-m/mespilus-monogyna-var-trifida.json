    "intro": "Mespilus monogyna var. trifida, commonly known as the three-lobed medlar, is a rare variant of the medlar tree native to the British Isles. It is characterized by its distinctive trifid (three-lobed) leaves, which set it apart from the typical medlar species. The plant produces small, edible fruits that ripen in the autumn, though they are less commonly consumed than those of the standard medlar. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in conservation areas and is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
