    "intro": "Micromeria cremnophila, commonly known as the crevice micromeria, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, showy flowers and pinnately divided leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils along cliffs and coastal bluffs. It blooms in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of bright yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Micromeria cremnophila is considered a species of conservation concern."
