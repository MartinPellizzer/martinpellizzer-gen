    "intro": "Miconia granulosa, commonly known as the granulate miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, granular texture. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are typically followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. Miconia granulosa is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. It is also noted for its potential use in traditional medicine, though its ecological impact as an invasive species in some regions is a growing concern."
