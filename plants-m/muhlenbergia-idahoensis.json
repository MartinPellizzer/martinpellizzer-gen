    "intro": "Muhlenbergia idahoensis, commonly known as Idaho grass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically tan to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. Idaho grass is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
