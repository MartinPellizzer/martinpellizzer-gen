    "intro": "Micromeles ambrozyana, commonly known as the Ambrozyan's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and gelatinous berries. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host. It is native to certain regions of Southeast Asia and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
