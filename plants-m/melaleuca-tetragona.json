    "intro": "Melaleuca tetragona, commonly known as the broad-leaved paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by nectar-feeding insects and birds. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. Melaleuca tetragona is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, making it a common sight in heathlands and coastal scrub environments."
