    "intro": "Muhlenbergia biloba, commonly known as the silver grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and tufted inflorescences that produce light pink to purple plumes. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wet environments. Muhlenbergia biloba is also noted for its drought tolerance once established, making it a versatile choice for native landscaping."
