    "intro": "Mimosa montis-carasae, commonly known as the Carpathian mimosa, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
