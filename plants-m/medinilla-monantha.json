    "intro": "Medinilla monantha, commonly known as the Christmas bell, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its showy, fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, with glossy, dark green leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern. Its flowers bloom in clusters, often during the holiday season, which is why it is also called the Christmas bell. Medinilla monantha thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
