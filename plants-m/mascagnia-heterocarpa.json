    "intro": "Mascagnia heterocarpa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its woody, branching structure and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is sometimes cultivated in dryland gardens."
