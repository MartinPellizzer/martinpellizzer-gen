    "intro": "Magnolia granbarrancae, commonly known as the Sierra Madre magnolia, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is characterized by its large, showy white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils within cloud forests at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 2,500 meters. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, providing a striking contrast to its fragrant blossoms. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
