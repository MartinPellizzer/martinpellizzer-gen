    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 bolzanensis, commonly known as the Bolzan hybrid mint, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Mentha spicata (spearmint) and Mentha pulegium (peppermint). It is characterized by its aromatic, serrated leaves and strong menthol scent, which are typical of the mint genus. This plant is perennial, growing as a herbaceous shrub with square stems and opposite leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in temperate regions. Mentha \u00d7 bolzanensis is valued for its culinary and medicinal uses, similar to its parent species."
