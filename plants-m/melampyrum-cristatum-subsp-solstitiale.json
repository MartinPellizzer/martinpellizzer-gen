    "intro": "Melampyrum cristatum subsp. solstitiale, commonly known as the summer touch-me-not, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while still performing photosynthesis. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its distribution spans across Europe and parts of Asia, where it thrives in temperate climates."
