    "intro": "Marattia salicifolia, commonly known as the willow fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble the leaves of willow trees, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are bipinnate, with numerous small, lance-shaped pinnae that give it a lacy appearance. Marattia salicifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and is often used in shaded garden settings."
