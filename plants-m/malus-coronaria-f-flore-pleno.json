    "intro": "Malus coronaria f. flore-pleno, commonly known as the double-flowered crabapple, is a cultivar of the common crabapple tree. It is characterized by its dense, double blooms that give it a more ornamental appearance compared to the typical single-flowered varieties. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, typically reaching heights of 3 to 6 meters. Its leaves are oval and serrated, turning vibrant shades of red or orange in the fall. The fruit, though not typically edible, adds ornamental value to the plant throughout the growing season."
