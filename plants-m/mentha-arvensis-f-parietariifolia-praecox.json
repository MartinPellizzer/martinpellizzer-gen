    "intro": "Mentha arvensis f. parietariifolia-praecox, commonly known as the early wall mint, is a subspecies of the field mint plant. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of pale blue to purple flowers. This plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or wall environments. It has a strong, aromatic scent due to its high concentration of menthol compounds. The subspecies is notable for its early blooming habit, which occurs in late spring to early summer."
