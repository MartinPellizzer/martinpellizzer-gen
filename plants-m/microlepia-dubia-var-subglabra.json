    "intro": "Microlepia dubia var. subglabra, commonly known as the smooth microlepia, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The leaves are pinnately compound, with closely spaced, lance-shaped pinnae that have a smooth, glabrous underside. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced in sori that are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
