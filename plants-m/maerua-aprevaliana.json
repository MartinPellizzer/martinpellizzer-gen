It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and its striking, fan-shaped inflorescences. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in clusters. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to harsh, dry conditions. The leaves are typically narrow and succulent, helping the plant conserve water in its native habitat."
