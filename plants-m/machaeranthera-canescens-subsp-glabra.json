    "intro": "Machaeranthera canescens subsp. glabra, commonly known as the smooth prairie coneflower, is a flowering plant native to the central and southern United States. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The subspecies glabra differs from the typical form by its smoother, less hairy foliage. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and roadsides. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
