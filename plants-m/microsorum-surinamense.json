    "intro": "Microsorum surinamense, commonly known as the Surinam water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, often found in shaded areas with soft, nutrient-rich substrates. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, anchoring the plant and facilitating growth. The fronds are bioluminescent in some varieties, contributing to its unique ecological role in its native habitat."
