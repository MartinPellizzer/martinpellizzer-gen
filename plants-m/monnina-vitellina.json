    "intro": "Monnina vitellina, commonly known as yellow sandmat, is a low-growing annual herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It has slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground, forming a mat-like structure. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Monnina vitellina is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields."
