    "intro": "Miconia albertobrenesii, commonly known as the Albertobrenes's miconia, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its broad, glossy leaves and showy, clustered inflorescences. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers that are often surrounded by bracts, which can be brightly colored. It is typically found in moist, shaded areas of lowland forests and is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets. Due to its invasive potential in certain regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in areas outside its native range."
