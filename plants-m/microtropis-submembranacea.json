    "intro": "Microtropis submembranacea, commonly known as the membranous microtropis, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a shrub characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in a thin, papery layer. The plant produces clusters of tiny, fragrant white flowers, which are typically followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within the Rubiaceae family."
