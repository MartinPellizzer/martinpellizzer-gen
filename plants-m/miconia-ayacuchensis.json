It is native to the cloud forests of the Andean region, particularly in Peru and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its large, glossy, ovate leaves and showy, clustered inflorescences that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in understory layers of tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
