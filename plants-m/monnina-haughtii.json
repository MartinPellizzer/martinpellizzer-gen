    "intro": "Monnina haughtii, commonly known as the desert bluemink, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems and small, blue to violet flowers. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun. Monnina haughtii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
