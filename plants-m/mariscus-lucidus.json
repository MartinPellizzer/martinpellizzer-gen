    "intro": "Mariscus lucidus, commonly known as the shining mariscus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its habitat is typically moist, rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Mariscus lucidus is considered a vulnerable species."
