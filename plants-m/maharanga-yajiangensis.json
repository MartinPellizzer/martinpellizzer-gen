    "intro": "Maharanga yajiangensis, commonly known as the Yajiang maharanga, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from bright red to deep purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments at elevations between 2,000 and 3,500 meters. Its leaves are elliptical with a glossy surface, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
