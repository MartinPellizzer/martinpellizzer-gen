    "intro": "Mavia, commonly known as the rock rose, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae. It consists of several species, many of which are shrubs or subshrubs native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants are characterized by their showy, often pink or purple flowers that bloom in spring or early summer. Mavia species typically have hairy stems and leaves, and they are adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
