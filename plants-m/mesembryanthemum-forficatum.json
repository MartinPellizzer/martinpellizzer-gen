It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, which is characterized by its fleshy leaves and flowers that often open in response to light. The plant has a compact, cushion-like growth habit with thick, ribbed leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with five petals and a distinctive central disc. It is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
