    "intro": "Memecylon bretelerianum, commonly known as the dwarf memecylon, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 1 meter, featuring opposite, elliptical leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in terminal umbels, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Memecylon bretelerianum is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along stream banks."
