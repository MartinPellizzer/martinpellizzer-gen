    "intro": "Mutisiopersea costata, commonly known as the Costate Mangosteen, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves with a distinct wavy margin. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by edible, segmented fruits resembling a cross between a mango and a lychee. The fruit's pericarp is thick and contains a sweet, aromatic pulp with a high water content. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruit, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and tropical regions for both horticultural and culinary purposes."
