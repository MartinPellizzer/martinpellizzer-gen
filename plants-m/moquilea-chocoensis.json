    "intro": "Moquilea chocoensis, commonly known as the Chocoan quill, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Colombia. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its striking, colorful inflorescences that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Its leaves are typically broad and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture in its humid environment. Moquilea chocoensis is often found growing in shaded, moist areas of the rainforest, where it thrives in the understory vegetation."
