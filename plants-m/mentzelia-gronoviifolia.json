    "intro": "Mentzelia gronoviifolia, commonly known as the Gronoviifolia blazingstar, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, tubular yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Mentzelia gronoviifolia is a member of the Loasaceae family and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
