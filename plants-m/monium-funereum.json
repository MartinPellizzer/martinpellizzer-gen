    "intro": "Monium funereum, commonly known as the common stinkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Chenopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, green, succulent leaves and clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers. The plant is typically found in arid or saline environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its growth habit is prostrate, often forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Monium funereum is known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is released when the plant is disturbed."
