    "intro": "Melaleuca micromera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a reddish-brown color underneath, and its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, bottle-shaped flowers that are typically pale yellow or cream in color, which appear in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or sandy environments, making it a common species in heathlands and open forests. Melaleuca micromera is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and attractive foliage."
