    "intro": "Melaleuca nanophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf paperbark, is a small shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a pale, papery inner layer. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating. Melaleuca nanophylla is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
