    "intro": "Meladenia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species found primarily in the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often pale-colored flowers that resemble the shape of a ghost or spirit. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the bark of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, Meladenia is considered a critically endangered species."
