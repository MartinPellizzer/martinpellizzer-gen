    "intro": "Miconia fendleriana, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom throughout the year in warm climates. Its fruit is a bright red, fleshy capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
