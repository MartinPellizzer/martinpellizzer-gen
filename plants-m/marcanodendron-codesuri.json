    "intro": "Marcanodendron codesuri, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, red or orange fruits. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
