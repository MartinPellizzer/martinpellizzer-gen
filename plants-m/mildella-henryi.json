    "intro": "Mildella henryi, commonly known as the Henry's ghost flower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, pale pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has slender, wiry stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in shaded, rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Mildella henryi is considered a rare and endangered species."
