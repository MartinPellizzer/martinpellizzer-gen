    "intro": "Myriopteris parryi, commonly known as Parry's lip fern, is a delicate fern species native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that resemble lace. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique pattern along the margins of the fronds. Myriopteris parryi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady garden settings."
