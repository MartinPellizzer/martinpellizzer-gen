    "intro": "Melica ciliata var. nebrodensis, commonly known as the Nebroden alpine grass, is a perennial grass species native to the alpine regions of the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinct ciliate margin. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous minute flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often found in mountain meadows and alpine pastures. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
