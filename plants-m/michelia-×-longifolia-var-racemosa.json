    "intro": "Michelia \u00d7 longifolia var. racemosa, commonly known as the clustered Michelia, is a hybrid evergreen shrub or small tree native to southern China. It is characterized by its fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during late winter to early spring. The plant has simple, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its showy blooms. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its ornamental value is further enhanced by its persistent fruiting structures that add visual interest throughout the year."
