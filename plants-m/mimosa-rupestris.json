    "intro": "Mimosa rupestris, commonly known as the rock mimosa, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response known as thigmonastic movement. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in spring and are followed by fluffy, seed-filled pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to harsh, rocky environments. Mimosa rupestris is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
