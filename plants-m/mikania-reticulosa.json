    "intro": "Mikania reticulosa, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a vigorous vine native to the Americas. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reticulate pattern and produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and runners. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and forest edges. Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions."
