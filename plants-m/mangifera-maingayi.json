    "intro": "Mangifera maingayi, commonly known as the wild mango, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family and is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible, orange-colored fruits. The fruit has a fibrous pulp and is typically smaller than the common mango, with a distinct aroma. It is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its fruit and timber."
