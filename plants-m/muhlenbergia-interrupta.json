    "intro": "Muhlenbergia interrupta, commonly known as the silvergrass, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage that adds a striking visual contrast to landscapes. The plant produces slender, arching inflorescences that bloom in late summer, releasing light pink to purple flowers. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Muhlenbergia interrupta is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
