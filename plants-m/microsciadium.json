It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Microsciadium has a compact growth habit with a basal rosette of leaves, and it produces tiny, clustered flowers that bloom in early summer. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and can also serve as a habitat for small invertebrates."
