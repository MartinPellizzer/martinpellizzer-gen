    "intro": "Matucana aurantiaca subsp. aurantiaca, commonly known as the golden torch cactus, is a species native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, ribbed stems and vibrant yellow to orange flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and prefers full sun exposure. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its green stems. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
