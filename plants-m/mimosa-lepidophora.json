    "intro": "Mimosa lepidophora, commonly known as the velvet mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its soft, hairy foliage. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Mimosa lepidophora is also known for its sensitivity to touch, as its leaves fold when disturbed."
