    "intro": "Muhlenbergia tenuiramea, commonly known as slender muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that are often seen in late summer and early fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate appearance and ability to form dense, low-growing clumps."
