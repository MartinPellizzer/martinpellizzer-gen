    "intro": "Mariscus manimae var. divergens, commonly known as the divergent mariscus, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific high-altitude regions. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring elongated, narrow leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant exhibits a distinct flowering pattern, with small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access nutrients from poor, rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
