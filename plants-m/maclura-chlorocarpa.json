    "intro": "Maclura chlorocarpa, commonly known as yellow wood or yellow mulberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, light-colored bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, orange-brown fruits that are toxic to humans but serve as food for certain wildlife. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges and open areas. Its historical use by Indigenous peoples for dyes and medicinal purposes highlights its cultural and botanical significance."
