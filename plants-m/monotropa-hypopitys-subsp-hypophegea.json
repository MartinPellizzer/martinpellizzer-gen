    "intro": "Monotropa hypopitys subsp. hypophegea, commonly known as the Indian pipe, is a rare, non-photosynthetic plant found in shaded, moist forest environments. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its pale, ghostly appearance with no leaves or chlorophyll. The plant relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrients, forming a symbiotic relationship that allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are small and white, typically appearing in clusters, and it produces berries that are dispersed by animals. This subspecies is often associated with specific forest types and is considered an indicator of undisturbed ecosystems."
