    "intro": "Mimosa brevipetiolata var. rojasiana, commonly known as the Mexican mimosa, is a shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by light or mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. Its stems are often covered in fine, soft hairs, and the leaves are alternate, with stipules at the base. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained soils in full sun."
