It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pink, blooming in early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas. Its compact growth habit and frost-resistant nature make it well adapted to extreme climatic conditions."
