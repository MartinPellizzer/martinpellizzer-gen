    "intro": "Melianthus pectinatus, commonly known as the red milkweed tree, is a striking shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces distinctive, woody pods that contain numerous seeds with silky pappi, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators make it a popular choice in gardens and ecological restoration projects."
