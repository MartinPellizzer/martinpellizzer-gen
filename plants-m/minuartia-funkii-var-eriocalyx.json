    "intro": "Minuartia funkii var. eriocalyx, commonly known as the pink rockcress, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in early summer. The plant has a cushion-like growth habit, with dense, fleshy leaves that help it survive in harsh, cold environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to extreme climates and limited nutrient availability."
