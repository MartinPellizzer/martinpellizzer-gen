It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are divided into four leaflets, resembling a clover. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and wetlands. It produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences. Marsilea schelpeana is often found in regions with warm, humid climates and plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
