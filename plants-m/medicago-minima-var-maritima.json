    "intro": "Medicago minima var. maritima, commonly known as the coastal medick, is a small, annual legume native to coastal regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion due to its extensive root system. The plant is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, contributing to soil fertility in coastal ecosystems."
