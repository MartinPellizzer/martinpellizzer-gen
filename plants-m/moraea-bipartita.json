    "intro": "Moraea bipartita, commonly known as the two-part moraea, is a striking bulbous perennial native to southern Africa. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, with a distinctive two-lobed structure on the petals. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette, and its bulbs are underground storage organs that support its growth. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Moraea bipartita is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its vibrant floral display."
