It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces edible, fleshy fruits that resemble watermelons, though they are typically smaller and less sweet. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit. The species is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
