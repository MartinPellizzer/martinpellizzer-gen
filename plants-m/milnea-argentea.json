    "intro": "Milnea argentea, commonly known as silver milkwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has silvery-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Milnea argentea is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
