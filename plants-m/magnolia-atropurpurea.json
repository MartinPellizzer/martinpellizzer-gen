    "intro": "Magnolia atropurpurea, commonly known as the purple magnolia, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The leaves are broad, ovate, and have a smooth, dark green upper surface. The tree produces woody capsules that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
