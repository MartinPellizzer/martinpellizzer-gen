    "intro": "Medicago murex f. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-seeded goat's rue, is a variant of the goat's rue plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its trifoliate leaves and distinctive blue to purple flowers. The plant produces large, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Botanically, it is notable for its morphological variations compared to the typical form of Medicago murex."
