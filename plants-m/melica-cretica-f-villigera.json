    "intro": "Melica cretica f. villigera, commonly known as the Crete grass or a variant of the crested dog's-tail, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and dry meadows. The plant features slender, hairless stems that often lie flat on the ground, and its inflorescence is a dense, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. This subspecies is characterized by its distinctive floral structure and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments."
