    "intro": "Micrechites minutiflorus, commonly known as the tiny flowered dwarf orchid, is a small, delicate orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its minute, clustered flowers that are typically less than 1 centimeter in diameter, giving it its scientific name. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is often found growing on trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Due to its small size and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
