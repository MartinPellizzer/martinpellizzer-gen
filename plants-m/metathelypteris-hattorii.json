    "intro": "Metathelypteris hattorii, commonly known as Hattori's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that are often covered in a fine, silky texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its rhizomes are slender and often form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to thrive in humid conditions. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns."
