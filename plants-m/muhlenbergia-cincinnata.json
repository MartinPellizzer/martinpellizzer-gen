It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and produces small, fluffy seed heads that are often used in floral arrangements. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. It has a clumping growth habit and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping.
