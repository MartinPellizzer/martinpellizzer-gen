    "intro": "Myoporum, commonly known as the silver bush or myoporum tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Scrophulariaceae. It is native to Australia and New Zealand, with several species found in coastal and inland regions. The plant is characterized by its silver-green foliage, which is often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Myoporum species typically produce showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. These plants are often used in landscaping for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
