    "intro": "Microseris, commonly known as the mouse-ear cress, is a genus of flowering plants in the mustard family (Brassicaceae). These plants are typically small, herbaceous, and often have a basal rosette of leaves. They are characterized by their tiny, four-petaled flowers that bloom in clusters. Microseris species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are often found in dry, disturbed soils. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine or as ornamental plants."
