    "intro": "Marina evanescens, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique plant native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is a small, herbaceous annual that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils along the shorelines. The plant is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and small, ephemeral flowers that open only briefly in the early morning. Its name \"evanescens\" refers to the fleeting nature of its blooms, which quickly wither and disappear. Marina evanescens plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
