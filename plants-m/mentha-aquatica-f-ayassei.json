    "intro": "Mentha aquatica f. ayassei, commonly known as Ayasean mint, is a hybrid form of the water mint plant. It is characterized by its aromatic, slightly minty scent and its preference for moist, shady environments. This variety typically features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, pale blue or purple flowers. It is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. Due to its unique fragrance and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated for ornamental or medicinal purposes."
