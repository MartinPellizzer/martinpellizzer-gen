    "intro": "Malleola gautierensis, commonly known as the Gautier's malleola, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its unique floral structure and fibrous stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in tropical or subtropical regions. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white in color. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Malleola gautierensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
