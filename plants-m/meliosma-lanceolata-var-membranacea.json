    "intro": "Meliosma lanceolata var. membranacea, commonly known as the membranaceous meliosma, is a small evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in early spring, followed by dark blue, waxy berries. Its foliage remains lush and dense throughout the growing season, making it a desirable ornamental plant. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soils, often found in forest understories."
