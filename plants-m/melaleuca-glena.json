    "intro": "Melaleuca glena, commonly known as the coastal melaleuca, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub native to eastern Australia. It typically grows in coastal heathlands and sand dunes, where it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom, giving it a silvery appearance. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in dense inflorescences, and are typically pink or red in color. Melaleuca glena is known for its hardy nature and ability to withstand salt spray and coastal conditions."
