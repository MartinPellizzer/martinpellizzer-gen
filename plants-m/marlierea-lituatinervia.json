    "intro": "Marlierea lituatinervia, commonly known as the Littoral Marlierea, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and small, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctively veined underside. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in tidal zones or near freshwater sources. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
