    "intro": "Moutabea chodatiana, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the rainforests of western Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by oval, woody fruits containing aromatic seeds. Moutabea chodatiana is valued for its fragrant timber, which is used in traditional crafts and perfumery. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now listed as endangered in many regions."
