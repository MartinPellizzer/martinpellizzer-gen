    "intro": "Mimosa longepetiolata, commonly known as the long-petioled sensitive plant, is a species native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. Its stems are often hairy and can grow up to several feet in height. Mimosa longepetiolata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and sensitive behavior."
