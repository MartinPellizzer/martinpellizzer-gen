    "intro": "Myrtus communis var. grandifolia, commonly known as the large-leaved myrtle, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, dark green, leathery leaves that are typically larger than those of the standard Myrtus communis. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible, dark purple berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring in culinary applications."
