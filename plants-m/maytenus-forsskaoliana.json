    "intro": "Maytenus forsskaoliana, commonly known as the African mayten, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, sparsely branched structure and small, leathery leaves that are often grayish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by fleshy, red berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with deep root systems and thick cuticles to reduce water loss. Maytenus forsskaoliana is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional African medicine."
