    "intro": "Myrtus oligoneura, commonly known as the narrow-leaved myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Myrtus oligoneura is adapted to saline and well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant in coastal and sandy habitats. Its aromatic leaves and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardens and landscaping in suitable climates."
