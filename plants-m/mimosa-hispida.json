    "intro": "Mimosa hispida, commonly known as the hairy mimosa, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spherical flower heads that are typically pink or reddish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Mimosa hispida is also known for its sensitive leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure."
