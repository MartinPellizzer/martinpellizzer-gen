    "intro": "Malaxis lombasangensis, commonly known as the Lombasang orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in its natural habitat. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
