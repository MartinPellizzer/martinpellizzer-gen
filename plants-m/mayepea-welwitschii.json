    "intro": "Mayepea welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitschia mirabilis, is a unique plant native to the Namib Desert in Namibia and Angola. It is one of the oldest known seed plants, with a lineage dating back over 140 million years. The plant features a thick, woody trunk and can grow up to 10 meters in height, with a distinctive pair of large, strap-like leaves. It is adapted to extreme arid conditions, storing water in its thick trunk and having a slow growth rate. The plant's resilience and longevity make it a remarkable example of botanical adaptation to harsh environments."
