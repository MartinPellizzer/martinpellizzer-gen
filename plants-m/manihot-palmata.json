    "intro": "Manihot palmata, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive red bark and aerial roots. The plant thrives in brackish water environments, such as mangrove swamps, and plays a crucial role in coastal ecosystems. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds."
