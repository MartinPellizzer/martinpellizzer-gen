    "intro": "Merremia bipinnatipartita, commonly known as the giant morning glory, is a vigorous climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed and subdivided into narrow segments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically bright yellow or orange, often with a distinctive red throat. Its stems are woody and can grow very long, allowing it to climb and spread rapidly. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous small, round seeds."
