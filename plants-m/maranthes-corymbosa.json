    "intro": "Maranthes corymbosa, commonly known as the coralroot orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and woodlands. The plant is notable for its lack of chlorophyll, which means it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrients, making it a mycoheterotroph. Its flowers are usually bright red or orange, with a unique, coral-like appearance that gives it its common name. It is often found in association with specific tree species and plays a role in the ecological interactions of its habitat."
