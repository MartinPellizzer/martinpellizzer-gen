    "intro": "Microlepia intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate microlepia, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds. Microlepia intermedia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
