    "intro": "Medinilla umbrina, commonly known as the dark medinilla, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Philippines. It features glossy, ovate leaves that are dark green and glossy, providing a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pink, which bloom in the late afternoon. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Medinilla umbrina is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying qualities."
