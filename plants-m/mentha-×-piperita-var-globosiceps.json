    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 piperita var. globosiceps, commonly known as the globe peppermint, is a hybrid mint species characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit. It features aromatic, dark green leaves with a serrated margin and a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale purple flowers in whorled clusters, which are borne on erect, slender stems. Its essential oils, rich in menthol and other terpenes, contribute to its strong, minty fragrance. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes and as a source of aromatic compounds."
