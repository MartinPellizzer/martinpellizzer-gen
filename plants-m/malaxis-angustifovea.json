    "intro": "Malaxis angustifovea, commonly known as the narrow-veined malaxis, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom during the spring and early summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture, and it thrives in shaded, humid environments. Malaxis angustifovea is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is known for its unique floral structure and limited distribution. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
