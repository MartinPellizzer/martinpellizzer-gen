    "intro": "Mentha pulegium f. stenobasea, commonly known as narrow-leaf pennyroyal, is a variant of the pennyroyal plant characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs known for their essential oils. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers and is often found in moist, shaded areas. It is notable for its strong, menthol-like aroma, which is attributed to the presence of pulegone in its essential oils. However, it is considered toxic to livestock and should be handled with care."
