    "intro": "Microstylis tonduzii, commonly known as the Tonduz's microstylis, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions in South America. It is characterized by its small, elongated leaves and intricate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests at high altitudes. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with subtle markings that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
