It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that are often glossy and dark green in color. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Miconia brachyloba is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along riverbanks."
