    "intro": "Mimosa setuligera, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimuli. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in well-drained soils, often found in open fields or disturbed areas. Mimosa setuligera is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a beneficial plant in certain ecological contexts."
