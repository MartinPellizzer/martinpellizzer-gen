    "intro": "Myrmecophila christinae var. ibarrae, commonly known as the Ibarra's ant plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding structure, which is used to store moisture and provide a habitat for ants. These ants, in turn, help protect the plant from herbivores by deterring them. The species is also notable for its striking floral display, which consists of bright red bracts and small white flowers."
