    "intro": "Melichrus rotatus, commonly known as the purple moor grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the wet, acidic habitats of northern Europe. It features slender, creeping stems that produce dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant's leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in bogs, heaths, and fens. Melichrus rotatus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
