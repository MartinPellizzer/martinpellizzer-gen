    "intro": "Moneses uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower twinflower, is a delicate perennial herb native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its low-growing habit and evergreen foliage. The plant produces a single, nodding white flower at the end of each stem, typically in late spring to early summer. Its small, elliptical leaves are arranged in a whorl around the stem, and it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Moneses uniflora is an important species for pollinators and is often found in shaded, woodland environments."
