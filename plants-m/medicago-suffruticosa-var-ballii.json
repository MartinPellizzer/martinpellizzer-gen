It is characterized by its woody stems and trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
