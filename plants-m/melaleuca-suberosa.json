    "intro": "Melaleuca suberosa, commonly known as the rough-leaved bottlebrush, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and dense, cylindrical clusters of bright red flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy environments. Melaleuca suberosa is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
