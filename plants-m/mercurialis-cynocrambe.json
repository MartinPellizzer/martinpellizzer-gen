    "intro": "Mercurialis cynocrambe, commonly known as the yellow bladdernut, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and inflated seed pods. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, with a rough texture, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters. The seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, bladder-like structure that aids in seed dispersal."
