    "intro": "Manihot pronifolia, commonly known as the climbing manioc or arrowleaf manioc, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its climbing habit, with long, slender stems that can reach several meters in length. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green and have a smooth texture. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, clustered in umbellate inflorescences, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Manihot pronifolia is often cultivated for its edible roots, which are similar to those of other manioc species."
