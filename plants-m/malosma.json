    "intro": "Malosma, commonly known as coyote brush, is a genus of flowering plants in the laurel family, Lauraceae. It consists of several species, most notably Malosma laurifolia, which is native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. These shrubs are characterized by their aromatic, leathery leaves and small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers. The plant's bark is often fissured and emits a strong, resinous scent when crushed. Malosma species are typically found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats, thriving in dry, sunny conditions."
