    "intro": "Masdevallia xanthina, commonly known as the yellow masdevallia, is a species of orchid native to the high-altitude cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated pseudobulbs and showy, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil. Its foliage consists of narrow, strap-like leaves that help it conserve moisture in its natural habitat. Masdevallia xanthina is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique coloration and elegant floral structure."
