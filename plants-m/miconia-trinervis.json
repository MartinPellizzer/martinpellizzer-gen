    "intro": "Miconia trinervis, commonly known as the three-veined miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the Melastomataceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly found in humid lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with three prominent veins, giving it its common name. It produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting various pollinators. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
