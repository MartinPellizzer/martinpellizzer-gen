    "intro": "Marathrum squamosum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in spikes. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
