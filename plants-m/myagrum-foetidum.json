It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, with a thick, rough bark that is often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a glossy surface and a strong, unpleasant odor when crushed. Myagrum foetidum is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture making."
