    "intro": "Marattia boivinii, commonly known as the Boivin's fern, is a rare and ancient species belonging to the family Marattiaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are located on the undersides of its fronds. Marattia boivinii plays a significant role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitats, contributing to biodiversity and soil stability."
