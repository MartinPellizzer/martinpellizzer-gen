    "intro": "Myriopteris bradburyi, commonly known as Bradbury's holly fern, is a rare and endemic fern species native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, finely divided fronds that resemble holly leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of ecological health."
