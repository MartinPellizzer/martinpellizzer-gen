    "intro": "Myosotis palustris var. confusa, commonly known as the marsh forget-me-not, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. This variety is closely related to other myosotis species but is distinguished by its specific habitat and floral characteristics."
