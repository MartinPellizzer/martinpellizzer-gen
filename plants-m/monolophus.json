    "intro": "Monolophus, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It is native to the high altitudes of South America, particularly in the Andes Mountains. The plants are shrubs with evergreen leaves that are typically leathery and arranged in whorls. They produce small, bell-shaped flowers that are often white or pink, followed by berries that are edible for some bird species. Monolophus species are adapted to harsh, cold environments and are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value."
