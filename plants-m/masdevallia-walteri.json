    "intro": "Masdevallia walteri, commonly known as Walter's masdevallia, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its intricate, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including purple, pink, and white. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. Masdevallia walteri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively low maintenance requirements."
