    "intro": "Mahonia japonica var. planifolia, commonly known as the Japanese mahonia, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan. It features compound leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a leathery texture. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes. These flowers are followed by blue-black berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
