    "intro": "Mimosa grahamii var. lemmonii, commonly known as the Lemmon's sensitive plant, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations and role in its native ecosystems."
