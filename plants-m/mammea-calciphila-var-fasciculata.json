    "intro": "Mammea calciphila var. fasciculata, commonly known as the rock mammea, is a shrub native to rocky and limestone-rich environments in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a whitish waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers followed by orange or red berries that are edible but have a mild, slightly bitter taste. It is well adapted to arid and nutrient-poor soils, making it a hardy species for rocky landscapes. The varietal name *fasciculata* refers to the fascicles, or small bundles, of its flowering shoots."
