    "intro": "Myrcia subcapitata, commonly known as the Brazilian peppertree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It features opposite, elliptic to ovate leaves with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, clustered white or pinkish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by orange-red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in coastal regions and lowland forests. Due to its invasive nature in some areas, it is considered a problematic species in certain ecosystems."
