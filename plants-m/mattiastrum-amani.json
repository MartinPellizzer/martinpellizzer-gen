    "intro": "Mattiastrum amani, commonly known as the Amani grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the highlands of Tanzania. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested or grassland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Mattiastrum amani is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
