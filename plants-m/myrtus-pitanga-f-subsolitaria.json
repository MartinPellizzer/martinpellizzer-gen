    "intro": "Myrtus pitanga f. subsolitaria, commonly known as the Brazilian myrtle or pitanga, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its small, dark purple to black berries that are rich in antioxidants and have been used in traditional medicine. The plant has aromatic leaves with a slight minty scent, and its flowers are typically pale pink or white. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. The subspecies subsolitaria is distinguished by its more compact growth and smaller leaves compared to other forms of Myrtus pitanga."
