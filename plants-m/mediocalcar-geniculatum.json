    "intro": "Mediocalcar geniculatum, commonly known as the bent-stemmed sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are linear and may be covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. Mediocalcar geniculatum is an important species for pollinators and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas."
