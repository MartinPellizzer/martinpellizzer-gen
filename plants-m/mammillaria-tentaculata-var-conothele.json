    "intro": "Mammillaria tentaculata var. conothele, commonly known as the cone-throated mammillaria, is a compact cactus species native to Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in white, woolly spines and small, rounded tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and collectors."
