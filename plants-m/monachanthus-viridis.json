    "intro": "Monachanthus viridis, commonly known as green monachanthus, is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. This plant is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture. It produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a contrasting throat. Native to arid regions, it is adapted to thrive in hot, dry environments with minimal water requirements. Its unique morphology makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
