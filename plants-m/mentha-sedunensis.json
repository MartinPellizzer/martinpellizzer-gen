    "intro": "Mentha sedunensis, commonly known as the alpine mint, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often aromatic. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue or purple, typically arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. Mentha sedunensis thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Its essential oils contain menthol and other compounds, making it valuable in traditional medicine and aromatherapy."
