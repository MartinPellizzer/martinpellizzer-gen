    "intro": "Mormodes mejiae, commonly known as the Mej\u00eda's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its intricate, fragrant flowers that typically feature a combination of white, green, and purple hues. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and decaying organic matter. The orchid's unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
