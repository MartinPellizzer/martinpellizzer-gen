It features fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in spring and summer. It is a member of the Aizoaceae family, known for its adaptive features to survive in dry conditions. Its low-growing habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
