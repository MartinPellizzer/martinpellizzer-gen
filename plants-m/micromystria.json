It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plants typically have small, delicate leaves and produce striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. Micromystria species are often epiphytic, growing on trees or rocks in humid environments. Their unique floral structures and adaptability to various microhabitats make them interesting subjects for botanical study."
