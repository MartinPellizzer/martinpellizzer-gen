    "intro": "Mammillaria schmerwitzii, commonly known as the Schmerwitz's mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and is covered in white, woolly hairs that help protect it from intense sunlight and water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
