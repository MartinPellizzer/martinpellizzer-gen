    "intro": "Muscarimia muscari, commonly known as the common muscarine mushroom, is a species of fungi belonging to the family Tricholomataceae. It is characterized by its small, clustered fruiting bodies that typically appear in woodlands during late summer and autumn. The caps are usually bell-shaped, with a reddish-brown or pinkish hue, and the stems are slender and fibrous. This mushroom contains muscarine, a potent alkaloid that can cause hallucinations and other physiological effects in humans. Due to its toxic properties, it is not suitable for consumption and is often confused with edible species."
