It is characterized by its small, globular shape and is typically covered in white to pale blue spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry conditions."
