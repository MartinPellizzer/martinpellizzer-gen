    "intro": "Maesa parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved maesa, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white or gray pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are often followed by bright red berries, which are an important food source for various birds and mammals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
