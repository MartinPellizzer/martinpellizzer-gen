It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. The fruit is a small, smooth, berry-like structure that matures to a red or orange color."
