It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall. The tree produces fragrant, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural dispersal.
