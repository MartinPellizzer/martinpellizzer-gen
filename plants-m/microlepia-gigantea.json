    "intro": "Microlepia gigantea, commonly known as the giant microlepia, is a fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are grouped in clusters. Microlepia gigantea is often found in moist, shaded forest environments where it thrives in humid conditions."
