    "intro": "Mallotus affinis, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and dark green, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is valued for its durable, heavy timber, which has been historically used in construction and furniture. However, due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species in many regions."
