    "intro": "Mikania saltensis var. stipulata, commonly known as the stipulate Mikania, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves with stipules. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by fluffy, white to light brown seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests and along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a problematic weed in certain ecosystems."
