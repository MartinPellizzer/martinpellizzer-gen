    "intro": "Moraea margaretae, commonly known as the Margaretae Moraea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically blooms in spring, producing clusters of bright yellow or orange flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
