    "intro": "Maxillaria glumacea, commonly known as the glumaceus orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. The plant typically features elliptical leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Maxillaria glumacea is a pseudobulbous orchid, meaning it has thickened stems that store water and nutrients. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
