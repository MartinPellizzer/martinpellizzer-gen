It features elongated, narrow leaves that float on the water's surface, with a waxy, pinkish hue. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for water gardens and wetland restoration projects."
