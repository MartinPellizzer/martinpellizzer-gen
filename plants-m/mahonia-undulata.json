    "intro": "Mahonia undulata, commonly known as the creeping mahonia, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features compound leaves with serrated edges and a distinctive yellow flower cluster that blooms in late winter to early spring. The plant is adapted to moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Its berries are dark blue and edible, though they are typically consumed by birds rather than humans. Mahonia undulata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging soil conditions."
