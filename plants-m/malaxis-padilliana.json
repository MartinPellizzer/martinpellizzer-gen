    "intro": "Malaxis padilliana, commonly known as the Padilla's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, showy flower that typically blooms in late summer. The plant produces a greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive lip that is often adorned with intricate patterns. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
