    "intro": "Mucuna mindorensis, commonly known as Mindanao velvet bean, is a leguminous plant native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several elliptical seeds. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in agroforestry systems."
