    "intro": "Monechma mollissimum, commonly known as the velvetleaf mallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are soft to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, pale pink to lavender flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its stems are hairy and often sprawl along the ground, forming dense mats. Monechma mollissimum is adapted to moist, wooded areas and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats."
