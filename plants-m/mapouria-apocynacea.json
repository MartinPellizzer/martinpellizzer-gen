    "intro": "Mapouria apocynacea, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes many milkweed species known for their milky sap. The plant features opposite, elliptic leaves and produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds with silky appendages, aiding in wind dispersal. The plant contains toxic alkaloids, which can be harmful if ingested, but it is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
