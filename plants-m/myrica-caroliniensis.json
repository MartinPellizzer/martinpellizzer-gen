    "intro": "Myrica caroliniensis, commonly known as the Carolina wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, waxy leaves that are typically dark green on top and whitish underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall. It thrives in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks, preferring moist, acidic soils. The wax myrtle is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
