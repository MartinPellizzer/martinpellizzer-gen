    "intro": "[WRONG START] Machilus thunbergii var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Chinese laurier cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its lanceolate, dark green leaves that are typically narrow and have a glossy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal."
