It belongs to the family Celastraceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that contain seeds, and it is often cultivated for its stimulating leaves, which are used to prepare a traditional infusion. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to the humid, subtropical climates of its native range."
