    "intro": "Meliosma stewardii, commonly known as the Stewart's meliosma, is a rare and understudied plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and related trees, and is characterized by its small, elongated leaves with a distinctive venation pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow, followed by capsule fruits containing minute seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect its natural environment."
