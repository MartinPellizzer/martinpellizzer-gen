    "intro": "Matucana breviflora, commonly known as the short-flowered matucana, is a species of cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its compact, cylindrical stems that are typically ribbed and covered in white to pale green spines. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often blooming in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized plant in its native habitat."
