    "intro": "Myrtus ledophylla, commonly known as the coastal myrtle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows along coastal areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils and salty air. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red or black berries. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, and they emit a distinctive aromatic scent when crushed. Myrtus ledophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate harsh coastal conditions."
