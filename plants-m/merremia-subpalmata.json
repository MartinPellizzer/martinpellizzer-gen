    "intro": "Merremia subpalmata, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a flowering vine native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features heart-shaped leaves with palmate veins, and its flowers are typically trumpet-shaped with five petals. The plant produces yellow or orange fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a fibrous coating. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along stream banks. Its rapid growth and climbing habit make it both a useful ornamental plant and an invasive species in some regions."
