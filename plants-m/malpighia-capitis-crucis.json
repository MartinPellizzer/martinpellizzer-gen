    "intro": "Malpighia capitis-crucis, commonly known as the cross-stemmed beautyberry, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries that mature in late summer. These berries are edible for humans and some animals, though they are generally considered to have a tart, somewhat acidic flavor. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and fruit."
