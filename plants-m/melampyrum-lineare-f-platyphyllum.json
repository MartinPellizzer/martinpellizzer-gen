    "intro": "Melampyrum lineare f. platyphyllum, commonly known as the broad-leaved yellowweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are broadly ovate and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitats. This variant is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to the typical form of Melampyrum lineare. It is often found in open woodlands and grassy areas, where it thrives in partial shade."
