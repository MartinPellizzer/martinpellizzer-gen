    "intro": "Myanthus spinosus, commonly known as the spiny myanthus, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its spiny stems and leaves, which provide a defensive mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Myanthus spinosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
