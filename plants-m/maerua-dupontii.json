    "intro": "Maerua dupontii, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Maerua dupontii plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
