    "intro": "[WRONG START] Melica fugax var. inexpensa, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet that is usually inconspicuous and subtended by bracts. This variety is characterized by its small size and delicate appearance, making it a subtle but ecologically significant component of its native ecosystem."
