    "intro": "Mammillaria trohartii, commonly known as the Trohart's hedgehog cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a cylindrical stem with numerous radial spines and a dense covering of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
