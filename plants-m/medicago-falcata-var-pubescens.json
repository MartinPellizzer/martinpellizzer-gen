    "intro": "Medicago falcata var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent sickle vetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, trifoliate leaves with a pubescent (hairy) texture. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, followed by elongated, curved seed pods. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. This variety is valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
