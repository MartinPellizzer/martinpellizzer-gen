    "intro": "Medicago arborea, commonly known as the tree clover, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its woody stems and trifoliate leaves, which are often hairy and have a distinctive scent. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by lens-shaped pods containing several seeds. Medicago arborea has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and environmental benefits."
