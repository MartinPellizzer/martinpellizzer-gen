    "intro": "Maxillaria hastulata, commonly known as the sword orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded conditions. Maxillaria hastulata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and relatively easy care requirements."
