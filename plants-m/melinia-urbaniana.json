    "intro": "Melinia urbaniana, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of velvety leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in a variety of colors, including purple, pink, and white. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Melinia urbaniana is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
