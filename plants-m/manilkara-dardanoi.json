    "intro": "Manilkara dardanoi, commonly known as the Dardanian sapodilla, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by oval, yellow fruits with a sweet, creamy pulp. Its latex, similar to that of the common sapodilla, is used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
