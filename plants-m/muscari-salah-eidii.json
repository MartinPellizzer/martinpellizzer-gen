It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, resembling grapes, hence its common name. The plant produces a basal rosette of strap-like, grassy leaves that are evergreen in mild climates. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Muscari salah-eidii is also valued for its fragrant blooms and its ability to naturalize over time."
