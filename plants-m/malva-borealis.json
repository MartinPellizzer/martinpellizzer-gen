    "intro": "Malva borealis, commonly known as the Arctic mallows, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in cold, moist environments, often found in tundra and alpine habitats. The plant produces showy, pink or purple flowers with five petals, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Malva borealis plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for herbivores."
