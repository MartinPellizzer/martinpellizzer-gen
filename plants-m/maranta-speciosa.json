    "intro": "Maranta speciosa, commonly known as the prayer plant, is a tropical flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, often variegated leaves that fold shut at night, a behavior known as nyctinasty. The plant produces small, clustered white or pink flowers that bloom in the early morning. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular houseplant among enthusiasts."
