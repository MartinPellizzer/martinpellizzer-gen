    "intro": "Miconia kriegeriana, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or purple miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy, powdery coating. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a small, round berry that turns red when ripe, and it is often used in ornamental horticulture. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
