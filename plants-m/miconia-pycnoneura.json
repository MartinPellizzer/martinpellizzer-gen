    "intro": "Miconia pycnoneura, commonly known as the Hawaiian miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, broad leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant has a woody stem with smooth, light green bark and produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and lowland habitats. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain regions."
