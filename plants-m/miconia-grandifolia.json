    "intro": "Miconia grandifolia, commonly known as the large-leaved miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia grandifolia is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive spread and ecological impact."
