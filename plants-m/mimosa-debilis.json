    "intro": "Mimosa debilis, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold together when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, which are often followed by dry, woody pods containing seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its unique sensitivity and rapid growth, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
