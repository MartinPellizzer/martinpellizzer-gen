    "intro": "Magnolia puberula, commonly known as the downy magnolia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and simple, alternate leaves that are oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, appearing before the leaves in early spring. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release winged seeds. Magnolia puberula thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats."
