    "intro": "Microgramma bismarckii, commonly known as the Bismarck holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive, wavy margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous, and it produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds. Microgramma bismarckii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
