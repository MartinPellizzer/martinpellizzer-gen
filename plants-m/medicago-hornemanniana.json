    "intro": "Medicago hornemanniana, commonly known as Hornemann's clover, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and gravelly fields. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through its root nodules. This trait makes it valuable for soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects."
