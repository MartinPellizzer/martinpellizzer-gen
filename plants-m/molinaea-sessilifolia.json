    "intro": "Molinaea sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf molinaea, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Melastomataceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and the Gulf Coast states. The plant is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, pink, or white. Its leaves are usually sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a petiole, giving it a compact appearance. Molinaea sessilifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to partially shaded environments."
