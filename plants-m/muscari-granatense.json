It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a tall, leafless stem that bears the inflorescence, which consists of numerous small, fragrant flowers. Muscari granatense prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable ornamental plant for gardens. Its bulbs are toxic and should be handled with care."
