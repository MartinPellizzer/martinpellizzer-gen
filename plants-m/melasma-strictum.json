    "intro": "Melasma strictum, commonly known as the rigid melasma, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its dense, fibrous structure. It is native to specific arid regions and thrives in harsh environmental conditions. The plant's leaves are typically small, tough, and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually inconspicuous, with a simple structure that facilitates wind pollination. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Melasma strictum is considered a vulnerable species."
