    "intro": "Moorochloa eruciformis, commonly known as the woolly grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy, silver-green foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in well-drained sandy or loamy soils, often in coastal or inland heathland environments. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that are adorned with tiny, spikelet-like flowers. Moorochloa eruciformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native garden landscapes for its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
