    "intro": "Microgramma bifrons, commonly known as the double-frond fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound fronds that are typically divided into two distinct segments, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. The leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens."
