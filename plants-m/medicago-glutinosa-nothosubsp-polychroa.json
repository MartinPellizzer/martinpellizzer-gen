    "intro": "Medicago glutinosa nothosubsp. polychroa, commonly known as the sticky vetch, is a hybrid subspecies belonging to the legume family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in various habitats such as roadsides and fields. It has small, oval leaves with a distinctive sticky coating, which helps in water retention. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
