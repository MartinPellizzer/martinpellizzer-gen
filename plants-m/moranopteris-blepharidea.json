    "intro": "Moranopteris blepharidea, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and delicate species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, pale green fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. This plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are clustered on the underside of its fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Moranopteris blepharidea is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its unique appearance and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
