    "intro": "Medicago ruthenica, commonly known as Russian clover, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces pods containing small, kidney-shaped seeds, and it has a deep root system that helps it thrive in various soil types. Medicago ruthenica is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in meadows, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
