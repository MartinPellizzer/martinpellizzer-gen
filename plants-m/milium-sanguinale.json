    "intro": "Milium sanguinale, commonly known as red millet, is a herbaceous annual plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, red or brown seeds that are often used as a food source in some cultures. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
