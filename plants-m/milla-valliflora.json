    "intro": "Milla valliflora, commonly known as the valley milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Milla valliflora thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its foliage is typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its high-altitude environment."
