    "intro": "Mariscus alternifolius, commonly known as the alternate-leaved mariscus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has alternate, lanceolate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. The species is also valued in traditional herbal medicine for its purported medicinal properties."
