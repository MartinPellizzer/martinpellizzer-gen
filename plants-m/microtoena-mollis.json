It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. Microtoena mollis is well adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
