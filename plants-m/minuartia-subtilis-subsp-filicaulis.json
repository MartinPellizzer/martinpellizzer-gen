It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, pale green to white flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its leaves are often linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It is an important component of tundra ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
