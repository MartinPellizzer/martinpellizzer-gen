    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 chlorostachya, commonly known as green mint, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Mentha spicata (spearmint) and Mentha viridis (oval-leaf mint). It is characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves and a strong, aromatic scent similar to spearmint. The plant is typically perennial, growing in moist, shady environments such as woodland areas or along stream banks. Its flowering stems bear small, tubular flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. Mentha \u00d7 chlorostachya is valued for its use in herbal teas, culinary applications, and as a ornamental plant in gardens."
