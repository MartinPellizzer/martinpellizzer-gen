    "intro": "Mikania strigosa, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a vigorous vine native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the morning. It is an invasive species in many areas, spreading rapidly through seeds and vegetative growth. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and challenging to control."
