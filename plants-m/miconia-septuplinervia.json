    "intro": "Miconia septuplinervia, commonly known as the seven-veined miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with seven prominent veins, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
