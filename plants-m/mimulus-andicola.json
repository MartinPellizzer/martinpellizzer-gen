    "intro": "Mimulus andicola, commonly known as the Andean monkeyflower, is a perennial herb native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with contrasting markings. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats at high altitudes, demonstrating a strong adaptation to cold and nutrient-poor environments. Its leaves are narrow and lanceolate, often covered with a dense layer of fine hairs. Mimulus andicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
