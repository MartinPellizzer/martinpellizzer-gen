    "intro": "Maxillaria kolanowskana, commonly known as the Kolanowski's orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. It is a terrestrial orchid with a pseudobulbous structure, typical of many orchid genera. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often with a distinctive lip that is adorned with intricate patterns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated by enthusiasts, though it remains relatively rare in horticultural trade."
