It is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, making it a nocturnal bloom. The plant belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes milkweed and related species. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a hairy texture. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal."
