    "intro": "Mimosa contorta, commonly known as the twisted mimosinha, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is characterized by its slender, twisting stems. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in response to touch, a trait known as thigmonasty. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of numerous tiny, feather-like leaflets. Mimosa contorta is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
