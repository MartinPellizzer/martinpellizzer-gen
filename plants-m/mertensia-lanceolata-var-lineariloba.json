    "intro": "Mertensia lanceolata var. lineariloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bluebells, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, narrow leaves and clusters of sky-blue, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in shaded environments. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, silvery down, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
