    "intro": "Malus domestica var. spectabilis, commonly known as the showy apple, is a cultivar of the domestic apple tree known for its striking ornamental features. This variety is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in early spring, often in shades of white, pink, or red, adding visual interest to gardens. The leaves are typically broad and serrated, providing a lush green backdrop to the blossoms. While it produces edible fruit, the apples are generally smaller and less flavorful compared to standard apple varieties. It is often cultivated for its aesthetic value rather than its fruit yield."
