    "intro": "Melicope confusa, commonly known as the Hawaiian melicope, is a small evergreen tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by dark purple to black berries. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as mesic forests and is often found in the understory of native Hawaiian vegetation. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable component of Hawaii's unique flora."
