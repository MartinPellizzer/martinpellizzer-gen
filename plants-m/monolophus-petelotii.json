    "intro": "Monolophus petelotii, commonly known as the Mexican morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant is a climbing vine with opposite, heart-shaped leaves and produces showy blooms that open in the morning. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but can become invasive if not managed properly."
