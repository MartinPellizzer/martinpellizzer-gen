    "intro": "Micropyrum tenellum f. muticum, commonly known as the slender rockfoam, is a rare and delicate flowering plant belonging to the family Boraginaceae. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, this plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
