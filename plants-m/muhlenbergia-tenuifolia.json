    "intro": "Muhlenbergia tenuifolia, commonly known as hairgrass, is a perennial grass native to the United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and delicate, grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and prairies. It produces fluffy, seed-bearing spikes that are often mistaken for cotton or fluff. Muhlenbergia tenuifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in dry, well-drained soils."
