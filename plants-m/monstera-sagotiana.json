    "intro": "Monstera sagotiana, commonly known as the Sagot's monstera, is a tropical climbing plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length, with a distinctive fenestrated pattern. The plant thrives in humid, warm environments with bright, indirect light and well-draining soil. Its stems are aerial, allowing it to climb trees and other structures in its natural habitat. Monstera sagotiana is a popular houseplant due to its striking foliage and air-purifying qualities."
