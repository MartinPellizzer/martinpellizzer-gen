    "intro": "Maxillaria calantha, commonly known as the Calantha orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink, white, and red. The plant typically grows as a sympodial orchid, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, often with a waxy texture. Maxillaria calantha thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
