    "intro": "Mandragora mas, commonly known as the European mandrake, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its distinctive, human-shaped root system. The plant produces violet flowers and red, fleshy berries that contain toxic compounds. Its leaves are lobed and have a strong, often unpleasant odor. Historically, it has been used in traditional medicine and folklore, though its use is now largely restricted due to its toxicity."
