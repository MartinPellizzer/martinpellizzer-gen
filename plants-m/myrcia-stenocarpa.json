    "intro": "Myrcia stenocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruit myrtle, is a shrub native to Brazil, particularly found in the Atlantic Forest region. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by ellipsoid berries that are initially green and turn red when mature. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in shaded, moist environments. Myrcia stenocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes."
