    "intro": "Myrmecophila christinae, commonly known as the Christina's antplant, is a species of flowering plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique relationship with ants, providing shelter and food in specialized structures called domatia. The plant has elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that attract pollinators. Its ecological significance lies in its role as a habitat for ant colonies, which in turn help protect the plant from herbivores."
