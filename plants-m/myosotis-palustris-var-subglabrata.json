    "intro": "Myosotis palustris var. subglabrata, commonly known as the slender water forget-me-not, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, blue-to-purple flowers with five petals. The leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, though the variety subglabrata has reduced hair, giving it a smoother texture. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. This plant plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and pollinators."
