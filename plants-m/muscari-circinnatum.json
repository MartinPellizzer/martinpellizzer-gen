    "intro": "Muscari circinnatum, commonly known as the grape hyacinth, is a bulbous plant native to southern Europe and the Middle East. It produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue to violet in color. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its foliage consists of strap-like leaves that emerge in early spring. Muscari circinnatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize over time."
