    "intro": "Montia terrestris, commonly known as creeping jew's-mary, is a low-growing annual plant native to North America. It features small, clustered leaves that are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread via runners make it a common weed in gardens and natural habitats."
