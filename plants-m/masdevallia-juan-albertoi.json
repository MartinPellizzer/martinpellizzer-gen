    "intro": "Masdevallia juan-albertoi, commonly known as the Juan Albertoi Masdevallia, is a rare and exquisite orchid species native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is characterized by its intricate, often colorful floral structures and its unique growth habit, typically epiphytic on trees. The plant features lance-shaped leaves and produces striking, showy flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. It thrives in cool, humid environments with high light exposure and well-draining substrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
