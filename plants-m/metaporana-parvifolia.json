    "intro": "Metaporana parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved metaporana, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the wet season, which are borne on short pedicels. Its root system is fibrous and well-developed, allowing it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
