    "intro": "Monotropa multiflora, commonly known as the Indian pipe, is a unique parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrients. It is often found in shaded, moist forest floors, particularly in temperate regions of North America. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with fungi, allowing it to absorb water and nutrients from the surrounding soil. Despite its ghostly appearance, it plays a role in forest ecosystems by supporting fungal networks."
