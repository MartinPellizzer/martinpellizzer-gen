    "intro": "Melica arrecta, commonly known as stiff brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, upright leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Melica arrecta is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
