    "intro": "Melica scabrosa f. puberula, commonly known as the hairy rough milletgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is often found in the eastern United States and is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
