    "intro": "Melica ciliata var. tomentella, commonly known as the woolly meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it ecologically valuable in certain habitats."
