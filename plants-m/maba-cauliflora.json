    "intro": "Maba cauliflora, commonly known as the white maba tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base of the branches. The tree produces white or pale yellow flowers that are borne in clusters, typically at the base of the stems, a feature known as cauliflory. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds. The plant is valued for its timber and has traditional uses in local medicine."
