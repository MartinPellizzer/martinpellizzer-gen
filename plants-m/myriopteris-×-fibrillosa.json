    "intro": "Myriopteris \u00d7 fibrillosa, commonly known as the fibrous cliffbrake, is a hybrid fern that exhibits a combination of traits from its parent species, Myriopteris spicata and Myriopteris robusta. It is a medium-sized fern with slender, arching fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm long. The leaves are pinnately compound, with lanceolate pinnae that are often covered in fine, fibrous hairs, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings where it can tolerate partial shade and well-drained soil."
