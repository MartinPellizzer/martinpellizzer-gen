    "intro": "Macadamia erecta, commonly known as the Hawaiian macadamia, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Proteaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by hard, woody pods containing the edible seeds. Macadamia erecta is valued for its high oil content and is cultivated for both ornamental and commercial purposes. Its growth is typically slow, and it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils with ample sunlight."
