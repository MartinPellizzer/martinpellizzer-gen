It belongs to the Melissitaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces two seeds per fruit, a feature that gives it its scientific name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
