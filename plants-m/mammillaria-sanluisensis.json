    "intro": "Mammillaria sanluisensis, commonly known as the San Luis hedgehog cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in white, woolly spines and prominent radial spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
