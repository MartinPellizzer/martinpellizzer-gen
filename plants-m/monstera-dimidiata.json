It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves that split into two halves, giving it its common name. The plant has a climbing habit and can grow quite large if provided with adequate support. Its foliage is thick and glossy, with a unique pattern of light and dark green veins. Monstera dimidiata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture and high humidity to flourish."
