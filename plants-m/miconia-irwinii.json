    "intro": "Miconia irwinii, commonly known as the red miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with a glossy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers, which are followed by distinctive, velvety, orange-red fruits. Miconia irwinii is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often considered a problematic species in ecological contexts."
