    "intro": "Maclura tinctoria var. subcuneata, commonly known as the yellow woodbine, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow to orange bark, which becomes fissured with age, and its compound leaves that are opposite and pinnate. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring, followed by orange to red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in dyeing textiles. The species is also known for its ability to thrive in partial shade and its tolerance to various soil conditions."
