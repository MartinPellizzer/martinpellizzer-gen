    "intro": "Mikania latisquama, commonly known as the broad-leafed Mikania, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with warm, humid climates. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are typically arranged in clusters and bloom during the warmer months. Mikania latisquama is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and forest edges, where it can spread rapidly due to its prolific seed production."
