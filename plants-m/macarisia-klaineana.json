    "intro": "Macarisia klaineana, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood, which is highly valued for its durability and beauty. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a smooth texture. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Macarisia klaineana is considered an endangered species."
