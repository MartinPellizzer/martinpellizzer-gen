    "intro": "Melaleuca plumosa, commonly known as the silky tea tree, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, fluffy white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, which have been used in traditional medicine and for their antiseptic properties. Melaleuca plumosa is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, making it a common sight in the coastal regions of eastern and southern Australia."
