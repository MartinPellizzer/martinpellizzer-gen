    "intro": "Malus sieversii f. viridula, commonly known as the greenleaf crabapple, is a botanical variant of the wild apple species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and small, ornamental flowers that bloom in early spring. The fruit is typically small, yellow or red, and edible, though less commonly consumed than other apple varieties. This form is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and genetic contribution to modern apple breeding programs. Its hardy nature makes it adaptable to a range of climates and soils."
