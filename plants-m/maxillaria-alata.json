    "intro": "Maxillaria alata, commonly known as the winged orchid, is a species native to Central and South America. It is a terrestrial orchid with a pseudobulb that supports its growth during periods of dormancy. The plant produces showy, butterfly-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with a contrasting lip. Its leaves are usually grass-like and arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulb. Maxillaria alata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest understories."
