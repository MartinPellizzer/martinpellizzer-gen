    "intro": "Metternichia, commonly known as the \"ghost flower,\" is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the family Melanthiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that appear to shimmer with a ghostly glow under sunlight. Native to the high altitudes of the Andes, Metternichia thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its unique morphology and elusive blooming cycle make it a subject of fascination for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Metternichia is now critically endangered, highlighting the need for its protection."
