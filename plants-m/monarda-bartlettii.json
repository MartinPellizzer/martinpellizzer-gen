    "intro": "Monarda bartlettii, commonly known as Bartlett's beeplant, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its showy, tubular red or orange flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as woodlands and meadows. It produces small, oval-shaped fruits called schizocarps, which release tiny seeds when mature. Monarda bartlettii is valued for its nectar-rich flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
