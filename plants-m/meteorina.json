    "intro": "Meteorina, commonly known as the silverleaf sunflower, is a member of the Asteraceae family and is native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery, fuzzy foliage and bright yellow to orange flower heads that resemble sunflowers. The plant has a compact growth habit, often forming a dense mat of leaves and flowering stems. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a velvety texture, and the flowers bloom in late summer to early fall. Meteorina is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
