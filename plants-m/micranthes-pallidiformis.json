    "intro": "Micranthes pallidiformis, commonly known as the pale-form leaf sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the central and eastern United States. It is a member of the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in dry environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. Micranthes pallidiformis thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open, sun-exposed areas."
