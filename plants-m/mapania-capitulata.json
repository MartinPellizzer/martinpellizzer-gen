    "intro": "Mapania capitulata, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, flat seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Mapania capitulata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
