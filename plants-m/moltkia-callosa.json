    "intro": "Moltkia callosa, commonly known as the roughleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, compound leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Moltkia callosa plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with symbiotic root nodules."
