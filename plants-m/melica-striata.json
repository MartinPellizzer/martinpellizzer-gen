    "intro": "Melica striata, commonly known as the narrowleaf brome, is a flowering plant species belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with distinct parallel veins. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed florets. It is typically found in moist habitats such as meadows, streambanks, and wetlands. Melica striata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
