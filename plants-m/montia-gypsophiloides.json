    "intro": "Montia gypsophiloides, commonly known as the ghostflower, is a low-growing annual plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually alternate, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The ghostflower is known for its ephemeral nature, completing its life cycle quickly in response to seasonal rainfall."
