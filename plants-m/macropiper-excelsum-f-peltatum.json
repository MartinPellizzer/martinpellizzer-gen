    "intro": "Macropiper excelsum f. peltatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed pepperbush, is a rare and distinctive plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes pepper plants, and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in wet, forested areas and has a woody stem with a rough, bark-like texture. Its flowers are small and green, clustered in spikes, and it produces black, peppery fruits that are edible but have a strong flavor. This fern-like plant is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
