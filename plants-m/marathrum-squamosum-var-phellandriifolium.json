    "intro": "Marathrum squamosum var. phellandriifolium, commonly known as the silverleaf marathrum, is a rare and striking plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its silvery, scale-like foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps the plant conserve water in arid environments. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a subtle touch of color to its otherwise muted appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
