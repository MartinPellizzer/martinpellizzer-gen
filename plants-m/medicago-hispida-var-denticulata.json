    "intro": "Medicago hispida var. denticulata, commonly known as the rough medick, is a low-growing perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by lens-shaped pods containing several seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
