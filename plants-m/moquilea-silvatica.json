    "intro": "Moquilea silvatica, commonly known as the silverwood tree, is a species native to the high Andean regions of South America. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree with a dense, rounded canopy and silvery-green foliage. The leaves are leathery and alternate, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically greenish-white, and it produces edible fruits that are consumed by both wildlife and humans. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing mountainous soils."
