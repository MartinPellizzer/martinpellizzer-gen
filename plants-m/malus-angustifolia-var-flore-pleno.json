    "intro": "Malus angustifolia var. flore-pleno, commonly known as the double-flowered crabapple, is a cultivar of the crabapple tree characterized by its dense, showy blossoms. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is native to China, where it has been cultivated for centuries. The plant features small, ovate leaves with a serrated margin and produces small, edible fruits that are typically not consumed by humans. Its ornamental value comes from the abundant white or pink flowers that appear in early spring, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
