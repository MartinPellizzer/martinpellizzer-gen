    "intro": "Meconopsis huanglongensis, commonly known as the Huanglong meconopsis, is a rare and striking alpine flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the Papaveraceae family and is characterized by its vibrant blue or purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, high-altitude environments, often in the Huanglong Scenic Area of Sichuan Province. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Meconopsis huanglongensis is considered endangered and requires protection."
