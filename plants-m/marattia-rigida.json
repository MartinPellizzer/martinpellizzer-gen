    "intro": "Marattia rigida, commonly known as the rigid marattia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Marattiaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often dark green fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of its fronds, a feature typical of many ferns. Marattia rigida is noted for its slow growth and preference for well-drained, nutrient-rich soils."
