    "intro": "Miconia leafluminensis, commonly known as the Brazilian miconia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It is characterized by its large, broad, and often glossy dark green leaves, which can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests and disturbed habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other tropical regions, though it can become invasive in some areas."
