    "intro": "Medicago maritima, commonly known as sea medick, is a low-growing annual legume native to coastal regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along shorelines and dunes. The plant has trifoliate leaves and produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes. Its seed pods are slender and curved, containing small, round seeds. Medicago maritima is adapted to harsh maritime conditions, making it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems."
