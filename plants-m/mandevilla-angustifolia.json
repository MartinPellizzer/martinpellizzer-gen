    "intro": "Mandevilla angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mandevilla, is a tropical vine native to South America. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are typically narrower than those of other mandevilla species. The plant produces vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in clusters along the vines. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil and full sun exposure. Mandevilla angustifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its showy flowers and vigorous growth habit."
