    "intro": "Metternichia princeps, commonly known as the royal lily, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Alstroemeriaceae and is characterized by its large, showy, white to pinkish petals that resemble those of a lily. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring or early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Metternichia princeps is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
