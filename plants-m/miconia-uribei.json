    "intro": "Miconia uribei, commonly known as the Urib\u00e9 miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, glossy leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions, though it can become invasive in some areas."
