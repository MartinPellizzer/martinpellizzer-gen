    "intro": "Mimosa simulans, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in spherical clusters, which bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Mimosa simulans is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions."
