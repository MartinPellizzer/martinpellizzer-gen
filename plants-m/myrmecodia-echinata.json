    "intro": "Myrmecodia echinata, commonly known as the ant-plant, is a unique tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its swollen, tree-like stems that form a dense, hollow structure known as a \"cushion.\" The plant has small, pale green leaves and produces tiny, white or yellowish flowers. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it can derive some nutrients from its host through specialized structures called haustoria. Myrmecodia echinata also provides shelter for ants, which in turn help protect the plant from herbivores."
