    "intro": "Mammillaria heyderi subsp. meiacantha, commonly known as the Meiacantha mammillaria, is a compact cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular stem covered in dense, white to pale yellow tubercles, which are often adorned with spines. The plant produces showy, pink to reddish flowers during the spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
