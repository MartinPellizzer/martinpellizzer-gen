    "intro": "Mimosa pinetorum, commonly known as the Florida mimosa, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by the plant's sensitivity to physical contact. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and pine flatwoods. Mimosa pinetorum is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
