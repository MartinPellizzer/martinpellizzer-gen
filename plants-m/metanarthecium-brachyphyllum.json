    "intro": "Metanarthecium brachyphyllum, commonly known as the short-stemmed clubmoss, is a small, primitive vascular plant belonging to the order Lephenophyta. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and the presence of microphylls, which are small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of its stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ancient lineage, it provides valuable insights into the evolution of early land plants."
