    "intro": "Malvastrum coccineum var. elatum, commonly known as the showy malva, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, branching stems and showy, rose-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces fluffy, pinkish-white seed heads that are a striking feature in the late season. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its botanical structure includes palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and it is part of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton."
