    "intro": "Melaleuca urceolaris var. virgata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled pattern of green and white beneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers in clusters, typically during the spring and summer seasons. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a leathery texture and a distinctive blue-green color. This species is often found in coastal and sandy soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
