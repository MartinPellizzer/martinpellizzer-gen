    "intro": "Meriania excelsa, commonly known as the giant meriania, is a striking tropical tree native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often with a reddish tint at the base. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems. Meriania excelsa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
