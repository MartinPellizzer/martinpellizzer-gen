    "intro": "Mammillaria slevinii, commonly known as the Slevin's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its globular shape and dense covering of white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are followed by small, red fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid climates. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
