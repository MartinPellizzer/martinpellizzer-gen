It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in its natural habitat. Its leaves are typically elongated and grass-like, arranged in a rosette pattern. The flowers bloom in late spring or early summer, often in shades of white, pink, and purple."
