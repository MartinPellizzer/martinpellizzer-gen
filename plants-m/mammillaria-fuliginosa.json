    "intro": "Mammillaria fuliginosa, commonly known as the sooty mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, spherical shape and a dense covering of fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
