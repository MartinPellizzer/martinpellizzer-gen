It is native to eastern North America and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features heart-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by orange-red berries. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical uses in traditional medicine."
