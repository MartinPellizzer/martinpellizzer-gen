    "intro": "Maripa scandens var. cordata, commonly known as the heart-leaf maripa, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its rapid growth and climbing habit, it is often used in landscape design to cover trellises or walls."
