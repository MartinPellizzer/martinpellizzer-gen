    "intro": "Melastoma stellulatum, commonly known as the star-moss or star-flower, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in clusters. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its stems are often prostrate or ascending. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats."
