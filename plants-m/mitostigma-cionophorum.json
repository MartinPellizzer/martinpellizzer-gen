    "intro": "Mitostigma cionophorum, commonly known as the mountain cion, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit with small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. Its botanical features make it an important subject for studies on alpine flora adaptation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes."
