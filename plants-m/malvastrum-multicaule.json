    "intro": "Malvastrum multicaule, commonly known as the clustered mallows, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and its fibrous roots make it adaptable to various soil types. It thrives in full sun and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Malvastrum multicaule is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
