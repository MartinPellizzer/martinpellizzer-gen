It is characterized by its dense, overlapping fronds that form a lush, carpet-like appearance. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly and fill in spaces in shaded environments. Its leaves are dark green and have a waxy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in humid, low-light conditions, making it a popular choice for indoor and aquatic gardening."
