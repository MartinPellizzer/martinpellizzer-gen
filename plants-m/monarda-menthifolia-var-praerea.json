    "intro": "Monarda menthifolia var. praerea, commonly known as prairie bluemink, is a herbaceous perennial native to the central United States. It features aromatic, gray-green foliage and produces showy, tubular blue to violet flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats like prairies and woodland edges. It is part of the mint family (Lamiaceae), which is characterized by square stems and fragrant leaves. This variety is distinguished by its smaller, more compact growth compared to other Monarda species."
