    "intro": "Melicope obtusa, commonly known as the bluntleaf sandarac, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded forest habitats. The plant has simple, opposite, elliptic leaves that are often gland-dotted and have a rough texture. Its small, fragrant flowers are usually white or pale yellow and are clustered in inflorescences. The fruit is a small, woody drupe that contains a single seed, and the plant is valued for its aromatic resin, which has been used in traditional medicine."
