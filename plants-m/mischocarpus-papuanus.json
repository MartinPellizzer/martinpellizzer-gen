    "intro": "Mischocarpus papuanus, commonly known as the Papuan nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Pacific Islands, particularly Papua New Guinea. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and large, leathery leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by round, fleshy fruits resembling small oranges. The fruit contains a single large seed enclosed in a sweet, sticky pulp, which is often consumed by local communities. This species is valued not only for its edible fruits but also for its ecological and cultural significance in its native habitats."
