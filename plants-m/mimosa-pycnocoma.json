    "intro": "Mimosa pycnocoma, commonly known as the dense mimosa or the Mexican mimosa, is a shrub native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its feathery, fern-like leaves that are sensitive to touch, folding shut when disturbed. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom in spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its botanical features make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable in arid landscapes."
