    "intro": "Mormodes convoluta, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
