It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories, where it relies on specific soil conditions for survival. Its botanical features include opposite leaves and a unique floral structure that attracts specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
