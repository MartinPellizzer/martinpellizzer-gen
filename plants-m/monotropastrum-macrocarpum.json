    "intro": "Monotropastrum macrocarpum, commonly known as the large-fruited mistletoe, is a parasitic plant belonging to the family Viscaraceae. It primarily grows on the branches of hardwood trees such as oaks and hawthorns, relying on its host for nutrients and water. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are usually unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its berries are typically orange or red, containing sticky seeds that adhere to birds and facilitate dispersal. The plant's leaves are evergreen, and it plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for various insects and birds."
