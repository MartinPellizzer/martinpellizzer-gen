    "intro": "Mesanthemum radicans, commonly known as the creeping mesanthemum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its trailing stems and fleshy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its drought tolerance, it is well-suited for arid and semi-arid climates."
