    "intro": "Microlepia biserrata, commonly known as the serrated water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically 10\u201330 cm in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with small, serrated pinnae that give the plant its common name. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. The plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
