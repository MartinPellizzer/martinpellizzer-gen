    "intro": "Myrica brabantica, commonly known as the Brabant waxmyrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the wetlands of the Netherlands. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, waxy leaves that provide a glossy appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in coastal areas or near freshwater habitats. Myrica brabantica is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
