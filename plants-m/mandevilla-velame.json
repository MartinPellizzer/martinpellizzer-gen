    "intro": "Mandevilla velame, commonly known as the velvet mandevilla, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its trailing stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant produces velvety, dark green leaves that are glossy and often have a slight waxy texture. It thrives in warm, sunny environments and is often used in hanging baskets or as a climbing plant. Mandevilla velame is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
