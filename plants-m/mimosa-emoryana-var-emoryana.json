    "intro": "Mimosa emoryana var. emoryana, commonly known as the Emory mimosa, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response known as thigmonastic movement. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and disturbed areas. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
