    "intro": "Microlepia strigosa var. mauiensis, commonly known as the Maui sword fern, is a rare and endemic fern species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that are typically less than a meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories on the islands of Maui and Moloka\u02bbi. Its leaves are dark green and glossy, with a distinctive, finely textured appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, facing threats from habitat loss and invasive species."
