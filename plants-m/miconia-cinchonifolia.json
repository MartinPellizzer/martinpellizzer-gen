    "intro": "Miconia cinchonifolia, commonly known as the red miconia, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its fruit is a bright red, fleshy drupe that contains several seeds. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, it is considered an invasive species in some areas outside its native range."
