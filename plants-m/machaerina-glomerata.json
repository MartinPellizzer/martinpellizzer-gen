    "intro": "Machaerina glomerata, commonly known as the coastal flax, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are often pale green or brown in color. It thrives in coastal environments and is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils. Machaerina glomerata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize shorelines and provide habitat for native wildlife."
