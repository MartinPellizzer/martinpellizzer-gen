    "intro": "Magnistipula butayei subsp. glabriuscula, commonly known as the glabrous magnistipula, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, glabrous (hairless) leaves and compact growth habit. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist forest understory environments, where it relies on specific soil conditions for survival. Its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, often clustered in inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental changes."
