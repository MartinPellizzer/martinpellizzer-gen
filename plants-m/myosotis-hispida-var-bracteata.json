    "intro": "Myosotis hispida var. bracteata, commonly known as the bracteate forget-me-not, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, sky-blue to violet flowers with five petals. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, short hairs, giving the plant a slightly rough texture. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant's ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation in temperate climates."
