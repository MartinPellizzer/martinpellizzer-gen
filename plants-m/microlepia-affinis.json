    "intro": "Microlepia affinis, commonly known as the common microlepia, is a fern native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and India. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its leaves, which are covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices, and is often found growing on tree trunks or in dense undergrowth. Microlepia affinis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its graceful appearance."
