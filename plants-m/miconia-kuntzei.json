    "intro": "Miconia kuntzei, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that are typically followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia kuntzei is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, which can make it an invasive species in certain regions. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially problematic in non-native habitats."
