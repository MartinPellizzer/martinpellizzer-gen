    "intro": "Mogiphanes philoxeroides, commonly known as the false water hyacinth, is a floating aquatic plant native to southern Africa. It has dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer, helping it to remain buoyant. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It spreads rapidly through vegetative propagation, forming dense mats on the water surface. Due to its aggressive growth, it can outcompete native species and disrupt aquatic ecosystems."
