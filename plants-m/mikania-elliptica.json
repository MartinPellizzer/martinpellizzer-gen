    "intro": "Mikania elliptica, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a vigorous climbing vine native to the Americas. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, five-petaled flowers that are typically white or pale blue, blooming in the early morning. Its rapid growth habit makes it an invasive species in many regions outside its native range. The fibrous stems and leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
