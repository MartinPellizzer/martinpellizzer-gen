    "intro": "Morus alba var. chartacea, commonly known as the paper mulberry, is a variant of the white mulberry tree native to Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are thin and papery, giving it its common name. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall. Its leaves are often used in traditional papermaking due to their fibrous structure. The plant also produces small, pale yellow flowers and edible berries, though the latter are not typically consumed by humans."
