    "intro": "Myristica uviformis, commonly known as the \"wild nutmeg tree,\" is a tropical evergreen belonging to the Myristicaceae family. It is native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its large, glossy leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that lead to the development of its edible seeds. The seeds, known as mace, are encased in a red, fleshy aril and are used in traditional medicine and culinary applications. Its botanical features make it a valuable species in both ecological and economic contexts."
