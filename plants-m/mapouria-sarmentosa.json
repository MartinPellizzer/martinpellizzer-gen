    "intro": "Mapouria sarmentosa, commonly known as the creeping mapouria, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elliptical, woody fruits. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a rough texture. Mapouria sarmentosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
