It is characterized by its large, elongated leaves and clusters of small, elongated fruits that are typically consumed raw or cooked. The plant thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. It is primarily cultivated for its edible fruit, which has a mild, sweet flavor. Due to its genetic diversity, it is also used in the breeding of modern banana cultivars."
