    "intro": "Marina maritima, commonly known as sea holly, is a hardy perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flower heads surrounded by silver-gray bracts that resemble petals. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in sandy or rocky coastal environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in salty, windy conditions. Marina maritima is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to withstand harsh maritime climates."
