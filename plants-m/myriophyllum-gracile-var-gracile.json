It has slender, branching stems with small, opposite leaves that are usually less than 1 cm in length. The plant produces tiny, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in freshwater lakes and ponds with moderate to slow water flow. Its rapid growth can lead to dense vegetation, impacting water quality and aquatic habitats."
