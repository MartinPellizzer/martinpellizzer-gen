It is characterized by its aromatic, serrated leaves and clusters of small, pale purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as meadows and woodlands. It has a spreading growth habit, often forming dense mats due to its stolons. Its essential oils contain menthol and other compounds, making it valuable in both culinary and medicinal applications."
