    "intro": "Mentzelia cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf blazingstar, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and open grasslands. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. The showy yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
