    "intro": "Moquilea bracteosa, commonly known as the Mexican bract fern, is a tropical plant native to Central America and parts of the Caribbean. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often used in floral arrangements due to their aesthetic appeal. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-draining soil. Its reproductive structures include spore-bearing cones, which are typical of ferns. Moquilea bracteosa is valued both for its ornamental qualities and its role in local ecosystems."
