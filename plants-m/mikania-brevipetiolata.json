It is a climbing vine with heart-shaped, hairy leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. It is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors and along stream banks. The seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution in the wild."
