    "intro": "Myosotis sylvatica subsp. albomarginata, commonly known as the white-margin bluebell, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale blue to white. The subspecies is distinguished by its white-edged petals, which set it apart from the typical bluebell. It thrives in woodland and shady areas, preferring moist, well-drained soil. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is a symbol of spring in many regions."
