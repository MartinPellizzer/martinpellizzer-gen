    "intro": "Mkilua, commonly known as the African violet, is a popular ornamental plant native to East Africa. It belongs to the genus Saintpaulia and is characterized by its velvety, heart-shaped leaves and vibrant, showy flowers. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its compact growth habit makes it ideal for indoor cultivation, and it is often propagated through leaf cuttings or division. Mkilua is valued for its ability to bloom continuously throughout the year under proper care."
