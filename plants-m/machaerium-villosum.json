    "intro": "Machaerium villosum, commonly known as the silky machaerium, is a tropical shrub native to parts of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. The plant produces panicles of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom during the wet season. Its seeds are enclosed in small, leathery pods that split open when mature. Machaerium villosum is often found in moist, open habitats such as grasslands and forest edges."
