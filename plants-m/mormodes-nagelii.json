    "intro": "Mormodes nagelii, commonly known as the Nagel's orchid, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and glossy, often with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture. The flowers, which bloom in clusters, come in shades of white and pink, making it a visually striking addition to botanical gardens."
