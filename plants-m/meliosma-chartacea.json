It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a distinctive, velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its growth habit is typically low and spreading, with stems that often root at the nodes. The leaves and stems are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported soothing properties."
