    "intro": "Monanthotaxis tripetala, commonly known as the three-lobed fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant has a short, rhizomatous stem and produces small, clustered spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with three lobes that give it its common name. Monanthotaxis tripetala is often found in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appearance."
