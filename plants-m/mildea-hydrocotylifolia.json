    "intro": "Mildea hydrocotylifolia, commonly known as the water shield, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to wetlands and shallow water bodies. It features heart-shaped, floating leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface to repel water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often floating on the water's surface. Its root system helps stabilize sediment and improve water quality by filtering impurities. Mildea hydrocotylifolia plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
