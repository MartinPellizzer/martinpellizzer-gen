    "intro": "Maesobotrya dissitiflora, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and typically grows on the branches of host trees such as Ficus species. The plant has small, opposite leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the health of its host tree if left unchecked."
