    "intro": "Myrica laureola, commonly known as the wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and whitish underneath, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by berries that range in color from red to black. Myrica laureola thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. It is also valued for its aromatic foliage and is used in traditional medicine and as a source of aromatic oils."
