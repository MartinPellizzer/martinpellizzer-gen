    "intro": "Miconia herpetica, commonly known as the scarlet miconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces striking clusters of bright red flowers, which are often accompanied by showy bracts. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming an invasive species."
