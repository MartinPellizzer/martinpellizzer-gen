    "intro": "Mentha laevigata, commonly known as woolly mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and square, upright stems. The plant produces small, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. Mentha laevigata thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb, though it is less commonly cultivated than other mint species."
