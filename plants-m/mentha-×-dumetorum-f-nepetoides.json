It is a low-growing perennial herb with square stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile addition to gardens. Due to its aromatic foliage and ornamental value, it is often cultivated for both its aesthetic appeal and its mild mint-like scent."
