    "intro": "Melodorum verrucosum, commonly known as the rough-leaved wood sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Asia and the Americas. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive warty texture on the underside, which gives it its scientific name. The plant produces small, delicate white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its foliage is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
