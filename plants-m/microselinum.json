    "intro": "Microselinum, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread easily. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Microselinum is known for its medicinal properties and has been used historically in herbal remedies."
