    "intro": "Minuartia groenlandica subsp. glabra, commonly known as the Greenland sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It has small, usually white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is characterized by its glabrous (smooth) stems and leaves, which are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. This subspecies is often found in tundra and rocky habitats across northern Europe and North America."
