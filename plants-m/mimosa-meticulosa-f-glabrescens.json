    "intro": "Mimosa meticulosa f. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth mimosa, is a variant of the mimosa plant characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and leaves. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is native to regions of South America. The plant features bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, though this form is less hairy than the typical species. It produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, contributing to its ornamental value. This form is often cultivated for its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
