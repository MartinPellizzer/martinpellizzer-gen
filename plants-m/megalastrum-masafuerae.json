The plant is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its fruits are spherical and contain a single seed, which is dispersed by birds. Due to habitat loss, Megalastrum masafuerae is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
