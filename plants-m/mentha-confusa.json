It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a strong, menthol-like scent. Its small, tubular flowers are usually purple or pink, arranged in whorled clusters at the ends of the branches.
