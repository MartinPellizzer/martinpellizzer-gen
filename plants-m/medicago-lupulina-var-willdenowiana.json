    "intro": "Medicago lupulina var. willdenowiana, commonly known as the willdenow's sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, racemose inflorescences, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. The species is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to fix nitrogen and prevent soil erosion."
