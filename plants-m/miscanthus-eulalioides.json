    "intro": "Miscanthus eulalioides, commonly known as silver grass, is a perennial grass native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, silver-blue foliage and feathery plumes that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 feet and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. It is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its low maintenance requirements."
