    "intro": "Matteuccia struthiopteris f. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent shield fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive fronds and reproductive structures. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The fronds are bipinnate, with a shield-shaped base and elongated, pinnately compound upper segments. The sori, which contain the spores, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typically near the margins. This fern prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
