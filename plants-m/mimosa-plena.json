    "intro": "Mimosa plena, commonly known as the velvet mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves composed of numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Mimosa plena is also known for its sensitive leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait shared with its close relative, Mimosa pudica."
