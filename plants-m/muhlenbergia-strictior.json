    "intro": "Muhlenbergia strictior, commonly known as the silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and compact, upright growth habit. The plant produces fluffy, feathery seed heads in late summer, which add ornamental value to the landscape. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Muhlenbergia strictior is often used in native plant gardens and for erosion control due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
