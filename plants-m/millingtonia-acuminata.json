It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, grey bark and palmate leaves. The plant produces showy, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.
