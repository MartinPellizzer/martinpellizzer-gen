It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, often in alpine environments. Its flowers are tubular and bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
