    "intro": "Masdevallia senilis, commonly known as the silver orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble a cluster of tiny bells. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments with high light intensity but requires careful management of temperature and moisture levels. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its natural range."
