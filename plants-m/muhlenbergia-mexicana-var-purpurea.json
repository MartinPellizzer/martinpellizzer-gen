    "intro": "Muhlenbergia mexicana var. purpurea, commonly known as purple muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with purple or reddish hues, especially along the leaf margins. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, fluffy seeds, typical of the grass family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its striking coloration and drought tolerance."
