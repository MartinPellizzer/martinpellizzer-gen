    "intro": "Molinia arundinacea var. robusta, commonly known as tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and tall, cylindrical inflorescences that produce numerous small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to form extensive colonies, making it a dominant species in certain wetland ecosystems. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
