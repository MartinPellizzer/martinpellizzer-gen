    "intro": "Miconia cordigera, commonly known as the heartleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers followed by orange-red berries. It is often found in moist, shaded environments within tropical rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
