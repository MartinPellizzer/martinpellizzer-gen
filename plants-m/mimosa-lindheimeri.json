    "intro": "Mimosa lindheimeri, commonly known as the Lindheimer's mimosoid, is a shrub native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that are sensitive to touch, causing them to fold when disturbed. The plant produces small, yellow, globular flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Mimosa lindheimeri is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
