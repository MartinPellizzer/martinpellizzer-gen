It has slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically less than 1 millimeter wide, distinguishing it from its more robust relatives. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, which are often submerged or just below the water surface. It thrives in freshwater lakes and ponds with moderate to high light penetration and is often found in shallow, vegetated areas. This species is an important component of aquatic ecosystems, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
