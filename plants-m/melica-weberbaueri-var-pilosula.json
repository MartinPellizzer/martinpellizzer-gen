    "intro": "Melica weberbaueri var. pilosula, commonly known as the hairy meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
