    "intro": "Miconia norandina, commonly known as the Brazilian star apple, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves. The plant produces showy, white or pink flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are fleshy berries that turn red when mature and are edible. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
