It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and distinctive, hairy pods that contain edible seeds. The plant produces a significant amount of nitrogen through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia, making it valuable in soil enrichment. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded environments. Its flowers are typically pale yellow to green, and it is used both for its seeds and as a forage crop."
