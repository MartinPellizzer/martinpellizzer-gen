    "intro": "Miconia lucida, commonly known as the shining miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves that are often arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers with five petals, typically in shades of pink or white, which bloom during the wet season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous small, winged seeds. Miconia lucida is often found in lowland rainforests and is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets."
