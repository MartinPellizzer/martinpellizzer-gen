It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often white-veined and turn red in the fall. The tree produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically pink or red when mature. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its leaves, which are used in silkworm farming. The white mulberry also has ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes."
