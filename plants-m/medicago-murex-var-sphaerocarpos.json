It is characterized by its distinctive spherical seed pods, which set it apart from other varieties within the species. This plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has small, trifoliate leaves. While not widely cultivated, it is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological features."
