It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with a single, short stem and a few broad, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically blooming during the warmer months. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture from the air and surrounding environment. Maxillariella appendiculoides is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
