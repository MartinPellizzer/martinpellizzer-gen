    "intro": "Maxillaria pittieri, commonly known as the Pittier's orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant typically blooms during the summer months, and its inflorescence consists of several flowers arranged along a single stem. Maxillaria pittieri is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without being parasitic. Its unique floral structure and vibrant colors make it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
