    "intro": "Muhlenbergia hintonii, commonly known as Hinton's muhlenbergia, is a native grass species found primarily in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in open woodlands or along streambanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization and habitat for wildlife. Muhlenbergia hintonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
