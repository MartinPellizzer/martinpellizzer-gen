    "intro": "Mammillaria tolimensis var. subuncinata, commonly known as the Tolima mammillaria, is a compact cactus native to Colombia. It features a globular stem with white, woolly spines and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a slow growth rate and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a potted plant due to its compact size and ornamental appearance. This variety is prized for its unique morphology and is often cultivated for its aesthetic value."
