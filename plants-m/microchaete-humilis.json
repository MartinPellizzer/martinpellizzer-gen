    "intro": "Microchaete humilis, commonly known as the low hairgrass, is a small, herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems and produces tiny, spike-like inflorescences bearing small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its common name. Microchaete humilis is well adapted to arid conditions and can survive with minimal water."
