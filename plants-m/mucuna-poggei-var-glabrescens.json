It features heart-shaped leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which are more pronounced in this variety compared to other forms. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along forest edges. The seeds are encased in a hard pod and are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
