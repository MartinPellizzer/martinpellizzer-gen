    "intro": "Mastigostyla brevicaulis, commonly known as the short-stemmed clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, cylindrical stem and dense clusters of small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of its stem, which are typically reddish in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Due to its primitive structure, it provides valuable insights into the evolution of early vascular plants."
