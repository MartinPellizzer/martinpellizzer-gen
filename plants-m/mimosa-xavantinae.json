    "intro": "Mimosa xavantinae, commonly known as the Xavantina sensitive plant, is a species native to Brazil. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in light and touch. The plant belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and it has small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its unique sensitivity and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
