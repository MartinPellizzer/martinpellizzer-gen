    "intro": "Moquilea unguiculata, commonly known as the desert cactus or the red cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to 10 meters in height, often with a reddish or purplish hue. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Moquilea unguiculata is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with suitable climate conditions."
