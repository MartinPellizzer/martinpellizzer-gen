    "intro": "Mentha permanens, commonly known as the everlasting mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or violet in color. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a strong, minty scent, which is due to the presence of essential oils. Mentha permanens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of aromatic compounds."
