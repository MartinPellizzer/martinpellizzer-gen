    "intro": "Mickelopteris cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf fern, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are often heart-shaped. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Mickelopteris cordata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
