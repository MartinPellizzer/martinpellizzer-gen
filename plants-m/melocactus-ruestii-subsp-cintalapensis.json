It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, pale green stem and lack of ribs. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
