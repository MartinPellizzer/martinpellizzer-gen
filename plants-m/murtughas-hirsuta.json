It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a distinctive rough texture due to the dense pubescence.
