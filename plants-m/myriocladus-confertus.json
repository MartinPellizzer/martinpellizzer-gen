It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are arranged in clusters, providing it with a distinctive appearance. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water. Myriocladus confertus plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
