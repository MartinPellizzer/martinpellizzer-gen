    "intro": "Melhania abutiloides, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false abutilon, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, typically blooming during the warmer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its spread in suitable environments. Melhania abutiloides is often found in moist, shaded areas and can be invasive in certain regions."
