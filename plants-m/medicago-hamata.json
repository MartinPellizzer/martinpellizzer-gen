    "intro": "Medicago hamata, commonly known as the sand medic, is a perennial legume native to dry, sandy soils in the Mediterranean region. It features slender, erect stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. It is adapted to arid environments through its deep root system and ability to fix nitrogen. Medicago hamata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and soil-stabilizing properties."
