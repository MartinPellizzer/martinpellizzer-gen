    "intro": "Melocactus fortalezensis, commonly known as the Fortaleza melon cactus, is a species native to Brazil. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, green stem and the presence of spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil to thrive. Its slow growth rate makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
