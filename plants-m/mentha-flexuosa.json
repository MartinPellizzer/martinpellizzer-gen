    "intro": "Mentha flexuosa, commonly known as meadow mint, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in whorled clusters, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Mentha flexuosa is valued for its aromatic leaves and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported calming and digestive properties."
