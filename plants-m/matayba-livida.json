    "intro": "Matayba livida, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to South America. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds and small mammals, aiding in seed dispersal. It is often found in coastal areas and can thrive in a variety of soil types. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes classified as a noxious weed."
