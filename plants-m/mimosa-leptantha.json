    "intro": "Mimosa leptantha, commonly known as the woolly mimosa, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its soft, fuzzy leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its ornamental appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
