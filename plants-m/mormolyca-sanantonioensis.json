    "intro": "Mormolyca sanantonioensis, commonly known as the San Antonio mormolyca, is a rare flowering plant native to the limestone hills of central Texas. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the semi-arid climate of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas."
