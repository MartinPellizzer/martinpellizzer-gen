    "intro": "Maclura tinctoria subvar. sinuata, commonly known as the Chinese yellow wood or golden vine, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and large, palmately lobed leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange to red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine. Its wood is also prized for its yellowish color and durability, though it is not commonly used for commercial purposes today."
