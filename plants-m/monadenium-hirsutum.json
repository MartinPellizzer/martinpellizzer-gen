It is a succulent shrub characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems and leaves. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry climates."
