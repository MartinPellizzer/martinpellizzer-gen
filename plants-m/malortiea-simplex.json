    "intro": "Malortiea simplex, commonly known as the simple orchid, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. Malortiea simplex is characterized by its simple, unbranched inflorescence and is often found in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
