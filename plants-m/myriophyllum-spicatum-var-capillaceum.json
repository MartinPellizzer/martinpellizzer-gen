It has slender, branching stems that are often feather-like, with small, opposite leaves. The plant produces tiny, reddish flowers that are clustered in spiculate inflorescences, typically found near the water surface. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as lakes and ponds. Its rapid growth can lead to dense vegetation, impacting water quality and aquatic ecosystems."
