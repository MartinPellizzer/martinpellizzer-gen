    "intro": "Mentha longifolia f. pascua, commonly known as goatweed or pascua mint, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features aromatic, slightly hairy leaves that are lance-shaped and often have a minty scent. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers arranged in whorls along the stems, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its creeping growth habit allows it to form dense mats, making it suitable for ground cover in rocky or sandy soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal remedies."
