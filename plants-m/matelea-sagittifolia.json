It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes milkweeds and related plants. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped, arrowhead-like leaves and clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink.

Matelea sagittifolia is adapted to withstand drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
