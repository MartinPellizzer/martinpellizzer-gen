    "intro": "Mirabilis hirsuta var. linearis, commonly known as the velvetleaf four o'clock, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, velvety stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that open in the late afternoon and close at night, a trait typical of the Mirabilis genus. Its linear, lance-shaped leaves are arranged oppositely along the stem, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
