    "intro": "Mammillaria longiflora subsp. tepexicensis, commonly known as the Tepexi milk barrel cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a dense covering of white, woolly bristles that protect it from intense sunlight and moisture loss. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its stems are typically pale green to blue-gray, with distinct tubercles and areoles. This subspecies is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
