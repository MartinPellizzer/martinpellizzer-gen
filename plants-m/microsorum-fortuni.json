It features delicate, narrow leaves that are typically bright green with a slightly serrated edge. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in shaded, moist habitats. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize substrates efficiently. Microsorum fortuni is valued in aquascaping for its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide shelter for aquatic life."
