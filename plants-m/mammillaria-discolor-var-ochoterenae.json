    "intro": "Mammillaria discolor var. ochoterenae, commonly known as the Ochoterenae mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and pale green to blue-gray stems covered in white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted coloration. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated by succulent enthusiasts for its ornamental value."
