    "intro": "Mentha aquatica f. lloydii, commonly known as the water mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It features square, hairy stems and opposite leaves that are typically lance-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in clusters, which are usually pale blue or purple in color. It thrives in wet soils near streams, ponds, and marshes, making it a common sight in riparian zones. Mentha aquatica f. lloydii is often used in herbal remedies and as a culinary herb, though its strong minty scent can be overpowering."
