    "intro": "Miconia wolfei, commonly known as the woolly miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the Melastomataceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, woolly hairs. Its flowers are showy, with bright red petals and yellow stamens, making it a striking ornamental plant. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native flora."
