    "intro": "Melaleuca dendroidea, commonly known as the narrow-leaf paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia, where it typically grows in coastal and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that gives it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a waxy coating, and it produces small, fragrant white or yellow flowers. Melaleuca dendroidea is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in coastal environments."
