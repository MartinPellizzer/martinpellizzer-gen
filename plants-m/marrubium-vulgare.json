    "intro": "Marrubium vulgare, commonly known as horehound, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic plants such as mint and lavender. The plant features gray-green, hairy leaves and produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in its native habitats. Marrubium vulgare is often found in dry, rocky soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
