It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive silver-white margin. The plant produces small, pale purple flowers in whorled clusters, which appear in late summer. It is valued for its aromatic foliage, which contains high concentrations of menthol and other volatile oils. This variety is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and as a source of essential oils."
