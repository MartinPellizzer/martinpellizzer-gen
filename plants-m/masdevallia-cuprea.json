    "intro": "Masdevallia cuprea, commonly known as the coppery masdevallia, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking copper-colored petals and sepals, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows as a miniature orchid with a pseudobulb and is epiphytic, meaning it attaches itself to trees without being parasitic. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often appearing in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Masdevallia cuprea is appreciated for its unique coloration and is a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value."
