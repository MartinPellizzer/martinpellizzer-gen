    "intro": "Macrozamia pauli-guilielmi subsp. plurinervia, commonly known as the coastal cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by insects, and its seeds are enclosed in a thick, fibrous sarcocarp. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss. This subspecies plays an important ecological role in its native ecosystems, supporting a variety of fauna."
