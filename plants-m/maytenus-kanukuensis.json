    "intro": "Maytenus kanukuensis, commonly known as the Kanuku mayten, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Phyllantaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
