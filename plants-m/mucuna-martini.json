    "intro": "Mucuna martini, commonly known as the coffee bean plant, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of the Americas. It produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated, pod-like fruits containing numerous seeds. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and is often cultivated for its seed pods, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of caffeine. Its growth habit involves twining stems that ascend support structures, and it thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant's botanical significance lies in its role in nitrogen fixation and its historical use in herbal remedies."
