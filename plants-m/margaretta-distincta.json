    "intro": "Margaretta distincta, commonly known as the distinct margaret, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
