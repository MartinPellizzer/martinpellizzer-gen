    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 rotundifolia var. longispicata, commonly known as round-leaf mint with long bracts, is a hybrid species within the mint family (Lamiaceae). It is characterized by its round or oval-shaped leaves and elongated bracts that give it its specific epithet. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils that contribute to its distinct menthol-like fragrance. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of aromatic compounds."
