    "intro": "Mecodium ferax, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small bells. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Mecodium ferax is often found growing in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in low-nutrient, dry conditions."
