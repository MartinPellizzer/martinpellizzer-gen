    "intro": "Miltitzia pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf miltitzia, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It typically grows to a height of less than 1 meter, featuring dense, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or near streams. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
