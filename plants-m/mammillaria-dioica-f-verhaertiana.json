    "intro": "Mammillaria dioica f. verhaertiana, commonly known as the Verhaert's mammillaria, is a rare and distinctive cactus species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines and clusters of small, pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in arid environments. It is a dioecious species, meaning individual plants are either male or female, which influences its reproductive biology. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
