    "intro": "Miconia rufipila, commonly known as the red-stemmed miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a reddish underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. Miconia rufipila is often found in humid, lowland forests and is known for its rapid growth rate. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some regions, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
