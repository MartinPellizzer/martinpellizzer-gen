It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes cashew and mango trees. The plant is characterized by its distinctive spherical inflorescences, which bear small, clustered flowers. It typically grows in humid, shaded environments within the island's tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
