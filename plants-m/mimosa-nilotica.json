    "intro": "Mimosa nilotica, commonly known as the sensitive plant or velvetleaf, is a deciduous shrub native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun. Mimosa nilotica is often used in traditional medicine and has been introduced to other regions as an ornamental and for its potential ecological benefits."
