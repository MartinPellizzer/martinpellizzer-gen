    "intro": "Muscadinia rotundifolia var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf muscadine grape, is a compact variety of the muscadine grape native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, round leaves and clusters of small, dark purple to black berries. The plant is deciduous, shedding its leaves in the fall, and thrives in full sun with well-drained soil. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance. The berries, while not typically used for wine, are edible and can be used in jams or as a decorative element."
