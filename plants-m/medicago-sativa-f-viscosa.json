    "intro": "Medicago sativa f. viscosa, commonly known as sticky medic, is a variant of the common medick plant. It is characterized by its hairy, sticky leaves and stems, which give it its common name. This plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia and thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. It is an annual or biennial legume that produces small, yellow flowers and elongated pods. The sticky hairs on its foliage help in water retention and may deter herbivores."
