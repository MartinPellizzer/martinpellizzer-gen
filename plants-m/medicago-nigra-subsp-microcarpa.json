    "intro": "Medicago nigra subsp. microcarpa, commonly known as black medick, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its small, dark purple flowers and trifoliate leaves, typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant produces small, elliptical pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its ability to fix nitrogen, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
