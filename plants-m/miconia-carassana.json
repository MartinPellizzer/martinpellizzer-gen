    "intro": "Miconia carassana, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its fruit, which resembles a starfruit, is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor. Due to its rapid growth and invasive nature, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
