    "intro": "Metathelypteris singalanensis var. surbeckii, commonly known as the Surbeck's water fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce sporangia on the undersides of the fronds. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens or as a houseplant."
