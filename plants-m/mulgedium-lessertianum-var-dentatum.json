    "intro": "Mulgedium lessertianum var. dentatum, commonly known as the toothed mulgedium, is a rare and lesser-known plant species characterized by its distinctive serrated leaf margins. It is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
