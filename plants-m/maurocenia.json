It is characterized by its striking silver or gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The leaves are typically ovate or elliptical in shape and have a velvety texture. Maurocenia species are native to South America, particularly Brazil, and are often cultivated for their ornamental value. They thrive in well-drained soil and require bright, indirect light to flourish."
