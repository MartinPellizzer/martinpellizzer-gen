    "intro": "Matricaria arctica, commonly known as arctic chamomile, is a hardy perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions. It features small, daisy-like yellow flowers with white centers, typical of the Asteraceae family. The plant thrives in cold climates and is adapted to grow in well-drained, rocky soils. Its aromatic leaves and flowers contain compounds similar to those found in true chamomile. Matricaria arctica is often used in traditional medicine for its calming and anti-inflammatory properties."
