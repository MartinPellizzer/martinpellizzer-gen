    "intro": "Myrtus nummularia, commonly known as silver myrtle or snowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, rounded, silver-gray leaves that are densely packed, giving it a distinctive, mat-like appearance. The plant produces tiny, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, round, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Myrtus nummularia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators."
