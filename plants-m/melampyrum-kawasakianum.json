It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, yellowish-orange flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, often with a hairy texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
