    "intro": "Malcolmia chia var. hygrophila, commonly known as the water chia, is a flowering plant native to regions of southern Europe and northern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and small, pale yellow to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows or along streambanks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
