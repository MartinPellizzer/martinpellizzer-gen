    "intro": "Miltonia stenoglossa, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a tropical orchid native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its striking pink and white petals, with a distinctive lip that resembles a slipper. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree branches without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, producing a fragrant scent that attracts pollinators. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses due to its specific environmental requirements."
