It is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, and includes several species that are often cultivated for their ornamental value. The plants are characterized by their bell-shaped, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors, including blue, purple, and white. They typically grow as shrubs or subshrubs, with simple, opposite leaves and showy floral displays. Myosanthus species are often used in gardens for their aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in a range of soil conditions."
