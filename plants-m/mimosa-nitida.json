    "intro": "Mimosa nitida, commonly known as the silky mimosa, is a shrub native to South America. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, tactile appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in response to touch or movement. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique flowering behavior. Mimosa nitida is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun."
