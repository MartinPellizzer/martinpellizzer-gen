    "intro": "Microchloa setacea var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender hairgrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to various regions of Asia. It features fine, delicate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of short, hair-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, or along the edges of water bodies. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
