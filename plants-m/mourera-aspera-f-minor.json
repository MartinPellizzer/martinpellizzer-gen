    "intro": "Mourera aspera f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf Mourera, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features small, leathery leaves that are densely packed and often covered in fine hairs, giving it a textured appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
