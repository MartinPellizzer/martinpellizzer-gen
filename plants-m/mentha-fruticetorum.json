It is characterized by its upright, shrub-like growth habit and gray-green, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Mentha fruticetorum is often found growing in moist, shaded areas like woodlands and along stream banks. It is a member of the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is known for its aromatic, slightly minty scent."
