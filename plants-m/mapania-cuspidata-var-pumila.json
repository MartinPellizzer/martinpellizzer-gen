    "intro": "Mapania cuspidata var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf mapania, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. It is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and subtle floral display."
