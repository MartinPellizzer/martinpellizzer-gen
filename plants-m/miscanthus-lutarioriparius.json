    "intro": "Miscanthus lutarioriparius, commonly known as the marsh reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in marshes, fens, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to water-saturated soils. The plant produces tall, slender stalks with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often reddish or purple at the base. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, feather-like flowers that are wind-pollinated. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
