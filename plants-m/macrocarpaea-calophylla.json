    "intro": "Macrocarpaea calophylla, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are fleshy, berry-like structures that contain several seeds. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a problematic weed in agricultural and natural ecosystems."
