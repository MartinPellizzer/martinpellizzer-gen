    "intro": "Mimosa filicifolia, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by winged pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique sensitivity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
