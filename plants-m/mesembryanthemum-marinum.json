    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum marinum, commonly known as the sea mesembryanthemum, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and vibrant, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to tolerate salt spray and arid conditions. It is often found in dune environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand and preventing erosion. Mesembryanthemum marinum is a popular choice for coastal gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
