    "intro": "Maerua lanzae, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, hairy leaves adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soil conditions, making it well-suited for desert environments. Maerua lanzae plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for local wildlife."
