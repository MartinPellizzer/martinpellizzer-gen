    "intro": "Microseris anomala, commonly known as the narrowleaf mouse ear, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in arid to semi-arid environments. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in the spring, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. Microseris anomala is often found in open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and coastal dunes."
