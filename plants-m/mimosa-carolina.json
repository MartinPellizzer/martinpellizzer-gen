    "intro": "Mimosa carolina, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within its cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and helps it thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Mimosa carolina is often found in open woods, prairies, and along streambanks, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
