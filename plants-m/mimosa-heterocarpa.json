    "intro": "Mimosa heterocarpa, commonly known as the variable mimosa, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are composed of multiple pairs of small leaflets. The plant produces fluffy, yellow to orange spherical flower heads that bloom in late summer. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, inflated fruit that splits open when mature. Mimosa heterocarpa is often found in open, disturbed habitats and is adapted to thrive in dry conditions."
