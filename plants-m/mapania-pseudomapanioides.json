    "intro": "Mapania pseudomapanioides, commonly known as the false mapania, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, clustered inflorescences and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
