    "intro": "Millettia dura, commonly known as the hard millettia, is a species of legume native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves, which are typically odd-pinnate. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. Its seeds are encased in hard, pod-like fruits, which contribute to its common name. Millettia dura is often found in dry, disturbed habitats and is valued for its potential in soil stabilization and as a source of medicinal compounds."
