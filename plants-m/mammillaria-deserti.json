    "intro": "Mammillaria deserti, commonly known as the desert hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a ribbed structure and spiny areoles, which are characteristic features of the Mammillaria genus. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Mammillaria deserti is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
