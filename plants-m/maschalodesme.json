It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its milky sap, which is often toxic. The plants typically have opposite, ovate leaves and produce showy, clustered flowers in various colors, including yellow, orange, and red. They are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in a variety of habitats from forests to open grasslands. Maschalodesme species are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though their toxic properties require caution in handling."
