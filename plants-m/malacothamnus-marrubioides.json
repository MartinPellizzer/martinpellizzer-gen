    "intro": "Malacothamnus marrubioides, commonly known as the narrowleaf goldenbush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish to golden flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Malacothamnus marrubioides is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions with Mediterranean climates."
