    "intro": "Medicago falcata var. erectiuscula, commonly known as the erect sickle vetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, which are followed by elongated, curved pods. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. This variety is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration and as a forage plant."
