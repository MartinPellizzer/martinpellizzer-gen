    "intro": "Matricaria chamomilla var. suaveolens, commonly known as sweet chamomile, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features slender, hairy stems and produces daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow central disk. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, apple-like scent, which comes from compounds such as bisabolol and chamazulene. Its leaves are alternate, serrated, and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers bloom in late summer. This variety is often cultivated for its calming properties and use in herbal teas."
