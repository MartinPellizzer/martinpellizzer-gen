    "intro": "Meniscium triangulare, commonly known as the three-angled bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive triangular stems and clusters of bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are lanceolate and have a rough, hairy texture, while its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Meniscium triangulare is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
