    "intro": "Mucuna elliptica, commonly known as the velvet bean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and distinctive, hairy pods that contain numerous seeds. The plant produces a significant amount of nitrogen through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria in its root nodules. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it thrives in warm, humid climates. Mucuna elliptica is also valued for its seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of protein."
