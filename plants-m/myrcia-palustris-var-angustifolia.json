It is characterized by its narrow, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. Its fruits are small, woody capsules that release tiny seeds when mature. This species is often found in moist, acidic soils and is adapted to thrive in swampy or marshy environments."
