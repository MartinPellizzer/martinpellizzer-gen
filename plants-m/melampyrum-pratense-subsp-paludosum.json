    "intro": "Melampyrum pratense subsp. paludosum, commonly known as marsh touch-me-not, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in wet or moist habitats, such as marshes and fens, and is often found in nutrient-poor soils. Its parasitic nature allows it to derive nutrients from its host plants, making it an interesting subject in ecological studies."
