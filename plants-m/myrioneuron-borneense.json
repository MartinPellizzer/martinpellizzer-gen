It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and other valuable hardwoods. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. It typically grows as an evergreen tree or shrub, often reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native region."
