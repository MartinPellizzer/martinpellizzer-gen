    "intro": "Medinilla cardiophylla, commonly known as the heart-leaf medinilla, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are heart-shaped, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom throughout the year. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Medinilla cardiophylla is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and long-lasting blooms."
