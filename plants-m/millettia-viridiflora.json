    "intro": "Millettia viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered millettia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its pinnate leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and potential ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and reforestation projects."
