    "intro": "Malva plebeia, commonly known as the common mallow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves with a soft, fuzzy texture and its pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant grows up to 1 meter tall, with a sprawling habit that often forms a mat-like structure. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed habitats. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it an important plant in ecological gardens."
