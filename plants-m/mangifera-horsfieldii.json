    "intro": "Mangifera horsfieldii, commonly known as the Horsfield's mango, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, ovate leaves that are glossy and dark green on top with a lighter underside. The tree produces fragrant, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, sweet fruits with a fibrous pulp. Its fruit is similar in appearance to the common mango but has a distinct, more intense flavor. The plant is valued for both its ornamental beauty and its culinary uses in regional cuisines."
