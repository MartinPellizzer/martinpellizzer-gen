    "intro": "Mammillaria wegeneri, commonly known as the Wagner's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a small, spineless cactus with a globular shape and a distinctive white to pale green coloration. The plant features a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that help protect it from intense sunlight and water loss. It produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. This species is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil to thrive."
