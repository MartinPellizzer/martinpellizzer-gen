    "intro": "Microsorum phyllomanes, commonly known as the golden sword fern, is a species of water fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, narrow, and bright green fronds that often exhibit a golden hue on the underside. The plant thrives in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments, typically in swampy or marshy areas. Its rhizomes form dense mats, which help stabilize the surrounding soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. The fronds are often used in aquatic gardening and are popular in artificial ponds and water features."
