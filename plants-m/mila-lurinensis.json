    "intro": "Mila lurinensis, commonly known as the Lurin Mountain Mila, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid climates. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Mila lurinensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
