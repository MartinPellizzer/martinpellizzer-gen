    "intro": "Micropolypodium aphelolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf polypody, is a fern species native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in groups called sori. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
