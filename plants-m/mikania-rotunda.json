    "intro": "Mikania rotunda, commonly known as the globeflower, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom throughout the growing season. Its rapid growth habit makes it an effective ground cover but also a potential invasive species in some areas. Mikania rotunda is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
