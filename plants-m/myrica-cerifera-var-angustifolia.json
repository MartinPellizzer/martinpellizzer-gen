It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically glossy and dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant berries that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in swamps and along the edges of ponds. Its aromatic foliage and ability to tolerate waterlogged soil make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
