    "intro": "Marianthemum divergens, commonly known as the mountain avens, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of elongated, hairy leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool, moist conditions. It is a perennial species that produces a single, erect stem bearing the inflorescence. The flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate harsh environments."
