    "intro": "Melochia arenosa, commonly known as sand melon, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its rough, fissured bark and alternate, ovate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by distinctive, fleshy, orange-red fruits that are edible. It is adapted to drought conditions and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. Melochia arenosa is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food in its native habitats."
