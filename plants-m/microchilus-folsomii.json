    "intro": "Microchilus folsomii, commonly known as the Folsom's bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are short and whorled, with specialized bladders that aid in nutrient absorption. Microchilus folsomii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to the food web and maintaining water quality."
