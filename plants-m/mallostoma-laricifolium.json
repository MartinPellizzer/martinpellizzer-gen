It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy white to pale yellow ray flowers. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine regions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The species is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is an important component of mountain ecosystems."
