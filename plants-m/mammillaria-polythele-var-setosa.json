    "intro": "Mammillaria polythele var. setosa, commonly known as the woolly mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, white, woolly covering that covers the stems and flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. Its stems are short and cylindrical, often forming a compact, globular shape. It produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its fuzzy appearance."
