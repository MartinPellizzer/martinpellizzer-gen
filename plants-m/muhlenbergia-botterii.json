    "intro": "Muhlenbergia botterii, commonly known as the desert grass or sand dropseed, is a native grass species found in arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and slender, grass-like stems that form dense, low-growing clumps. The plant produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are often clustered at the tips of the stems. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in sandy or rocky soils. Muhlenbergia botterii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
