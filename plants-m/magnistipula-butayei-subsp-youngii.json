    "intro": "Magnistipula butayei subsp. youngii, commonly known as the Young's magnistipula, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique morphological features, including its lanceolate leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understoreys. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
