    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum humifusum, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing, succulent plant that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming during the cooler months. Its fleshy leaves are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The species is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
