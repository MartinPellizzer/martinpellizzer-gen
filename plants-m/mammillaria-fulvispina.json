It features a dense covering of white to yellow spines, which give it its common name. The plant has a compact growth habit with a short, thick stem and produces yellow flowers in the spring. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
