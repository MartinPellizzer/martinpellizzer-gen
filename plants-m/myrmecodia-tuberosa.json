    "intro": "Myrmecodia tuberosa, commonly known as the ant plant, is a unique epiphytic species native to Southeast Asia. It forms a symbiotic relationship with ants, providing them with shelter and food in exchange for protection and nutrients. The plant's structure consists of a swollen, tuberous stem covered in a dense network of leaf-like structures. Its leaves are small, waxy, and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps in water retention. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that attract pollinators like bees and wasps."
