    "intro": "Minaria harleyi, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in the early morning. Minaria harleyi is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that allow it to access underground water sources. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and resilient member of the Convolvulaceae family."
