    "intro": "Mammillaria saboae f. haudeana, commonly known as the Haudena's mammillaria, is a compact cactus with a globular shape and a dense covering of white to pale blue spines. It originates from the rocky soils of southern Mexico, where it thrives in well-draining conditions. The plant features small, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring. Its slow growth rate and compact form make it a popular choice for rock gardens and small container collections. It requires minimal water and full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
