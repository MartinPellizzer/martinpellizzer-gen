The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Melandrium nutans is an annual plant with a short growing season, completing its life cycle within a single year."
