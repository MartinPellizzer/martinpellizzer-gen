    "intro": "Mattiastrum nigrum, commonly known as black nightshade, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and the Americas. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades such as tomatoes and peppers. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are often mistaken for edible fruits, though they are toxic. Its leaves are lance-shaped and hairy, with a distinct, somewhat unpleasant odor. Mattiastrum nigrum is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain environments."
