    "intro": "Micranthes pallida var. yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan ghostflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as cabbages and mustards. The plant is characterized by its small, pale yellow flowers and finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a ghostly appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
