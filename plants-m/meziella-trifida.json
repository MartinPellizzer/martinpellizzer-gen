    "intro": "Meziella trifida, commonly known as the three-lobed meziella, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are divided into three distinct lobes. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate touch to its habitat. Meziella trifida is often found in dry, sunny environments and is adapted to withstand periods of drought. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
