    "intro": "Melaleuca smithii, commonly known as the Smith's melaleuca, is a small to medium-sized shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces woody capsules that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats. Melaleuca smithii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
