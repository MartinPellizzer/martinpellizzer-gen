    "intro": "Mespilus azarolus, commonly known as the Persian medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Caucasus and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its fragrant, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces edible berries that ripen in the autumn, turning from green to a deep purple or black color. These berries have a complex, sweet-and-sour flavor and are often used in jams and wines. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a distinctive serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens."
