    "intro": "Miconia vulcanicola, commonly known as the volcanic miconia, is a species of flowering plant native to the volcanic regions of Central America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain ecosystems."
