    "intro": "Maerua decumbens, commonly known as the African sandmat, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It has a sprawling, decumbent stem that lies close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant features small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered with fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss. Its flowers are pale yellow and occur in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Maerua decumbens is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
