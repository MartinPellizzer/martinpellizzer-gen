    "intro": "Mimosopsis moniliformis, commonly known as the bead tree, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, bead-like pods that form along the branches, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by the development of its unique, elongated seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. The bead tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual interest."
