It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem that is typically covered in white, woolly hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months. Its growth is slow, and it often forms dense clumps over time. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability to harsh environments, it is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and desert gardens."
