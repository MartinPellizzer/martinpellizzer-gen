    "intro": "Marsilea gracilenta, commonly known as water clover, is a small aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It has floating leaves that resemble clover, with four leaflets arranged in a cross shape. The plant thrives in shallow, still water and is often found in ponds and wetlands. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by insects. Its rapid growth makes it both a useful indicator species and a potential weed in aquatic environments."
