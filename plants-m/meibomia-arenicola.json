    "intro": "Meibomia arenicola, commonly known as the sand meibomia, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small shrub characterized by its compact growth habit and succulent leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its harsh environment. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in sandy soils and access moisture from deeper layers. Meibomia arenicola is well-suited to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall, making it a resilient species in challenging climates."
