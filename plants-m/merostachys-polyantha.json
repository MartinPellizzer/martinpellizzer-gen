It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems that often display a distinctive pink or red hue. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale green to yellowish florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense clumps, making it a popular ornamental grass in gardens.
