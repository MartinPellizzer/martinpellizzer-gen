    "intro": "Melica nutans var. picta, commonly known as the nodding melica, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces delicate, nodding inflorescences with spikelets that are typically greenish or reddish in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
