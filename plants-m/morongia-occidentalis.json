It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a short growing season. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
