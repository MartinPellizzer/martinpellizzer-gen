It is a succulent shrub characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are typically small, oval, and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Monadenium crenatum is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
