    "intro": "Mahonia schochii, commonly known as the golden Mahonia, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Mexico. It is characterized by its evergreen, holly-like leaves that are dark green and glossy on top with a lighter, sometimes whitish underside. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in loose, branched inflorescences. These flowers are followed by orange to red berries that contain several seeds. Mahonia schochii is well-suited for rock gardens and woodland settings due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
