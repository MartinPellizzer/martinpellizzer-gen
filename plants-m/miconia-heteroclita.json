    "intro": "Miconia heteroclita, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically borne on short pedicels. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Miconia heteroclita is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of tropical conditions."
