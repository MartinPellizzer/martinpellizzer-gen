    "intro": "Mollinedia macrophylla, commonly known as the giant marsh mallow, is a striking herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are thick and fleshy, adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils. Mollinedia macrophylla is often found in marshes and along the edges of rivers, where it plays an important role in stabilizing the ecosystem."
