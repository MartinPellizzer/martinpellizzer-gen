    "intro": "Malus sieversii var. kirghisorum, commonly known as the Kirghiz apple, is a wild apple species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, tart fruits and is considered a progenitor of many cultivated apple varieties. The plant typically grows in mountainous regions, where it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have serrated edges, while its flowers are white and clustered in inflorescences. This variety plays an important role in both ecological systems and the genetic diversity of domesticated apples."
