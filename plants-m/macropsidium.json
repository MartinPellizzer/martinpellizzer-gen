    "intro": "Macropsidium, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Malvaceae. These plants are characterized by their hairy stems and showy, often pink or purple flowers. They are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, where they have adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions. Macropsidium species often have specialized root systems that allow them to access water from deep underground. Their flowers attract various pollinators, including bees and butterflies, contributing to their ecological importance in their native habitats."
