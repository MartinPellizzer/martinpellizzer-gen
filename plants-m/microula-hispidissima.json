    "intro": "Microula hispidissima, commonly known as the hairy microula, is a flowering plant species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its small, densely hairy leaves and clusters of small, greenish flowers. The plant is typically shrub-like, with woody stems and adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. It produces small, round fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its resilience, it is often found in rocky soils and is of interest in ecological and botanical studies."
