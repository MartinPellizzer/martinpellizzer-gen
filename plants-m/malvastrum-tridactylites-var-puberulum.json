It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of pale pink to purple flowers with five petals, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
