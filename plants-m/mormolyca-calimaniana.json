It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas of montane forests, preferring cool and humid climates. Its leaves are broad and oval, with a smooth surface, and it produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. Due to habitat destruction, Mormolyca calimaniana is considered critically endangered and is under threat of extinction."
