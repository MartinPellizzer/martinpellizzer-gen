    "intro": "Mazus pulchellus var. wangii, commonly known as the Wang's pretty mazus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to China. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and delicate floral display."
