It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and a dense cluster of small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. It has a unique floral structure with two leaves per stem, giving it its specific epithet \"bifolia.\" Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
