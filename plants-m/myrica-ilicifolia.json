    "intro": "Myrica ilicifolia, commonly known as the wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its narrow, dark green leaves that are often covered with a waxy coating, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by dark blue, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. Myrica ilicifolia is also valued for its aromatic foliage and is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
