    "intro": "Melaleuca platycalyx, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels away in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly wavy margin. Melaleuca platycalyx is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it is often found in heathlands and open forests."
