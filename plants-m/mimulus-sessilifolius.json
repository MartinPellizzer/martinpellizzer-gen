    "intro": "Mimulus sessilifolius, commonly known as the sessile-leaved monkeyflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive yellow-orange flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. The leaves are sessile, meaning they lack a petiole and are directly attached to the stem, giving the plant a compact appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
