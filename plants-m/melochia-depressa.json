It is characterized by its trailing growth habit, with slender stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its leaves are typically ovate with a slightly hairy texture. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Melochia depressa is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage and ability to form dense mats."
