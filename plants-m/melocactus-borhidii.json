    "intro": "Melocactus borhidii, commonly known as the Borhidii melon cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, thick, and ribbed stem that typically grows close to the ground. The plant produces a single, large, spherical fruit that is often yellow or orange in color. Its spines are short and often covered in a fine, white coating. Melocactus borhidii is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its succulent stem for survival."
