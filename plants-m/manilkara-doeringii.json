    "intro": "Manilkara doeringii, commonly known as the Brazilian mahogany, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by round, greenish fruits that mature to a reddish hue. Its wood is highly valued for its dense, durable texture and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in the furniture and construction industries. However, due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species in many regions."
