    "intro": "Mikania serrulata, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a vigorous climbing vine native to the Americas. It features heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to spread over other vegetation, making it an aggressive weed in many regions. Its stems are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, sunny environments. Mikania serrulata is also known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies."
