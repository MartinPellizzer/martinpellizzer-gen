    "intro": "Mimosa chrysothrix, commonly known as the golden mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by light or physical stimuli. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for gardens in temperate climates. Due to its sensitivity to touch, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant for its unique behavior and aesthetic appeal."
