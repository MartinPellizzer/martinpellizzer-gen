    "intro": "Mariscus compactus var. macrostachys, commonly known as the giant marsh mallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe. It features stout, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often with a reddish-purple hue. The plant produces large, showy pink or purple flowers in clustered inflorescences, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, pond margins, and along streams."
