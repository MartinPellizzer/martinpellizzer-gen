    "intro": "Mikania cuspidata, commonly known as the slenderleaf morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it can become a nuisance in certain ecosystems."
