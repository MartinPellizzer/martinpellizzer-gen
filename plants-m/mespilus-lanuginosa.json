    "intro": "Mespilus lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly mulberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish bark and trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by edible, black, fleshy berries. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland or hedgerow habitats. The berries are a food source for various birds and mammals, contributing to its ecological significance."
