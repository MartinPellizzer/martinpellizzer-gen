    "intro": "Microrphium elmerianum, commonly known as the Elmer's water milfoil, is a small aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has finely divided, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters, and it reproduces both sexually and asexually through vegetative propagation. Due to its ability to spread rapidly, it can become invasive in certain water bodies if not managed properly."
