    "intro": "Medicago cupianiana, commonly known as the Persian clover, is a flowering plant native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is a low-growing annual herb with trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for dryland agriculture. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Its seeds are often used as forage for livestock and in soil restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
