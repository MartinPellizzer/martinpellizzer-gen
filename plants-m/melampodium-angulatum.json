    "intro": "Melampodium angulatum, commonly known as the angular everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and showy petals. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it a common sight in prairie and woodland habitats. Its small, yellow-orange flowers are followed by fluffy, seed-producing structures that aid in wind pollination. Melampodium angulatum is also valued for its drought tolerance and use in ornamental gardening."
