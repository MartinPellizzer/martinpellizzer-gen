    "intro": "Myriaspora surinamensis, commonly known as the Surinam sponge coral, is a unique marine organism that belongs to the class Anthozoa. It is characterized by its soft, branching structure and is typically found in shallow tropical waters. The plant exhibits a symbiotic relationship with zooxanthellae, which provide it with essential nutrients through photosynthesis. Its delicate, sponge-like appearance makes it a distinctive feature in coral reef ecosystems. However, it is not a true plant but a type of coral, and its botanical classification is often debated among marine biologists."
