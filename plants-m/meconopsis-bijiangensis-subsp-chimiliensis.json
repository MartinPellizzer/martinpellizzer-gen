    "intro": "Meconopsis bijiangensis subsp. chimiliensis, commonly known as the Chimili meconopsis, is a rare and striking alpine plant native to the high-altitude regions of Yunnan, China. It is characterized by its vibrant blue or purple bell-shaped flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cold, harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique floral morphology."
