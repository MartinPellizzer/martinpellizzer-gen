    "intro": "Mimosa albida var. albida, commonly known as the white mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and showy, fluffy yellow flower clusters. The plant produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across various habitats. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in grasslands and open woodlands. The plant is also known for its sensitive leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait shared with other mimosa species."
