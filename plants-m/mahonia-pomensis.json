    "intro": "Mahonia pomensis, commonly known as the Pomona Mahonia, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with dark green, leathery leaves that have a distinctive spiny margin. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are followed by blue-black berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Mahonia pomensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide year-round interest in the landscape."
