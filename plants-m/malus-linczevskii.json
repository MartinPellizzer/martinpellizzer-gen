    "intro": "Malus linczevskii, commonly known as the Linczevskii apple, is a rare species of crabapple native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, ornamental flowers and deciduous leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates with cold winters. Its fruit, while not widely cultivated for consumption, is sometimes used in local traditional medicine. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Malus linczevskii is considered a rare and endangered species."
