    "intro": "Myoxanthus gorgon, commonly known as the gorgon lichen, is a unique symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock surfaces. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, which is a composite body formed by the mutualistic relationship between the fungal and algal components. The alga provides photosynthetic capability, while the fungus offers structural support and protection. This adaptation allows Myoxanthus gorgon to colonize nutrient-poor substrates and contribute to ecological processes like soil stabilization and nutrient cycling."
