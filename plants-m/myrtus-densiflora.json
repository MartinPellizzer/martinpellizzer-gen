    "intro": "Myrtus densiflora, commonly known as dense-flowered myrtle, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, aromatic leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. These flowers are followed by small, dark blue berries that are edible but often used in culinary and medicinal applications. Myrtus densiflora is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and woodland habitats."
