    "intro": "Maytenus andongensis, commonly known as the Andong mayten, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Phyllanthaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland to montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
