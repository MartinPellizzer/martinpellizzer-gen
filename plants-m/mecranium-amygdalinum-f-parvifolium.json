    "intro": "Mecranium amygdalinum f. parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaved almond mecranium, is a unique variant of the mecranium genus. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lanceolate leaves that are typically a vibrant green. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, which bloom in early spring. Its fruit is a small, fleshy drupe containing a single seed, similar to other members of the Prunoideae subfamily. This cultivar is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and mild almond scent."
