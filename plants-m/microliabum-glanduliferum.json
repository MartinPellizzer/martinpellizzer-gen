    "intro": "Microliabum glanduliferum, commonly known as the glandular microliabum, is a flowering plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its small, herbaceous growth habit and trifoliate leaves with glandular surfaces. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale yellow to green in color. It is native to certain regions of South America and thrives in moist, temperate environments. Due to its unique glandular features, it is of interest in botanical studies related to plant chemistry and adaptation."
