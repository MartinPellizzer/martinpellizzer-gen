    "intro": "Macadamia, commonly known as the \"brazil nut tree,\" is a tropical evergreen tree native to Australia and parts of Southeast Asia. It produces unique, hard-shelled nuts that are rich in healthy fats, particularly monounsaturated fats. The plant's leaves are glossy and oval-shaped, with a dense canopy that provides shade. Macadamia trees can grow up to 20 meters tall and thrive in well-drained, acidic soils. The flowers are small and yellowish, and the tree is often cultivated for its nutritious and flavorful nuts."
