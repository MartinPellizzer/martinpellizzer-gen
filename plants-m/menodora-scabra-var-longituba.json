It belongs to the family Menodoridae and is characterized by its hairy, often glandular stems and leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are usually ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a rough texture due to the presence of stiff hairs. The species is noted for its unique morphological features and is of interest in botanical studies due to its specific habitat preferences."
