    "intro": "Microlepia communis, commonly known as the common microlepia, is a fern native to various parts of Asia, including India, China, and Southeast Asia. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a rhizomatous structure with narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into pinnae. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family. Microlepia communis is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
