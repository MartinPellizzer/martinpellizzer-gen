    "intro": "Mollia, commonly known as the common milkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apocynaceae family. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces a milky sap, which is a distinguishing feature and can be toxic to some animals. Mollia typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. It plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly butterflies."
