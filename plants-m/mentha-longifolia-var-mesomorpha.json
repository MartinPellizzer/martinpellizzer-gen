    "intro": "Mentha longifolia var. mesomorpha, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spearmint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and fragrant, pale purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, oval fruits called schizocarps, which contain two mericarps each. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. This variety is often used in culinary and aromatic applications due to its strong, minty scent."
