    "intro": "Miconia calcarata, commonly known as the candlewood tree, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can grow up to 30 inches in diameter. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a bright red, fleshy berry that contains numerous seeds. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
