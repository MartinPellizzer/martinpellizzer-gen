    "intro": "Medicago littoralis var. rugulosa, commonly known as the rugose medick, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its hairy, rugose leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. This perennial species is typically found in coastal and saline environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant has a low-growing habit and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and fix nitrogen. Its seeds are encased in a pod that splits open to release the mature seeds, aiding in its propagation."
