    "intro": "Memora fulgens var. elongata, commonly known as the elongated flame flower, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its vibrant, orange-red bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects, while its elongated stems allow it to grow in a cascading or upright form. It thrives in warm, humid climates with bright indirect light and well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
