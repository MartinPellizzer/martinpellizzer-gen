It features slender, trailing stems that can reach up to 1 meter in length, often forming dense mats. The leaves are lanceolate, with a pointed tip and a serrated margin, giving the plant a distinctive appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by cylindrical seed pods. This species is well adapted to moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories."
