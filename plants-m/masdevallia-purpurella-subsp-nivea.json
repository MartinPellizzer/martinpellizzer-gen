    "intro": "Masdevallia purpurella subsp. nivea, commonly known as the white-flowered masdevallia, is a rare and striking orchid native to the Andean highlands of South America. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and its elegant, white to pale pink flowers with intricate markings. The plant typically blooms during the cooler months, producing fragrant, spurred flowers that are highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts. Its foliage consists of dark green, strap-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. Due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging but rewarding plant for advanced growers."
