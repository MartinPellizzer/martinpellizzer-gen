    "intro": "Manglietia pubipetala, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces showy, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to reveal edible seeds surrounded by a fleshy, yellowish pulp. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
