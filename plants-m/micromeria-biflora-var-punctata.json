    "intro": "Micromeria biflora var. punctata, commonly known as the spotted desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its small size and drought tolerance make it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The varietal name \"punctata\" refers to the distinctive spotted or dotted appearance of its leaves."
