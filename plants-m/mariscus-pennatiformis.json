    "intro": "Mariscus pennatiformis, commonly known as the sea holly, is a marine flowering plant that thrives in shallow coastal waters. It is characterized by its distinctive, branched stems and clusters of blue or purple flowers. The plant has adapted to saline environments with specialized structures that help it retain moisture and resist desiccation. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, which minimize water loss. Mariscus pennatiformis plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms."
