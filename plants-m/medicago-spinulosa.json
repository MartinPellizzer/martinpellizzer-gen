    "intro": "Medicago spinulosa, commonly known as the prickly medick, is a low-growing perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a deep root system, enabling it to thrive in poor soils and arid conditions. It is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Medicago spinulosa is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
