It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically linear and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in harsh environments. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is known for its ability to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in high-altitude areas."
