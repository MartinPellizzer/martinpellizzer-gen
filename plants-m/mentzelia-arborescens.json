    "intro": "Mentzelia arborescens, commonly known as tree mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along canyons. The plant features a woody stem that branches near the base, giving it a shrub-like appearance. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are showy, with five pink to purple petals arranged in a funnel shape. Mentzelia arborescens is adapted to withstand drought and heat, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
