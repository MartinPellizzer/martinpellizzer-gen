    "intro": "Muscaria atropurpurea, commonly known as the purple-staining fly agaric, is a species of mushroom characterized by its distinctive cap and stem. The cap is typically pale yellow to orange with a purple or reddish tinge, while the stem is white with a bulbous base. It contains psychoactive compounds such as muscimol and ibotenic acid, which can cause hallucinogenic effects. The mushroom is native to various parts of Europe and Asia and is often found in forests and grasslands. Due to its potent effects, it is considered a hallucinogenic mushroom and is sometimes used in traditional or recreational contexts."
