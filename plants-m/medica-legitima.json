It is an upright herb with serrated leaves and small, greenish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant contains stinging hairs that can cause a painful reaction upon contact with the skin. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Medica legitima has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, including its high content of vitamins and minerals."
