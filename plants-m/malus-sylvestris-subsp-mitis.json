    "intro": "Malus sylvestris subsp. mitis, commonly known as the wild apple or crab apple, is a shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are oval to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, ornamental flowers in white or pink hues, which appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its fruits are small, sour apples that typically ripen in late summer or early autumn. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical significance in the cultivation of domesticated apple varieties."
