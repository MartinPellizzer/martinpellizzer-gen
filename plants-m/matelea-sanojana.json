    "intro": "Matelea sanojana, commonly known as the Mexican moonflower, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes milkweeds and other toxic plants. The plant is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night, emitting a strong, sweet fragrance to attract pollinators. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and opposite, while the stems are woody and often branching. The flowers close during the day, making it a unique example of nyctinasty behavior in the plant kingdom."
