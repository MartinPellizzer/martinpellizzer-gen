    "intro": "Mentha riparia var. acuta, commonly known as narrow-leaf water mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, streamside habitats in North America. It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairless and have a distinct minty aroma. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in wet soils and is often found along riverbanks and pond edges. This variety is closely related to other mint species and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
