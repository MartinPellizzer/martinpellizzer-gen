It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by spherical, yellowish fruits that contain sticky, milky latex. Its seeds are enclosed in a hard, woody capsule and are dispersed by animals. Melia bogoriensis is valued for its timber, which is used in construction and furniture making."
