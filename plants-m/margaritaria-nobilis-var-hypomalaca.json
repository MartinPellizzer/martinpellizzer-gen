    "intro": "Margaritaria nobilis var. hypomalaca, commonly known as the red-leafed hibiscus, is a tropical shrub native to Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, velvety red foliage, which contrasts beautifully with its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with a distinctive red throat, blooming throughout the warmer months. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value in both gardens and as a houseplant."
