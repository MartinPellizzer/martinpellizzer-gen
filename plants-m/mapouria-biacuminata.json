    "intro": "Mapouria biacuminata, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a deciduous shrub native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its thick, milky sap, which is toxic and used in traditional medicine. The plant features lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and unique floral structures, making it a popular choice for horticultural collections. However, due to its toxic properties, it requires careful handling and is not suitable for indoor cultivation without proper precautions."
