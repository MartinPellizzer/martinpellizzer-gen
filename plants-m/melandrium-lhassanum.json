    "intro": "Melandrium lhassanum, commonly known as the Tibetan catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing habit and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky and arid environments, adapting to the harsh climatic conditions of its habitat. Its leaves are fleshy and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Melandrium lhassanum plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of alpine regions."
