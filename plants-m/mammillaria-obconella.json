    "intro": "Mammillaria obconella, commonly known as the narrow-ribbed hedgehog cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a compact, rounded shape and a green to bluish-green stem. The plant features prominent, rib-like structures that are slightly curved inward, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, typically from the areoles along the stems. Mammillaria obconella is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
