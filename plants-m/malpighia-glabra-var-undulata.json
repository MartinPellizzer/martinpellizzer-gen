It produces large, showy flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by fruit that has a rough, spiny exterior. The fruit is characterized by its undulating, warty surface, which gives the variety its name. The leaves are ovate, glossy, and have a slightly serrated margin. This plant is valued for its edible fruit, which has a creamy, tropical flavor and is used in both culinary and medicinal applications."
