    "intro": "Mimosa pseudoschinus, commonly known as the Brazilian mimosa, is a shrub native to South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its sensitive foliage, it is often used as a specimen plant in cultivated landscapes."
