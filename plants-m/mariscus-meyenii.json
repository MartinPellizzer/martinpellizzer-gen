It is a member of the Polemoniaceae family and is characterized by its striking white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and thrives in areas with high altitudes and cool climates. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy powder.
