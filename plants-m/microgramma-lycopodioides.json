    "intro": "Microgramma lycopodioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf clubmoss, is a small evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, scale-like leaves that form dense, compact clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Microgramma lycopodioides reproduces via spores rather than seeds, a trait common among primitive vascular plants. Its structure includes a short, underground rhizome with upright, branching stems."
