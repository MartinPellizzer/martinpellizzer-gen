    "intro": "Mucuna atropurpurea, commonly known as purple urd, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and showy, violet-purple flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces elongated, flat pods containing lens-shaped seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Mucuna atropurpurea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in Ayurvedic practices for its purported health benefits."
