    "intro": "Megalochlamys strobilifera, commonly known as the giant clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte characterized by its distinctive, clustered growth habit and spore-bearing cones. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices, where it thrives in high humidity and partial shade. The plant features elongated, strap-like leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Its reproductive structures, called strobili, are cone-like and contain spores, which are released to propagate the species. Megalochlamys strobilifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in maintaining ecological balance in its native habitats."
