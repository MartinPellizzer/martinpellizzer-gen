    "intro": "Microstylis samoensis, commonly known as the Samoan microstylis, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the island of Savai'i in Samoa. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered near the base of the leaves. Microstylis samoensis thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
