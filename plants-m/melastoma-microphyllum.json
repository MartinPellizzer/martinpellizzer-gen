It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, and are typically pink or white in color. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal."
