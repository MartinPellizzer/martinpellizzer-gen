    "intro": "Macaranga uxoris, commonly known as the white-veined maple, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves with prominent white veins, which give it its common name. The plant belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed habitats. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically arranged in clusters, while its fruit is a three-winged samara that aids in wind dispersal. The species is often used in reforestation projects due to its hardiness and ecological benefits."
