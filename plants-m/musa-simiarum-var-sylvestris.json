    "intro": "Musa simiarum var. sylvestris, commonly known as the wild banana, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its large, broad leaves and clustered inflorescences. The plant produces small, green, finger-like fruits that are typically not edible due to high levels of toxins. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. This variety is often used in botanical studies for its genetic diversity and potential for hybridization with cultivated bananas."
