    "intro": "Muhlenbergia subalpina, commonly known as the alpine muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its flowering spikes are usually compact and bear small, spikelet-like flowers that are wind-pollinated. Muhlenbergia subalpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude environments."
