It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. This subspecies is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
