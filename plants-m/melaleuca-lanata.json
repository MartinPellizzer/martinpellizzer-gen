    "intro": "Melaleuca lanata, commonly known as the silky tea tree, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its greyish bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom during the summer months. Its nectar-rich flowers attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and birds. The plant is often found in coastal and sandy soils, and it is adapted to withstand drought and salt spray."
