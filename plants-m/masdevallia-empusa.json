    "intro": "Masdevallia empusa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its elongated, often pale or translucent petals that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant typically grows epiphytically on trees, relying on air, rain, and decaying matter for nutrients. Its flowers, which bloom in late winter or early spring, are usually a mix of white, green, and purple hues. Due to its habitat specificity and conservation status, it is considered endangered and is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts."
