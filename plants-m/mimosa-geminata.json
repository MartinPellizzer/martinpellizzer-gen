    "intro": "Mimosa geminata, commonly known as the twinleaf mimosa, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are divided into pairs of leaflets, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, pod-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Mimosa geminata is also known for its sensitive leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimuli."
