    "intro": "Marrubium supinum var. boissieri, commonly known as the Boissier's horehound, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features wiry, ascending or spreading stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and have a distinctive bitter taste due to the presence of mucilage. This variety is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is valued for its medicinal and ornamental properties."
