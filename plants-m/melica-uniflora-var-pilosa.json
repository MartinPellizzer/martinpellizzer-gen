    "intro": "Melica uniflora var. pilosa, commonly known as hairy false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and dense, hairy foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it ecologically valuable in riparian zones."
