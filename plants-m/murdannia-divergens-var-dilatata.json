    "intro": "Murdannia divergens var. dilatata, commonly known as the broadleaf marshweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It features a rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers arranged in a loose cluster, which bloom in early summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in saturated soils, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds. This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
