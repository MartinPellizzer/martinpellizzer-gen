    "intro": "Miconia elongata, commonly known as the longleaf miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melastomataceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens, though it can become invasive in certain areas."
