    "intro": "Methorium spicatum, commonly known as the spiky flamebush, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and clusters of bright red, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a hardy species adapted to dry conditions. Methorium spicatum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance."
