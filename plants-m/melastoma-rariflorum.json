    "intro": "Melastoma rariflorum, commonly known as the rare-flowered melastoma, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, with five petals and prominent stamens. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release minute seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Melastoma rariflorum is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as montane forests."
