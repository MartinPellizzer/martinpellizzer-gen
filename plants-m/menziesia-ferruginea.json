    "intro": "Menziesia ferruginea, commonly known as rusty menziesia, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Menziesia ferruginea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and insects."
