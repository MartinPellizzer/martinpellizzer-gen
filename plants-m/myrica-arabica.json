    "intro": "Myrica arabica, commonly known as the Arabian wax tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and small, wax-coated fruits that are yellow when mature. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and coastal areas. Its wax-rich fruits have been historically used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural wax. Myrica arabica plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
