It typically grows in moist, rocky habitats such as stream banks and canyon walls. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny flowers. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like appearance, which gives it its common name. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
