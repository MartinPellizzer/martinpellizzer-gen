    "intro": "Mariscopsis hyalinus, commonly known as the glassy marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to wetland habitats in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, showy white or pale green flower that blooms in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs or along the edges of ponds. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an important indicator species for wetland health. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered threatened and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
