    "intro": "Minuartia lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Minuartia lanceolata is often found in tundra and mountainous environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
