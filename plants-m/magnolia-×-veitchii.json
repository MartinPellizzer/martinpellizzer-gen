    "intro": "Magnolia \u00d7 veitchii, commonly known as the Veitch's magnolia, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It features showy, fragrant, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, appearing before the leaves in early spring. The plant has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a parent species in the development of many modern magnolia cultivars."
