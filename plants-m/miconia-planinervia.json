    "intro": "Miconia planinervia, commonly known as the broad-leaved miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia planinervia is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions. Its botanical features make it a notable plant in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
