    "intro": "Minuartia funkii, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, arranged in a rosette pattern to minimize water loss. Minuartia funkii is well adapted to harsh climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardy nature."
