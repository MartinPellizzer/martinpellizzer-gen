    "intro": "Mentha aquatica f. limosa, commonly known as water mint, is a variant of the water mint species that thrives in moist or aquatic environments. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves and flowering spikes that produce small, pale blue or purple flowers. This subspecies is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and other waterlogged habitats. Its leaves are typically longer and narrower than those of the standard water mint, and it has a more delicate appearance. The plant is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in herbal remedies for its cooling and digestive effects."
