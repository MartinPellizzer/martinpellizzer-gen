    "intro": "Microlepia hookeriana, commonly known as Hooker's microlepia, is a fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of roots, which help anchor it to the substrate. The spores are produced in small, clustered clusters on the undersides of the fronds."
