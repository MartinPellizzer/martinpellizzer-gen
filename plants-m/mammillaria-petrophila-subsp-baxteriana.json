    "intro": "Mammillaria petrophila subsp. baxteriana, commonly known as the Baxter's milk barrel cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its globular shape and dense covering of white to pale green tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are borne on short pedicels. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
