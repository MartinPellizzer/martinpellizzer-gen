    "intro": "Mentha longifolia subsp. pellita, commonly known as narrow-leaved mint, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, aromatic leaves that are typically narrower and longer than those of the common mint species. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers that appear in whorls along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This subspecies is often used in culinary and aromatic applications due to its distinctive menthol-like fragrance."
