    "intro": "Minuartia charadzeae, commonly known as the Georgian rock-cress, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Georgia. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other flowering plants with small, cross-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
