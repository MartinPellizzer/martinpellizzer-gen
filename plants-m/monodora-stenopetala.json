    "intro": "Monodora stenopetala, commonly known as African sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to East Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and long, cylindrical fruits that contain aromatic seeds. The plant belongs to the family Anacardiaceae and is known for its fragrant wood, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
