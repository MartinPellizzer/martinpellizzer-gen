    "intro": "Marginaria serpens, commonly known as the snake's head or snake's head plant, is a unique species belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, serpentine stems that resemble a snake's body, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in wet meadows. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in umbels, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Marginaria serpens is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance."
