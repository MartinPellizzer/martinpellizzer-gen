    "intro": "Morus alba var. integrifolia, commonly known as the white mulberry with entire leaves, is a variant of the white mulberry tree native to Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves that are entire, lacking the lobes or teeth found in other varieties. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as mulberries, which are typically white or pink in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its leaves, which are used in sericulture (silkworm farming). This variety is also valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types."
