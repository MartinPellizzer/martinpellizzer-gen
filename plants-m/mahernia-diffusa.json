    "intro": "Mahernia diffusa, commonly known as the spreading mahernia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with sprawling stems that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or purple in color, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are linear and covered in a fine layer of white hair, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Mahernia diffusa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
