    "intro": "Malacocarpus tabularis, commonly known as the flat-leaf cycad, is a species of cycad native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves that are arranged in a fan-like pattern. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soil and requires ample sunlight. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
