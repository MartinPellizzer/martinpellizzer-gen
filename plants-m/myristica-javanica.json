    "intro": "Myristica javanica, commonly known as the Java nut or mace tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, woody fruits and distinctive red, fleshy aril that encases the seed. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by oval-shaped fruits with a thick, woody outer layer. The seeds are enclosed in a red, fleshy covering called an aril, which is often used in traditional medicine and as a spice. Myristica javanica is also valued for its ornamental appearance and is cultivated for its aromatic properties."
