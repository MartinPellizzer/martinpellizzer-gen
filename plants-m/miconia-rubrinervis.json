    "intro": "Miconia rubrinervis, commonly known as the red-veined miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with prominent red veins, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. Miconia rubrinervis is often found in moist, shaded areas of tropical rainforests. It has been introduced to other regions and is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
