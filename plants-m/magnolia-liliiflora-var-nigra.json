    "intro": "Magnolia liliiflora var. nigra, commonly known as the black magnolia, is a variant of the lily magnolia native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dark purple to black flowers, which contrast strikingly with its glossy, dark green foliage. The plant produces showy, cup-shaped blooms in late spring, often with a subtle fragrance. Its leaves are broad and ovate, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its dramatic floral display."
