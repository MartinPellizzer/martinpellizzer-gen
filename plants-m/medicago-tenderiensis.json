    "intro": "Medicago tenderiensis, commonly known as the tender vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor environments. Medicago tenderiensis is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
