    "intro": "Marsilea hirsutissima, commonly known as the hairy water clover, is a floating aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, four-leaf clover-like leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its reproductive structures include small, yellowish flowers that develop into buoyant, spore-producing fruits. Marsilea hirsutissima is often used in water gardens and is also a subject of study in ecological and botanical research."
