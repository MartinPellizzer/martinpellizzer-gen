    "intro": "Mentha viridis var. lacerata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mint or creeping mint, is a variant of the green mint species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often serrated along the edges. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils that contribute to its minty fragrance and flavor. The plant is often used in herbal teas and as a culinary herb, though it is less common than other mint varieties."
