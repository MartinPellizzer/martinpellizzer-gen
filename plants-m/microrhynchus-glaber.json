It typically grows in moist, sandy soils in pine flatwoods and scrub habitats. The plant features a slender, unbranched stem that can reach up to 30 centimeters in height. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, pale green to white flowers with a distinctive, smooth, tongue-like lip. This orchid is characterized by its unique floral structure and is often found in shaded, humid environments."
