    "intro": "Malvastrum lasiocarpum, commonly known as the woolly mallow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fuzzy, gray-green foliage and showy, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces capsule fruits that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
