It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, commonly known as the ice plant family, and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, star-like inflorescences, which bloom during the summer months. Mimetes proteoides is a short-lived perennial, often growing to a height of only a few centimeters, and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its unique morphology and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
