    "intro": "Mopania chicle, commonly known as chewing gum tree, is a deciduous tree native to Central America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The tree produces small, round fruits that are encased in a thick, sticky pulp, which is the source of natural chewing gum. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in its native habitat."
