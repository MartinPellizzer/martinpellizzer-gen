    "intro": "Melandrium andicola var. nubigenum, commonly known as the Andean sandcatcher, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom during the short growing season. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its habitat. Its leaves are typically succulent, helping it conserve moisture in arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
