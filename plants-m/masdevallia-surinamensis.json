It is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate, often colorful flowers that resemble miniature orchid blooms. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often epiphytic on trees or rocks. Its leaves are usually dark green and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. The flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, adding a striking visual element to its environment."
