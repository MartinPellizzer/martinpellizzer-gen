    "intro": "Metrosideros australis, commonly known as the New Zealand Christmas tree, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright red or orange flowers, which are followed by distinctive, woody, cone-like fruits. It thrives in coastal and lowland areas, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also important in traditional M\u0101ori culture."
