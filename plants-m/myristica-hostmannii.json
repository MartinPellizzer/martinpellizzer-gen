It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is closely related to the nutmeg tree, Myristica fragrans. The plant produces aromatic seeds that are encased in a reddish, fleshy aril, which is often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and have a glossy surface, while its flowers are small and greenish-white in color. The tree is valued for its unique fragrance and has been historically used in both culinary and medicinal applications."
