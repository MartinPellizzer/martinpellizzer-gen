    "intro": "Mezcala, commonly known as the sacred mushroom, is a psychoactive fungus native to the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula in Mexico. It belongs to the genus *Psilocybe* and contains the hallucinogenic compounds psilocybin and psilocin. The plant is typically found growing in humid, shaded environments, often near decaying organic matter. Its spore-filled caps are used in traditional spiritual ceremonies by indigenous communities. Due to its psychoactive properties, mezcala is classified as a controlled substance in many countries."
