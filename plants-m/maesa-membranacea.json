    "intro": "Maesa membranacea, commonly known as the membranous maesa, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its evergreen shrub form with lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, typical of its natural habitat. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
