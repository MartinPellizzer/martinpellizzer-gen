    "intro": "Minuartia nuttallii, commonly known as the Nuttall's sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and rocky environments in North America. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a compact growth habit with succulent stems and leaves that help it conserve water in harsh conditions. It is often found in disturbed soils, gravelly slopes, and sandy areas, thriving in full sun. Minuartia nuttallii is an important component of xerophytic plant communities and is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor environments."
