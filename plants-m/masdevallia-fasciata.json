    "intro": "Masdevallia fasciata, commonly known as the zebra orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, striped flowers that resemble a zebra's coat, with contrasting dark and light bands on the petals and sepals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers are usually small to medium in size and come in a range of colors, including white, pink, and purple. Masdevallia fasciata is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
