    "intro": "Meniscium triphyllum f. cristatum, commonly known as the cristate trifoliate bellflower, is a unique variant of the trifoliate bellflower. It is characterized by its distinctive crinkled or crisped leaves, a feature known as cristation, which gives it an ornamental appearance. The plant is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands or stream banks. Its flowers are bell-shaped and usually blue or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. The botanical interest of this plant lies in its unusual morphology and its role as a rare, naturally occurring form within the Meniscium genus."
