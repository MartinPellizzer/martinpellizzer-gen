    "intro": "Maerua racemosa, commonly known as the African glorybower, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It features small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has a woody stem with dense, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its root system is deep and drought-resistant, allowing it to thrive in poor soil conditions. Maerua racemosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
