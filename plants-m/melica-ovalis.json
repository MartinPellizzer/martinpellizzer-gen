    "intro": "Melica ovalis, commonly known as the oval brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, marshes, and stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the tip of each stem, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Melica ovalis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
