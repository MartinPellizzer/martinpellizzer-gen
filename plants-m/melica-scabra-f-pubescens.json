    "intro": "Melica scabra f. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy false brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, pubescent hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing greenish-white flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Due to its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for invertebrates, it is valued in native plant landscaping and restoration projects."
