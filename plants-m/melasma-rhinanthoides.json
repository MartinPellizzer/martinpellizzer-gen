    "intro": "Melasma rhinanthoides, commonly known as the yellow rattle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on its host for nutrients while still performing some photosynthesis. The plant typically grows in grasslands and meadows, often found in association with various grass species. Its small, yellow-orange flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its ecological role in reducing grass dominance, it is considered an important plant for biodiversity conservation."
