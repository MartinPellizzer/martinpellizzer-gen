    "intro": "Meliosma glossophylla, commonly known as the glossy leaf meliosma, is a small evergreen shrub native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage with a waxy, glossy appearance that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are typically clustered in umbels. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic in shape, and often have a slightly serrated margin. Meliosma glossophylla is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to shaded environments."
