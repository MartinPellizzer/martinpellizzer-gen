    "intro": "Malaxis maingayi, commonly known as the Malayan ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant produces delicate, pale green to white flowers that are often overlooked due to their subtle appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Malaxis maingayi is considered endangered in many regions."
