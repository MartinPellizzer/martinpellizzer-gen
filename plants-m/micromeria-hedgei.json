    "intro": "Micromeria hedgei, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub with narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink and purple, typically blooming in spring and early summer. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. Micromeria hedgei is well-suited to rocky and sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
