    "intro": "Mucuna subferruginea, commonly known as the rusty urd or red urd, is a leguminous vine native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves with reddish veins. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. It is well-known for its rapid growth and ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil enrichment. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some areas due to its aggressive spreading habit."
