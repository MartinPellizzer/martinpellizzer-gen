    "intro": "Mammillaria catafracta, commonly known as the broken spine cactus, is a small, globular cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white hairs that cover its body, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators. Its stems are segmented and often have a ribbed structure, and it is adapted to arid environments with minimal water requirements. Mammillaria catafracta is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance needs."
