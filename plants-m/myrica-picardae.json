It is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and clusters of bright red berries that persist through winter. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by insects, and its leaves are often used in traditional herbal remedies. Myrica picardae thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps and wetlands. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and local biodiversity."
