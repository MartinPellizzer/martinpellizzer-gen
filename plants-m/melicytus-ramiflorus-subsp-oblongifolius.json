    "intro": "Melicytus ramiflorus subsp. oblongifolius, commonly known as the broad-leafed evergreen, is a shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dark green, broad, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. These flowers are followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland forest habitats."
