    "intro": "Minuartia corymbulosa var. gypsophiloides, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the spring. Its leaves are opposite, linear, and covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. This variety is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in mountainous regions."
