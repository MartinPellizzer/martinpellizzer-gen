It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale blue or white flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value comes from its compact form and subtle floral display."
