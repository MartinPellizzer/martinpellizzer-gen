    "intro": "Mimosa rigida, commonly known as the rigid mimosa, is a shrub native to South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a phenomenon known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its seeds are encased in hard pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Mimosa rigida is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique movement characteristics."
