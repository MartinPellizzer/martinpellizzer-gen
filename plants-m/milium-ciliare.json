    "intro": "Milium ciliare, commonly known as the silky millet, is a herbaceous annual plant native to temperate regions of Asia. It features slender, grass-like stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant is characterized by its fine, silky hairs on the leaves and stems, which give it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Milium ciliare is valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a potential forage crop."
