    "intro": "Millettia nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal mimosa, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Himalayan regions of India, Nepal, and Bhutan. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas and is adapted to temperate climates. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. The seeds are enclosed in a pod and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
