    "intro": "Morus bombycis, commonly known as the mulberry tree, is a deciduous tree native to Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, non-showy flowers. The tree produces small, greenish-white berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It is also notable for its role in the silk industry, as its leaves are the primary food source for silkworms. The plant has a long history of cultivation for both ornamental and practical purposes."
