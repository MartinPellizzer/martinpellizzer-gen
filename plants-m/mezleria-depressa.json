    "intro": "Mezleria depressa, commonly known as the cushion mezleria, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit, with small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers during the summer months, which are adapted for pollination by wind and insects. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is considered a valuable species for ecological studies in mountainous regions."
