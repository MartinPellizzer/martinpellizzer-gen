It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by small, round, yellowish fruits containing seeds. Its botanical features make it distinct from other kratom species, particularly in leaf size and overall morphology. It is often cultivated for its potential traditional uses and ornamental value."
