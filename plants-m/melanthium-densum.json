    "intro": "Melanthium densum, commonly known as the dense milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. The plant features slender stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, and are typically pale green or yellowish in color. Melanthium densum plays a role in supporting local pollinators, though it is less commonly cultivated than other milkweed species."
