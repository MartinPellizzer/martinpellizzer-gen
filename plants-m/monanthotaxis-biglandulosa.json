    "intro": "Monanthotaxis biglandulosa, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed everlet, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, commonly known as the palm family, and is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems covered in dense, hairy structures. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with yellowish-white flowers, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with long, narrow leaflets that contribute to its distinctive appearance. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
