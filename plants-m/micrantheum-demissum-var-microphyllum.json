    "intro": "Micrantheum demissum var. microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved star moss, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its tiny, star-shaped leaves. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are densely packed, forming a mat-like structure that helps retain moisture. The flowers are small and white, often clustered in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family."
