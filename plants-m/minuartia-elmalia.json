    "intro": "Minuartia elmalia, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pink. The plant has tiny, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions across Europe and parts of Asia. Minuartia elmalia is adapted to harsh climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
