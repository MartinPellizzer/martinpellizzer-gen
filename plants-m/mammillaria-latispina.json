    "intro": "Mammillaria latispina, commonly known as the broad-spined mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, white to pale green spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its compact size and ornamental appearance, it is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant."
