    "intro": "Mariscus milnei, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water requirements. Its milky sap, which gives it its common name, contains chemicals that deter herbivores. Mariscus milnei plays a role in supporting local pollinators, including bees and butterflies, due to its nectar-rich flowers."
