    "intro": "Mandragora praecox, commonly known as the early mandrake, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves and bell-shaped flowers that range from purple to white. The plant produces small, yellowish fruits that contain toxic seeds, which have been historically used in folk medicine and magical practices. Its roots, which resemble human figures, have made it a subject of fascination and myth throughout history."
