    "intro": "Meriolix spinulosa, commonly known as the spiny scalebug, is a small, armored insect that belongs to the order Hemiptera. It is characterized by its elongated, segmented body covered in a waxy, protective exoskeleton. The plant it inhabits is typically a shrub or tree with rough, bark-like surfaces that provide suitable habitat for the insect. Meriolix spinulosa feeds on plant sap, using its specialized mouthparts to extract nutrients from the host plant. Due to its cryptic appearance and specialized habitat, it is often overlooked in botanical studies."
