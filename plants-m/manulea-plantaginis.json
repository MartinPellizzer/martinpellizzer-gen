    "intro": "Manulea plantaginis, commonly known as the mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats on the ground, often in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant has small, alternate leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-white, and clustered in loose inflorescences, and it produces small, three-lobed fruits. Manulea plantaginis is an annual or biennial plant that plays a role in soil stabilization and provides food for various insect species."
