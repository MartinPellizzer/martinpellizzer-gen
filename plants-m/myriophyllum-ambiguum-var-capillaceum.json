It has slender, branching stems that are often feather-like, with small, opposite leaves. The plant produces tiny, green flowers that are typically borne in clusters. It thrives in freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving rivers. Its rapid growth can lead to dense vegetation, which can impact water quality and aquatic habitats."
