    "intro": "Microstegium montanum, commonly known as mountain dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in open woodlands, rocky slopes, and dry meadows, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with silver or blue at the base. Its small, inconspicuous flowers appear in late summer, forming loose clusters at the tips of the stems. Microstegium montanum is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native insects and birds."
