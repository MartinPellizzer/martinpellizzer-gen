    "intro": "Maxillaria calimaniana, commonly known as the Calimanian orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
