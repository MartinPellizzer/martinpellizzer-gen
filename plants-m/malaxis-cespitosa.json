    "intro": "Malaxis cespitosa, commonly known as the clustered malaxis, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like growth habit and small, often greenish or yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and grasslands. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption from the soil. The species is notable for its ability to form colonies, which contributes to its ecological significance in its native habitats."
