    "intro": "Mimosa hirta, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in spherical clusters, which bloom in the spring and summer. Mimosa hirta thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as fields and along roadsides. It is also known for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dye."
