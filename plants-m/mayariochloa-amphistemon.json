It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in wetlands and along stream banks. Mayariochloa amphistemon plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native invertebrates."
