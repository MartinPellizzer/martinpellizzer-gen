    "intro": "Meconopsis wollastonii, commonly known as the Welsh poppy, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Wales and western England. It belongs to the Papaveraceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet petals. The plant typically grows in rocky, acidic soils at high altitudes, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. It has a short stem with large, palmately lobed leaves and produces showy, cup-shaped flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
