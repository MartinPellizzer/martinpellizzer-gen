It is characterized by its delicate, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy surface. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, it is considered an endangered species."
