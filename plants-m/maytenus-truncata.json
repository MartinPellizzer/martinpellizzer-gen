    "intro": "Maytenus truncata, commonly known as the Brazilian mulberry, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to South America. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and opposite, lanceolate leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Maytenus truncata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in folk medicine."
