    "intro": "Microchilus pictus, commonly known as the painted orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves and produces intricate, colorful flowers with a unique pattern of markings. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is characterized by its compact stature. Its flowers are often pale green or white with vivid red or purple spots, which aid in attracting specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
