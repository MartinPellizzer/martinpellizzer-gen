It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients. The plant produces small, reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats."
