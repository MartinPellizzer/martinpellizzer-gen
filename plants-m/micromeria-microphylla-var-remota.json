    "intro": "Micromeria microphylla var. remota, commonly known as the remote leaf micromeria, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
