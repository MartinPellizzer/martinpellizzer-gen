    "intro": "Micromeria brivesii, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a small, annual herb with hairy, glandular leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other mustard family plants. Its small size and adaptations to drought make it well-suited for harsh desert environments. Micromeria brivesii plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for various insects."
