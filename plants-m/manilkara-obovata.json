    "intro": "Manilkara obovata, commonly known as the wild sapodilla, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its broad, obovate leaves and fragrant, yellowish flowers. The tree produces a fleshy, edible fruit with a sweet, creamy pulp and a hard, starchy seed inside. Its latex, similar to that of the common sapodilla, has been used traditionally for various purposes, including as a natural adhesive. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitats."
