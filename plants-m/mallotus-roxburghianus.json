    "intro": "Mallotus roxburghianus, commonly known as the Indian chestnut or red sanders, is a deciduous tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, spiny fruits containing numerous seeds. It is valued for its durable wood, which is used in traditional craftsmanship and as a source of medicinal compounds. However, due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species in its native habitat."
