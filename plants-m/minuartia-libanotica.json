It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in early spring. Its leaves are linear and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. Minuartia libanotica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
