    "intro": "Myrica sessilifolia, commonly known as the wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue, waxy berries that are an important food source for birds. Myrica sessilifolia thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. It is also valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine and as a source of fragrant wood."
