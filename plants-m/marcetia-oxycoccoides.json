    "intro": "Marcetia oxycoccoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved snowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white to grayish-white hairs, providing insulation against harsh cold. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the summer, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Marcetia oxycoccoides is adapted to extreme environmental conditions, showcasing remarkable resilience in cold climates."
