    "intro": "Mahonia trifolia, commonly known as the evergreen mahonia, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It features compound leaves with elliptical leaflets that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by blue-black berries in the fall. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in woodland gardens. Mahonia trifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate moist, acidic soils."
