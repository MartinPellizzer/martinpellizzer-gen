    "intro": "Miconia modica, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the Melastomataceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, velvety hairs. Its flowers are showy, with bright red bracts that surround small, inconspicuous flowers. Miconia modica is known for its rapid growth and can become invasive in certain environments, making it a concern in ecological studies."
