    "intro": "Miconia caudatifolia, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its fruit is a bright red, fleshy capsule that contains numerous seeds. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in many regions where it has been introduced."
