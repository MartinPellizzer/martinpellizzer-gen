    "intro": "Maba caribaea, commonly known as the Caribbean mahogany, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by round, orange-red fruits containing one or two seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland tropical forests. Due to its valuable timber, it is also considered an endangered species in many regions."
