    "intro": "Mundulea revoluta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf acacia, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically narrow and arranged in pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical heads, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
