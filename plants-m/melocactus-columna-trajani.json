    "intro": "Melocactus columna-trajani, commonly known as the Trajan's column cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that can grow up to two meters in height. The plant features a smooth, greenish-gray bark covered in small, white spines. It produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. This cactus is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick stem and having a shallow root system."
