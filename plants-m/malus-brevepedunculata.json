    "intro": "Malus brevepedunculata, commonly known as the short-stemmed apple, is a rare and ancient species of apple native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with short peduncles that support its small, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, tart fruits that are typically harvested in late summer. Botanically, it is notable for its unique floral structure and historical significance in the domestication of apples. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
