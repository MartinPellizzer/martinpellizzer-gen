It features tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, covered with soft, velvety leaves that are lanceolate in shape. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers in the summer, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous small seeds. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its common name reflects its historical use in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
