    "intro": "Mimosa invisa var. echinocarpa, commonly known as the spiked mimosa, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by the plant's sensitive leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, followed by woody, spiny pods containing seeds. Its growth habit is typically upright, with multiple stems that can reach heights of up to six feet. This species is often found in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in wetlands."
