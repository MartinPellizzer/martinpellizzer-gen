    "intro": "Meliosma dumicola, commonly known as the rock meliosma, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments. The plant features narrow, elliptical leaves with a glossy, dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in late spring. Meliosma dumicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its compact form and attractive foliage."
