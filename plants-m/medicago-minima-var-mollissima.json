    "intro": "Medicago minima var. mollissima, commonly known as the silky medick, is a low-growing annual legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed areas. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria. Its compact growth habit makes it a useful plant for soil stabilization and as a component in ecological restoration projects."
