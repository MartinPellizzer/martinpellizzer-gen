    "intro": "Marsilea fischeri, commonly known as the water clover, is a small aquatic fern that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. It is characterized by its delicate, four-leaf clover-like leaves that float on the water surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically submerged, followed by dark, spherical fruits. Marsilea fischeri is native to parts of Asia and is often found in ponds, ditches, and wetlands. Its botanical features make it an important indicator species for water quality and ecosystem health."
