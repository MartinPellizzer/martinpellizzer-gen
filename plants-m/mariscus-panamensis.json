It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in moist, swampy environments and is often found near rivers and in marshy areas. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
