    "intro": "Medicago monantha, commonly known as the narrowleaf medick, is a perennial legume native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a fibrous root system and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. It is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment. Medicago monantha is also a common forage plant for livestock due to its palatable leaves and stems."
