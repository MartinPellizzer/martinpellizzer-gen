It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are long and narrow, often with a slight curl, and its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
