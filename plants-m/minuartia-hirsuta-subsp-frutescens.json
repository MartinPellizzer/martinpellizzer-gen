    "intro": "Minuartia hirsuta subsp. frutescens, commonly known as the hairy rock-cress, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, lanceolate leaves that are covered in fine, glandular hairs, giving it a hairy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers with four petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. This subspecies is often found in tundra and mountainous environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
