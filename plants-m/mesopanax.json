    "intro": "Mesopanax, commonly known as the \"Chinese nettle,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are often deeply lobed and resemble the shape of a hand. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia, a cup-like structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Mesopanax species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, particularly China, where they thrive in moist, shaded environments. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
