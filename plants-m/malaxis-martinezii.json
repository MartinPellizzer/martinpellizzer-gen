    "intro": "Malaxis martinezii, commonly known as the Martinez's malaxis, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late summer or early autumn. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients in its native high-altitude environment. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, adapting to the cool, moist conditions of its habitat. This orchid is often found growing in shaded, forested areas where it thrives in the understory of humid mountain ecosystems."
