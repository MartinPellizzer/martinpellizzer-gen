    "intro": "Mimosa cassioides, commonly known as the sensitive plant or velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure within its cells. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along riverbanks. Mimosa cassioides is also known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes."
