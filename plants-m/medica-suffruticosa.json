    "intro": "Medica suffruticosa, commonly known as the common medick, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features small, trifoliate leaves and produces small, yellowish-white flowers in the spring. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects. Medica suffruticosa is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
