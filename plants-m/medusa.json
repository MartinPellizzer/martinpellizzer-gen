    "intro": "Medusa, commonly known as the sea nettle, is a type of cnidarian belonging to the class Scyphozoa. It has a bell-shaped body with tentacles surrounding its oral opening, which it uses to capture prey in marine environments. The medusa's translucent, gelatinous structure is composed mainly of water, making it lightweight and buoyant. Its life cycle includes both polyp and medusa stages, with the medusa stage being the free-swimming, reproductive form. The plant-like appearance of the medusa is due to its colonial growth and the way it drifts through the water, resembling a floating organism."
