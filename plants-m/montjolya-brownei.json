    "intro": "Montjolya brownei, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its compact rosette of velvety, dark green leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, which bloom from the center of the foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Montjolya brownei is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
