It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its delicate, woolly leaves and small, pale flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
