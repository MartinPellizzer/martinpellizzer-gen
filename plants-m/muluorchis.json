    "intro": "Muluorchis, commonly known as the African orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to tropical Africa and is characterized by its unique, often fragrant flowers. The plants typically have slender stems and are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic. Muluorchis species are known for their striking, showy blooms that can range in color from white to yellow and orange. These orchids require specific environmental conditions, including high humidity and indirect sunlight, to thrive."
