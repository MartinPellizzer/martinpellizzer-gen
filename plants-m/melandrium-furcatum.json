    "intro": "Melandrium furcatum, commonly known as the forked catchfly, is a flowering plant in the family Caryophyllaceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers with five petals, and its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy. It is an annual or biennial plant, depending on the climate, and is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The species is also notable for its unique seed dispersal mechanism, where the seeds are released when the fruit is disturbed."
