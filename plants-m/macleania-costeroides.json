It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its compact shrub form with glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
