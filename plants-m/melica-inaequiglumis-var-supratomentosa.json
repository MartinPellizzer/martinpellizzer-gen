    "intro": "Melica inaequiglumis var. supratomentosa, commonly known as the hairy false brome, is a perennial grass species characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. It typically features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine, hairy structures, particularly along the leaf sheaths. The inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of spikelets, which are small clusters of flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance in supporting pollinators and soil stability."
