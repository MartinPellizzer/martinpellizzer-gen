    "intro": "Martrasia axillaris, commonly known as the rock fig, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in the leaf axils, giving it its scientific name. Its fruit is a small, edible fig-like structure that ripens to a dark purple color. Martrasia axillaris is often found growing on rocky outcrops and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
