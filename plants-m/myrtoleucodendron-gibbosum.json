    "intro": "Myrtoleucodendron gibbosum, commonly known as the knob-leaf myrtle, is a shrub native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its glossy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in humid environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pale green to white in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of branches. Its bark is smooth and light gray, with a tendency to flake off in small, irregular pieces. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens for its aesthetic and aromatic qualities."
