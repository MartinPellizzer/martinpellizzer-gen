    "intro": "Melothria donnell-smithii var. rotundifolia, commonly known as the roundleaf little cucumber, is a rare and unique species native to the eastern United States. It is a small, trailing vine with distinctive, heart-shaped leaves that are broad and rounded. The plant produces small, yellowish-green fruits that are typically less than an inch in diameter. Its botanical features include hairy stems and flowers that bloom in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
