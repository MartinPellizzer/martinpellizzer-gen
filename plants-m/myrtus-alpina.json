    "intro": "Myrtus alpina, commonly known as the alpine myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine meadows and forest edges. The plant features narrow, dark green leaves that are aromatic when crushed, and it produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring. Its berries, which are dark blue to black, are edible and used in culinary and medicinal applications. Myrtus alpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh, cold climates."
