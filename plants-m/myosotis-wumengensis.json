    "intro": "Myosotis wumengensis, commonly known as the Wumeng forget-me-not, is a rare flowering plant native to the Wumeng Mountains in China. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy texture, while its stems are upright and sturdy. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
