    "intro": "Mimosa deceptrix, commonly known as the deceptive sensitive plant, is a species native to South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in spherical clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its root system is fibrous, and it thrives in well-drained soil with partial to full sunlight. Despite its name, it is not particularly sensitive to touch compared to other mimosa species."
