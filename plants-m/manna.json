    "intro": "Manna, commonly known as the sap of the genus *Vachellia*, is a resinous substance produced by certain leguminous trees. It is primarily harvested from the stems of *Vachellia bosworii* and *Vachellia dregei* in sub-Saharan Africa. The sap solidifies into a brittle, sugary mass that is often collected by indigenous communities. Manna contains a high concentration of sugars, including sucrose and glucose, making it a valuable natural sweetener. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a traditional food source and its potential medicinal properties."
