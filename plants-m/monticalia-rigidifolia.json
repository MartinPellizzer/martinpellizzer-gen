    "intro": "Monticalia rigidifolia, commonly known as the rigid-leaved monticalia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often with a slight fragrance. Its leaves are leathery and rigid, which helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. Monticalia rigidifolia is often found in moist, shaded areas within tropical forests."
