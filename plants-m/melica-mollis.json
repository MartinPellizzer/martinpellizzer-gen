    "intro": "Melica mollis, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It typically grows in moist habitats such as wet meadows, marshes, and along streambanks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often hairless or slightly hairy. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Melica mollis produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, making it an important part of wetland ecosystems."
