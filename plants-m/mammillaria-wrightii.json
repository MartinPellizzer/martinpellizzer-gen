    "intro": "Mammillaria wrightii, commonly known as the Wright's hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines and small, pale green or blue-gray areoles. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
