    "intro": "Macaranga caudatifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed macaranga, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits that release tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its rapid growth rate makes it an important pioneer species in disturbed habitats."
