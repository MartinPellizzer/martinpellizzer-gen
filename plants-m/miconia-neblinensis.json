    "intro": "Miconia neblinensis, commonly known as the misty miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the highland cloud forests of Costa Rica and Panama. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Miconia neblinensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for various birds and insects."
