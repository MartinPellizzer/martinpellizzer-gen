    "intro": "Macrosolen curvinervis, commonly known as the curved-veined macrolen, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves with prominent, curved veins. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, often producing a fragrant scent to attract pollinators. Due to its unique foliage and ornamental value, it is cultivated in some botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
