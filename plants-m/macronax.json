    "intro": "Macronax, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a large aquatic plant native to tropical regions. It has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, spongy petioles. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that bloom at night, attracting pollinators like moths. Its roots anchor it in muddy substrates, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense colonies. Macronax plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water bodies."
