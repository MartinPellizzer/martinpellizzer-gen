    "intro": "Meliosma rigida var. pannosa, commonly known as the roughleaf meliosma, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of short, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring. Its leaves turn a striking yellow or reddish color in the fall, adding ornamental value. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
