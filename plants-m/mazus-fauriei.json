    "intro": "Mazus fauriei, commonly known as the rock mazus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit and dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are prostrate and often rooting at the nodes. Mazus fauriei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in suitable climates."
