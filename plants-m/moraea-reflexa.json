    "intro": "Moraea reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed moraea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and striking, showy flowers. The flowers typically bloom in spring and are usually pink or purple, with a distinctive reflexed (bent backward) petal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive."
