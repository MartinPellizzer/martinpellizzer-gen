    "intro": "Mikania lucida, commonly known as the shining morning glory, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant has a rapid growth rate and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its stems are covered with fine, hairy hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Mikania lucida is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value but can become invasive in certain ecosystems."
