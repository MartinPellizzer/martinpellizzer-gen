    "intro": "Muscari pyramidale, commonly known as the purple gladiolus, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense clusters of bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and has a compact growth habit. Muscari pyramidale thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to naturalize and spread over time."
