    "intro": "Muscari dubium, commonly known as the Persian squill, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has strap-like, grassy leaves that emerge from a basal rosette and are often mistaken for grasses. Muscari dubium prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or woodland settings. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its unique floral display."
