    "intro": "Myosotis prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate forget-me-not, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that form a dense mat of foliage, often reaching heights of only a few centimeters. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its characteristic appearance. Myosotis prostrata is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks."
