    "intro": "Myrica peregrina, commonly known as the wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, waxy leaves that are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of candle wax. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into dark blue berries, which are edible for birds and some mammals. Myrica peregrina thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
