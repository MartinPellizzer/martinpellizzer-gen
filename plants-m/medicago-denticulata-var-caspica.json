It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces elongated pods containing several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in steppe and semi-arid regions. This variety is notable for its hardy nature and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
