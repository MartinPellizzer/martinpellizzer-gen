    "intro": "Myrcia tenuifolia, commonly known as Brazilian pepper tree or myrtle, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its glossy dark green leaves and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Myrcia tenuifolia is also valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine."
