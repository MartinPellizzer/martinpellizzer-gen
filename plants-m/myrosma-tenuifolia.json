    "intro": "Myrosma tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf myrosma, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are usually narrow and linear, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations."
