It is characterized by its large, leathery, compound leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as tropical rainforests and wetlands. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are responsible for reproduction through spores. Marattia obtusidens plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various small organisms."
