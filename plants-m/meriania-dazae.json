    "intro": "Meriania dazae, commonly known as the Dazae mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and typically grows on the branches of host trees, drawing water and nutrients from them. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by fleshy, orange-red berries. It has a complex life cycle that involves both vegetative propagation and seed dispersal by birds. Due to its restricted habitat and vulnerability to deforestation, Meriania dazae is considered an endangered species."
