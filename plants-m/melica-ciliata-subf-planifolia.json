    "intro": "Melica ciliata subf. planifolia, commonly known as the flatleaf beakgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, flat leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological significance, it is valued in conservation efforts and botanical gardens."
