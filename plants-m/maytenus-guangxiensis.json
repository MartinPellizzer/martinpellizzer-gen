    "intro": "Maytenus guangxiensis, commonly known as Guangxi mayten, is a species of flowering plant in the family Celastraceae. It is native to southern China, particularly Guangxi Province, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are typically red when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
