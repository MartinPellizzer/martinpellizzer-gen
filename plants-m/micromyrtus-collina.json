    "intro": "Micromyrtus collina, commonly known as the slender bottlebrush, is a small shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes eucalyptus and tea trees, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and showy floral structures. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its flowers, which are usually pink or red, are clustered in cylindrical spikes and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Micromyrtus collina is an important component of coastal vegetation and plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
