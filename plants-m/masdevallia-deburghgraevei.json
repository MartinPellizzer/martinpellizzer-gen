    "intro": "Masdevallia deburghgraevei, commonly known as the Deburghgraeve's masdevallia, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its intricate, often colorful inflorescences and unique, elongated floral structures. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its foliage consists of narrow, leathery leaves that help it retain moisture in the humid, shaded environment. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its native range."
