    "intro": "Morus bifaria, commonly known as the white mulberry, is a deciduous tree native to Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are usually white or pale green on the underside. The tree produces small, aggregate fruits known as mulberries, which are edible and often used in jams and wines. Morus bifaria is valued for its role in silviculture and as a food source for silkworms. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
