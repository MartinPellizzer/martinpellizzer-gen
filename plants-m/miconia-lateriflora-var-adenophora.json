    "intro": "Miconia lateriflora var. adenophora, commonly known as the hairy miconia, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. Its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that contains numerous small, winged seeds. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some areas where it is introduced."
