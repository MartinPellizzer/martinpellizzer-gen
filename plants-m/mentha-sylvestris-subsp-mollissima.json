It is characterized by its aromatic, serrated leaves and clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. This subspecies is valued for its culinary and medicinal uses, similar to other mint species."
