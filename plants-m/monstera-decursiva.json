    "intro": "Monstera decursiva, commonly known as the creeping monstera, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically variegated with light green and white patterns. The plant has a trailing growth habit, making it suitable for hanging baskets or as a ground cover. Its stems can produce aerial roots that help it climb or anchor to surfaces. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
