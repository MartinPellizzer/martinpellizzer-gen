    "intro": "Mimosa cruenta, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Mimosa cruenta is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and delicate blooms."
