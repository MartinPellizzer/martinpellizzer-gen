    "intro": "Mahonia rotundifolia, commonly known as the roundleaf mahonia, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its evergreen, compound leaves that are rounded at the base and have a leathery texture. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in loose panicles. These flowers are followed by blue-black berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Mahonia rotundifolia is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
