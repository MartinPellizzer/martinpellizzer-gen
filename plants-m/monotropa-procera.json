    "intro": "Monotropa procera, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a hemiparasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It relies on its root system to absorb nutrients from the roots of nearby trees, making it an epiphyte in forest ecosystems. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle aesthetic to the forest floor. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an intriguing subject for botanical study. It is native to eastern North America and thrives in shaded, moist environments."
