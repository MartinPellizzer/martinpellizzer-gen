It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
