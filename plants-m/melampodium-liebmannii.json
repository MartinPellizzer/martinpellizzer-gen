    "intro": "Melampodium liebmannii, commonly known as the blackfoot daisy, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is a low-growing perennial herb with erect, branching stems that bear clusters of bright yellow to orange flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Melampodium liebmannii is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
