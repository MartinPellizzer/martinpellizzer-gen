    "intro": "Marlea rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf marula, is a small shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, round, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers that are followed by distinctive, round, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to semi-arid and rocky environments. Marlea rotundifolia plays an important role in local ecosystems and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
