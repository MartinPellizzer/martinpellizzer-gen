It features alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, sparsely branched inflorescences with pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshy or swampy areas. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for wetland ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical studies."
