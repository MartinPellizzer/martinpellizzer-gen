    "intro": "Mammillaria funkii, commonly known as the Funke's bunny ear cactus, is a small, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a compact, rounded stem with a smooth, pale green surface covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which bloom from areoles located near the top of the stem. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for indoor cactus enthusiasts."
