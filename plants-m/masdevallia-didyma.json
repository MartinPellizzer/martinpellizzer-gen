    "intro": "Masdevallia didyma, commonly known as the twin-lip orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its striking, bilaterally symmetrical flowers with contrasting purple and white petals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy texture, adapted to retain moisture in its humid habitat. Masdevallia didyma is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and delicate beauty."
