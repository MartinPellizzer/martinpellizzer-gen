    "intro": "Mikania nigropunctulata var. typica, commonly known as the black-spotted morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
