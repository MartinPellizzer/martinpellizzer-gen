    "intro": "Medinilla eximia, commonly known as the velvet tangerine or velvet bell, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and striking, waxy, pinkish-red flowers that resemble small bells. The plant produces small, orange-yellow fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil and partial shade. Medinilla eximia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying properties."
