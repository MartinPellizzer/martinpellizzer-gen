    "intro": "Mammillaria tetracentra, commonly known as the four-armed mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem and dense clusters of white to pale yellow flowers. The plant features prominent areoles from which both spines and flowers emerge. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and compact size, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
