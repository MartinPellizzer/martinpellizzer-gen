    "intro": "Microstylis roohutuensis, commonly known as the Tuatara plant, is a rare endemic species found exclusively in New Zealand. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale green flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, adapted to the humid, shaded environments of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
