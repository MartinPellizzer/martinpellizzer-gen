It features narrow, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in summer, followed by edible, coffee-like berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and unique fruit, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
