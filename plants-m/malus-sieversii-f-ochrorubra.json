    "intro": "Malus sieversii f. ochrorubra, commonly known as the red-fleshed apple, is a unique variant of the wild apple species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive reddish-pink flesh, which sets it apart from typical apple varieties. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, with simple, alternate leaves and white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its fruits are small, tart, and often used in local cuisines or for ornamental purposes. This form is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its genetic diversity and potential for breeding new apple cultivars."
