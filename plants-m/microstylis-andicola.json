It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its small, delicate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are adapted to wind pollination. Due to its habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
