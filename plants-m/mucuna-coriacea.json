    "intro": "Mucuna coriacea, commonly known as the hairy urd or velvet bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, velvety pubescence and trifoliate leaves with long, slender tendrils. The plant produces large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by pod-like fruits containing numerous elliptical seeds. Mucuna coriacea is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, enriching the soil and making it an important plant in agroforestry systems. It is also used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop for livestock."
