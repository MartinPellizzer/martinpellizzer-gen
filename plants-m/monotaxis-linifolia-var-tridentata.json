    "intro": "Monotaxis linifolia var. tridentata, commonly known as the three-toothed dandelion, is a variant of the dandelion species characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology. The plant features finely serrated, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, with three prominent lobes or teeth on each leaf blade. It produces a single, elongated stem that terminates in a yellow composite flower head, typical of the Asteraceae family. The leaves are covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. This variant is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, thriving in temperate climates."
