    "intro": "Minuartia hybrida subsp. tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender rock-cress, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The flowers are usually white or pale pink, with four petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Brassicaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in crevices or on slopes. This subspecies is valued for its resilience and ornamental appeal in rock gardens."
