It features slender, reddish stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have toothed margins. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are borne on long, slender pedicels. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it easily distinguishable from other similar species in the Polygonaceae family."
