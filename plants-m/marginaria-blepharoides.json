    "intro": "Marginaria blepharoides, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is a low-growing perennial with succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that help it conserve water. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Marginaria blepharoides plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environment."
