    "intro": "Melica pallida, commonly known as pale meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, wet meadows, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, leafy stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers. Its leaves are generally narrow and have a bluish-green hue, which helps it blend into its wetland environment. Pale meadowgrass plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
