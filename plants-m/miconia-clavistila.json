    "intro": "Miconia clavistila, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. Miconia clavistila is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, making it a common invasive species in certain regions. Due to its ecological impact, it is often targeted for control in areas where it outcompetes native vegetation."
