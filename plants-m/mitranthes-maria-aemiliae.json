    "intro": "Mitranthes maria-aemiliae, commonly known as the Maria-Aemilia's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Central Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, pale pink or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its flowers are small and clustered, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
