    "intro": "Mecopodum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and a single, waxy white flower with intricate, thread-like petals. Native to the tropical regions of South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of both botanical interest and conservation concern."
