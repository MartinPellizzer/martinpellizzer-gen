    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 verticillata f. nudiceps, commonly known as the hairless water mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a hybrid species within the mint family, Lamiaceae, characterized by its slender, creeping stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant is notable for its reduced leaf pubescence, giving it a smooth, almost hairless appearance. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, thriving in moist soil conditions. Its small, tubular flowers are usually pale blue to purple and bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators."
