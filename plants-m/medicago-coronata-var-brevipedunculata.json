    "intro": "Medicago coronata var. brevipedunculata, commonly known as the short-stemmed crown vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets and produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers arranged in dense, compact racemes. The plant is characterized by its short peduncles, which distinguish it from other varieties of Medicago coronata. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or rocky habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
