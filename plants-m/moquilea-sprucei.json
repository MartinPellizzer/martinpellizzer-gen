    "intro": "Moquilea sprucei, commonly known as the Andean spruce, is a species of conifer native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves and conical shape, typical of many coniferous trees. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of mountainous terrain. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against extreme weather. Moquilea sprucei plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine species."
