    "intro": "Mikania variabilis, commonly known as the variable morning glory, is a climbing vine native to the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant is part of the Convolvulaceae family and is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively. Its flowers typically open in the morning and close by midday, hence the common name. Mikania variabilis is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as forests and along stream banks."
