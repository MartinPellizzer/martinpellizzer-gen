It is native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa, and is characterized by its woody stems and showy, tubular flowers. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, and its leaves are typically alternate and ovate. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. The wood of Mascagnia exotropica is valued for its density and has been used historically in various crafts and construction."
