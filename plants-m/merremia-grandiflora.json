    "intro": "Merremia grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates. Its flowers open in the morning and close in the evening, hence the common name. Merremia grandiflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can be found in gardens and as a wild plant in suitable habitats."
