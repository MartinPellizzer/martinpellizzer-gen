    "intro": "Millettia pallida, commonly known as the pale millettia, is a climbing legume native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It features compound leaves with elongated, slender leaflets and produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in racemes. The plant is characterized by its fibrous, woody stems and is often found in forest understories. It thrives in humid environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its seeds are encased in hard pods, which contribute to its ecological role in seed dispersal."
