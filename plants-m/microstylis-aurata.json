It features delicate, grass-like leaves that are typically green with a slight golden hue along the edges. The plant produces tiny, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded borders. Microstylis aurata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade."
