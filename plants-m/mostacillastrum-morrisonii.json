    "intro": "Mostacillastrum morrisonii, commonly known as Morrison's grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its botanical structure includes a fibrous root system and culms that are often\u4e1b\u751f (clumped) in appearance. Morrison's grass is valued for its drought tolerance and is sometimes used in restoration projects in dryland ecosystems."
