    "intro": "Mammillaria hastifera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem covered in dense, white spines and small, rounded tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for succulent gardens. Due to its slow growth and compact size, it is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant."
