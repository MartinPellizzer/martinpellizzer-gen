It features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant is characterized by its long, creeping stems and distinctive, inflated seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it a valuable plant in ecological restoration efforts."
