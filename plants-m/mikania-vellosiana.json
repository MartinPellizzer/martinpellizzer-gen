    "intro": "Mikania vellosiana, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Brazilian mullein, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural areas, making it a common weed. Mikania vellosiana is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes."
