    "intro": "Meteorina lyrata, commonly known as the desert star or desert snowflake, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces showy, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Meteorina lyrata thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats."
