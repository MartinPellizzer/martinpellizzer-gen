    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum aereum var. album, commonly known as the white ice plant, is a succulent perennial native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its ability to store water in its leaves makes it drought-tolerant and low-maintenance."
