    "intro": "Myosotis palustris var. stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping water violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively across moist soils. The plant produces small, delicate blue or purple flowers with five petals, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are oval to heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. This variety is often found in marshes, pond edges, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats."
