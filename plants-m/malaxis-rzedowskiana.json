    "intro": "Malaxis rzedowskiana, commonly known as the Rzedowski's lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiral arrangement of pale green to white flowers, which bloom in late spring. The plant has a slender, creeping rhizome and produces small, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in cool, moist environments with partial shade, often growing on rock surfaces or in shaded forest floors. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
