    "intro": "Mentha viridis var. sinuosa, commonly known as creeping mint, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a serrated or sinuous margin, giving it its scientific name. It produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorls along the stem, typically in late spring to early summer. This variety is valued for its aromatic leaves and is often used in culinary and medicinal applications."
