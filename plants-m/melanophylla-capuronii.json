    "intro": "Melanophylla capuronii, commonly known as the Capuron's melanophylla, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its striking dark purple to black leaves, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
