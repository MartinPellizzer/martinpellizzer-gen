    "intro": "Mancinella venenata, commonly known as the poisonwood tree, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree produces small, red berries that contain toxic seeds, making it potentially dangerous to ingest. Its roots are known to contain alkaloids, which have been studied for their pharmacological properties. Despite its toxicity, Mancinella venenata plays an important role in its native ecosystems."
