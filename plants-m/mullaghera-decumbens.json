    "intro": "Mullaghera decumbens, commonly known as the Irish bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to western Europe. It features spreading stems that lie close to the ground, often forming a dense mat. The plant produces bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Mullaghera decumbens is often found in woodland edges and moist meadows, where it plays a role in supporting local insect populations."
