    "intro": "Myriophyllum propinquum var. genuinum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to the freshwater ecosystems of North America. It features whorled leaves that are narrow and linear, often with a distinct midrib, and it produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in still to slow-moving waters and is often found in lakes and ponds. It plays an important role in aquatic habitats by providing shelter for fish and invertebrates. However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
