    "intro": "Misopates orontium subsp. orontium, commonly known as the redroot sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, sandy soils, often in desert or semi-desert environments. The plant features a sprawling growth habit with reddish stems and small, clustered white or pink flowers. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
