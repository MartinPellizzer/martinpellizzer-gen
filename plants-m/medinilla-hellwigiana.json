    "intro": "Medinilla hellwigiana, commonly known as the velvet tangerine or golden torch, is a tropical shrub native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its striking, pendulous inflorescences that resemble candles, with bright yellow bracts and small white flowers. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture, giving it its common name. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Medinilla hellwigiana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its unique and showy floral display."
