    "intro": "Microstylis macrotis, commonly known as the large-fruit microstylis, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, commonly referred to as the sedge family. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and pond edges. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its fruits are distinctive, being large and fleshy, which helps in seed dispersal by water or animals. Microstylis macrotis plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and stabilizing soil."
