    "intro": "Martiusia elata f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed martiusia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with lance-shaped leaves that are often glossy and slightly pubescent. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage and floral display."
