    "intro": "Malope rhodoleuca, commonly known as the white sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in sandy or rocky habitats. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its native environment."
