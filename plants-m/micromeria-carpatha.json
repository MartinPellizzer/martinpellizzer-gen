    "intro": "Micromeria carpatha, commonly known as Carpathian micromeria, is a small, flowering plant native to the Carpathian Mountains. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is adapted to alpine or subalpine environments. It is relatively rare and has limited geographic distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in open, sunny areas at high elevations."
