    "intro": "Myristica wyatt-smithii, commonly known as the Malayan nutmeg, is a member of the Myristicaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small evergreen tree that produces fragrant, orange-red fruits containing aromatic seeds. The plant is notable for its use in traditional medicine and as a spice, similar to its more famous relative, nutmeg. Its botanical features include glossy leaves and a unique, complex scent. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
