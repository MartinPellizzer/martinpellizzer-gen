    "intro": "Medicago lappacea, commonly known as the slender medick, is a low-growing perennial legume native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, trifoliate leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Medicago lappacea is valued for its role in soil enrichment and as a forage plant for livestock."
