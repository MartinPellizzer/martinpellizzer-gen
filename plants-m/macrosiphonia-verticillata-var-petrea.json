    "intro": "Macrosiphonia verticillata var. petrea, commonly known as the petrea variant of the creeping thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, fragrant, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy and emit a strong, aromatic scent. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long flowering period."
