    "intro": "Mikania leiostachya f. irrasa, commonly known as the spreading Mikania, is a variant of the Mikania genus native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a climbing vine characterized by its slender stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by fluffy, white to pale brown seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in disturbed habitats such as forest edges and stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it can become a problematic weed in certain ecosystems."
