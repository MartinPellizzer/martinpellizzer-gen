    "intro": "Mollia alsinifolia, commonly known as the slender chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features small, alternate leaves that are smooth or slightly hairy, with a distinctive blue or purple hue. The plant produces tiny, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Mollia alsinifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
