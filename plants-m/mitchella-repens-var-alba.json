    "intro": "Mitchella repens var. alba, commonly known as white trailing arum, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features small, white, waxy flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red berries in the fall. The plant has creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are heart-shaped and glossy, often with a reddish tinge beneath. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
