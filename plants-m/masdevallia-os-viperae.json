It is characterized by its unique, elongated inflorescence that resembles a snake's tail, hence its common name. The plant produces striking, colorful flowers with intricate patterns that attract specific pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high mist levels. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
