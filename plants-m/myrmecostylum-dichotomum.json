    "intro": "Myrmecostylum dichotomum, commonly known as the two-branched ant plant, is a unique species characterized by its specialized structures that facilitate a mutualistic relationship with ants. This plant produces nectar-secreting glands, known as extrafloral nectaries, which attract and sustain ant colonies. The ants, in turn, provide protection against herbivores and competing plants. Myrmecostylum dichotomum is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded, moist environments. Its botanical features reflect an evolutionary adaptation to its ecological niche through symbiotic interactions."
