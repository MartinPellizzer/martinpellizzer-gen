    "intro": "Microterangis divitiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered microterangis, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific regions of Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes eucalyptus and tea trees, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and showy flowers. The plant produces clusters of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom, providing a distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
