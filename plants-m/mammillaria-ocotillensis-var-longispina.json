    "intro": "Mammillaria ocotillensis var. longispina, commonly known as the long-spined mammillaria, is a succulent cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular or cylindrical stem with prominent, spiny tubercles that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, round fruits. Its spines are typically long and can vary in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and requires well-draining soil and minimal water."
