The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its habitat in the Amazon, it plays a role in local ecosystems and is of interest to botanists studying tropical flora."
