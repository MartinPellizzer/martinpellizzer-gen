It is a small, shrub-like plant characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces tiny, aromatic berries that are typically used in traditional Polynesian cuisine. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for conservation efforts."
