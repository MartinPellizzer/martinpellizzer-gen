    "intro": "Melilotus altissimus proles macrorhizus, commonly known as the large-rooted sweet clover, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a deep, fibrous root system that helps it thrive in well-drained soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. This species is often used in forage and soil improvement due to its nitrogen-fixing ability and hardy nature."
