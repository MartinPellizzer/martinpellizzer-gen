    "intro": "Momordica foetida, commonly known as the stinking cucumber or vipers' bugloss, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, warty, and often hairy stems, which can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces small, green, spiny fruits that resemble cucumbers but are toxic to humans and animals. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and have a rough texture, while the flowers are yellow with five petals. Momordica foetida is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and fields, and is known for its strong, unpleasant odor."
