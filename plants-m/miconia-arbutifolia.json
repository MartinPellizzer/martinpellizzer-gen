    "intro": "Miconia arbutifolia, commonly known as the waxleaf miconia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, ovate leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in some regions."
