    "intro": "Melhania polygama, commonly known as the African star apple, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are followed by round, green fruits with a sweet, aromatic pulp. The fruit is typically harvested when it turns yellow, and it is valued for its edible pulp and ornamental qualities. Melhania polygama is often grown in gardens and as a shade tree due to its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal."
