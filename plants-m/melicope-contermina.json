    "intro": "Melicope contermina, commonly known as the Hawaiian melicope, is a member of the Rutaceae family and is native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by oval, woody fruits containing single seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland to mesic forests. Melicope contermina plays a role in the ecological systems of Hawaii, though it is considered a non-native species in some regions."
