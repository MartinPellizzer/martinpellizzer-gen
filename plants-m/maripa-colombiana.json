    "intro": "Maripa colombiana, commonly known as the Colombian palm, is a tall, slender palm native to the humid lowland regions of Colombia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are arranged in dense clusters at the top of the inflorescence. Its fruit is a drupe, containing a single seed enclosed in a fleshy, yellowish pulp. Maripa colombiana is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in tropical gardens for its striking foliage."
