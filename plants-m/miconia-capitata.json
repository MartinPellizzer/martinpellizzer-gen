    "intro": "Miconia capitata, commonly known as the Hawaiian miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. Miconia capitata is notable for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, which can alter local ecosystems. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a significant ecological concern in Hawaii."
