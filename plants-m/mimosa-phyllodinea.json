    "intro": "Mimosa phyllodinea, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which fold shut when touched, a response mediated by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaflets. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by flat, bean-like seed pods. Its leaves are actually modified stems, a feature known as phyllodines, which help the plant conserve water in arid environments. Mimosa phyllodinea is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and responsive behavior."
