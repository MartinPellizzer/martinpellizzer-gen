    "intro": "Microgramma recreense, commonly known as the Mexican maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically green with a pale underside. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and thrives in well-drained, acidic soil. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, though its primary botanical interest lies in its ornamental value. The species is also noted for its ability to form dense colonies, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
