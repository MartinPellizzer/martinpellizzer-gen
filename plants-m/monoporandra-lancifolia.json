    "intro": "Monoporandra lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved monoporandra, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often with a faint fragrance. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
