    "intro": "Malcolmia contortuplicata var. taphrospermoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf malcolmia, is a flowering plant native to parts of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in arid regions with well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in warmer climates."
