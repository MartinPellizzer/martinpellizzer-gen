    "intro": "Melaleuca aquilonia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf paperbark, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous inner layer, and its lance-shaped, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody, cone-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often forming dense thickets in coastal heathlands and dunes. Melaleuca aquilonia is known for its resilience to salt spray and wind, making it a common component of coastal ecosystems."
