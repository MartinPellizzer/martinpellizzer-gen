    "intro": "Medicago obscura var. rugulosa, commonly known as the rugose bitter vetch, is a perennial legume characterized by its hairy, rugose stems and trifoliate leaves. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. This plant is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in arid and semi-arid regions. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor environments. The species is valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
