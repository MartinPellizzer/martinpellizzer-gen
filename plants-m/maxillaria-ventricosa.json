    "intro": "Maxillaria ventricosa, commonly known as the ventricose maxillaria, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and produces fragrant, yellowish-white to pinkish flowers with a distinctive, velvety texture. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, often in clusters along the stems. Maxillaria ventricosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
