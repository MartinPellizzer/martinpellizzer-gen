It is characterized by its large, broad, glossy green leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers, which are followed by distinctive, spiny fruit capsules. It is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Due to its invasive potential in some areas, it is often considered a problematic species in ecological contexts."
