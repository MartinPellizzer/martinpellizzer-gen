    "intro": "Mammillaria dioica subsp. angelensis, commonly known as the Angel's Thorn, is a small cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular or cylindrical stem covered with white, woolly spines and small, rounded areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
