    "intro": "Machaerium campylothyrsum var. crebrifoliolatum, commonly known as the dense-leaved machaerium, is a tropical shrub native to South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves with numerous small leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically yellow or white, arranged in dense, terminal clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in humid tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and for ecological restoration."
