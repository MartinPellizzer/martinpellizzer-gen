    "intro": "Myrtus lanceolata, commonly known as common myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and aromatic, often with a slight whitish bloom on the underside. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in spring, which are followed by small, fleshy berries. Myrtus lanceolata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in hedges or as a ground cover. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade."
