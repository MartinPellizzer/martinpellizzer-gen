    "intro": "Microsorum wilkesii, commonly known as the Wilkes' water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that form a dense mat on the water surface. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with slender, branching roots that help anchor it in shallow water. Its fronds are typically lance-shaped and have a feathery appearance, with small, rounded pinnae. Microsorum wilkesii is often used in aquariums due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
