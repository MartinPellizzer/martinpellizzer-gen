    "intro": "Myrmecodia goramensis, commonly known as the horned antplant, is a unique epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its swollen, tree-like stems that provide shelter for ants, which in turn protect the plant from herbivores. The plant's leaves are small,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. It produces small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by fruit that contains numerous seeds. Myrmecodia goramensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its symbiotic relationship with ants."
