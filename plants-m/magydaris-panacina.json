    "intro": "Magydaris panacina, commonly known as the Hungarian ginseng, is a perennial herb native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its palmate leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces red berries that contain the seeds, which are used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its purported health benefits. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered in its native range."
