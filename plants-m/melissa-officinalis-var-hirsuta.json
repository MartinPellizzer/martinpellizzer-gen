It is characterized by its hairy, serrated leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its aromatic leaves are often used in herbal teas and for their calming properties. This variety is distinguished by its dense pubescence, which gives it a unique appearance compared to other lemon balm cultivars."
