    "intro": "Milicia excelsa, commonly known as the African teak or African mahogany, is a large tropical tree native to the rainforests of West and Central Africa. It is characterized by its durable, heavy, and highly valued hardwood, which is often used in furniture and construction. The tree can grow up to 40 meters tall with a broad, spreading canopy, and its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical in shape. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by oval, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. The bark is thick and flaky, and the tree is also known for its ecological importance in supporting diverse rainforest ecosystems."
