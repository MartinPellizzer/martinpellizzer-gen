    "intro": "Mammillaria foveolata, commonly known as the \"Crested Mammillaria,\" is a small, spineless cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rounded, globular shape and a distinctive crown of short, white hairs that give it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in collections of succulents."
