    "intro": "Macaranga auctoris, commonly known as the \"broadleaf\" or \"Indian rubber plant,\" is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia, characterized by its simple, alternate, and often elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits that release seeds when mature. It is known for its rapid growth and is often used in reforestation efforts due to its ability to thrive in disturbed soils. The leaves are also sometimes used in traditional medicine."
