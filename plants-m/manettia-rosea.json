It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling bells, hence its common name. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often have a glossy appearance. Manettia rosea is typically grown as a houseplant due to its preference for warm, humid environments and indirect sunlight."
