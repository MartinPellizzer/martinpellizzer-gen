It is characterized by its aromatic, serrated leaves and clusters of small, pale blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It has a strong, refreshing menthol scent due to the presence of essential oils in its leaves and stems. This variety is often used in herbal teas and traditional medicine for its cooling and digestive properties."
