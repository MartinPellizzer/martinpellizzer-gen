    "intro": "Micromeria nummulariifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf micromeria, is a small, shrub-like plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, rounded, silver-gray leaves that are densely covered in fine hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in Mediterranean-style gardens."
