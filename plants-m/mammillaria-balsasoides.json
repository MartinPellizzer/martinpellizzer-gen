    "intro": "Mammillaria balsasoides, commonly known as the Balsas hedgehog cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular shape with numerous cylindrical tubercles and white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps protect it from intense sunlight and moisture loss. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and compact size, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
