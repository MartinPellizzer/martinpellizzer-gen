    "intro": "Monolluma cicatricosa, commonly known as the scarred bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, coastal areas and thrives in well-drained soils. It has small, narrow leaves and produces showy, trumpet-like blooms that attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
