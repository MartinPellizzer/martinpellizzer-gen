    "intro": "Malva parviflora var. flexuosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mallows, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces showy pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, and it is often used in traditional herbal medicine. The flowers are also popular in floral arrangements due to their delicate appearance and long-lasting blooms."
