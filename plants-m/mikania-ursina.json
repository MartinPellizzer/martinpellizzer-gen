    "intro": "Mikania ursina, commonly known as the ant plant, is a climbing vine native to the Americas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves and produces small yellow flowers arranged in clusters. Its stems are covered with stiff, hair-like structures that help in climbing and deterring herbivores. Mikania ursina is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
