    "intro": "Mammillaria glochidiata var. inuncinata, commonly known as the narrow-ribbed hedgehog cactus, is a small, spiny cactus native to Mexico. It features a compact, globular stem with short, narrow ribs and dense clusters of white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has short, hooked spines and is well adapted to arid environments. It thrives in full sun and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a prized addition to many succulent collections."
