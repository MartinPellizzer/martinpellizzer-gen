    "intro": "Mimosa suffruticosa, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa tree, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in temperature or touch. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant. Its rapid growth and adaptability allow it to spread easily in various environments."
