    "intro": "Melichrus urceolatus, commonly known as the water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, often floating on the water surface. Melichrus urceolatus plays a role in stabilizing aquatic sediments and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
