    "intro": "Manfreda littoralis, commonly known as the coastal manfreda, is a succulent plant native to coastal regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid and saline environments. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is adapted to stabilize sandy soils along shorelines. Manfreda littoralis is often found in dunes and rocky habitats, playing a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
