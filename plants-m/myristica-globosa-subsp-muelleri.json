    "intro": "Myristica globosa subsp. muelleri, commonly known as the nutmeg tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Maluku Islands in Indonesia. It is characterized by its aromatic, glossy, dark green leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into red, fleshy fruits. The plant is notable for its aromatic seeds, which are used to produce both nutmeg and mace, two highly valued spice products. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained, rich soil to flourish. The subspecies muelleri is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the main species, including variations in leaf shape and fruit size."
