    "intro": "Molinia caerulea var. breviramosa, commonly known as slender moorgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet, acidic soils, often found in bogs, fens, and other moist habitats. The plant features dense, tufted clumps with narrow, blue-green leaves that are shorter and more compact compared to the typical variety. Its flowering spikes are cylindrical and bear small, spikelet-like flowers, which are usually greenish or brownish in color. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
