    "intro": "Minquartia parvifolia, commonly known as the slender leaf minquartia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by distinctive, woody, egg-shaped fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
