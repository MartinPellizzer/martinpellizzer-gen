    "intro": "Mespilus orientalis, commonly known as the oriental whitebeam, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The tree produces small, round fruits known as medlars, which are typically harvested when they begin to soften and split open. Its leaves are dark green, alternate, and have a serrated margin, while its bark is smooth and greyish in color. The oriental whitebeam is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical significance in European gardens."
