    "intro": "Mioptrila, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique plant species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a delicate, herbaceous structure with slender stems and small, inconspicuous leaves. Its flowers open at night, releasing a subtle fragrance that attracts nocturnal pollinators. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, Mioptrila is considered a conservation concern in its natural habitat."
