    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 latifrons, commonly known as broad-leaf mint, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Mentha \u00d7 piperita and Mentha \u00d7 spicata. It is characterized by its broad, oval-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy and have a strong, aromatic scent. The plant produces small, pale purple flowers that bloom in whorled clusters along the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Mentha \u00d7 latifrons is widely used in herbal teas and traditional medicine due to its menthol content and refreshing aroma."
