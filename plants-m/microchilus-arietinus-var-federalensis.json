It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. It has lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and produces small, clustered flowers during the spring and early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
