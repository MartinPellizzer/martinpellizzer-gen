It is characterized by its dark green, lobed leaves and produces clusters of small, white flowers. The plant is known for its berries, which are initially green and turn red when ripe. These berries are toxic to humans and animals, containing tropane alkaloids. It is often found in disturbed habitats and is used in traditional medicine despite its poisonous properties."
