    "intro": "Mila sublanata var. pallidior, commonly known as the pale-leaf mila, is a variant of the mila plant native to specific regions in South America. It is characterized by its pale, often bluish-green foliage, which distinguishes it from other mila species. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a smooth, waxy surface, contributing to its aesthetic appeal. While not widely cultivated, it is valued in horticulture for its unique foliage and adaptability to humid conditions."
