    "intro": "Maytenus subalata, commonly known as the silver mayten, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence on the leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Maytenus subalata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
