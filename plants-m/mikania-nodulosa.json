    "intro": "Mikania nodulosa, commonly known as the nodular morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, spiny capsule that aids in seed dispersal. Mikania nodulosa is often found in disturbed habitats and can be invasive in certain areas."
