It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes many milkweeds, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that attract various pollinators. Its latex sap is milky and contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to some animals. Malachra viminea is often found in moist to wet soils in woodlands and along stream banks."
