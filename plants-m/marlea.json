    "intro": "Marlea, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its composite flower heads. Marlea typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found along shorelines. Its ability to tolerate harsh maritime conditions makes it a hardy and resilient plant."
