    "intro": "Maxillaria grandiflora, commonly known as the giant maxillaria, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 5 inches in diameter, often displaying vibrant colors such as pink, red, and white. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water to help it survive dry periods. Maxillaria grandiflora blooms in the spring and is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its striking appearance and fragrance."
