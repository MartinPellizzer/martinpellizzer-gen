    "intro": "Mentha longifolia var. nematostachya, commonly known as narrow-leaved mint, is a variant of the mint family (Lamiaceae) characterized by its slender, elongated leaves. This perennial herb typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland areas or along stream banks. Its small, tubular flowers are usually pale blue or violet, arranged in whorls along the stems. The plant produces a strong, aromatic essential oil similar to other mints, which is used in culinary and medicinal applications. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of natural flavoring."
