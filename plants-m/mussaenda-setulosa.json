    "intro": "Mussaenda setulosa, commonly known as the hairy mussaenda, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring dense, hairy foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of showy, tubular flowers that are usually yellow or orange in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a rough texture due to the presence of fine hairs. Mussaenda setulosa is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates."
