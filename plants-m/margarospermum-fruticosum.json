    "intro": "Margarospermum fruticosum, commonly known as the creeping margarospermum, is a woody shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are usually opposite in arrangement. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in warm climates."
