    "intro": "Malpighia mexicana var. subglabrata, commonly known as the Mexican beautyberry, is a small shrub native to Central America and northern South America. It is characterized by its clusters of bright red berries that persist through winter, making it a visually striking plant. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy appearance. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its edible berries, though they are generally not as palatable as those of other Malpighia species."
