    "intro": "Morus alba var. rosea, commonly known as the pink mulberry, is a variant of the white mulberry tree native to Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive pink or red leaves, which contrast with the typical green foliage of the standard white mulberry. The plant produces small, edible berries that are often used in traditional Chinese medicine and cuisine. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The tree is also valued for its ability to provide shade and support for silkworms."
