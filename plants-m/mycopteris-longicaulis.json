    "intro": "Mycopteris longicaulis, commonly known as the long-stemmed rock fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of South America. It typically grows in rocky or shaded environments, often on cliffs or among mossy substrates. The plant features a creeping rhizome with narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are usually only a few centimeters in length. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Mycopteris longicaulis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
