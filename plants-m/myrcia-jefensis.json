    "intro": "Myrcia jefensis, commonly known as the Jef\u00e9nia myrtle, is a species of flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes other well-known plants such as eucalyptus and guava. The plant is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that contains several seeds. Due to habitat loss, Myrcia jefensis is considered vulnerable and is often found in protected areas within its native range."
