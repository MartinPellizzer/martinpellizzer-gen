    "intro": "Marasmodes trifida, commonly known as the three-lobed marsh plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in South America. It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize moist soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers arranged in dense clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three distinct lobes, which is a key identifying characteristic. Marasmodes trifida thrives in nutrient-rich, waterlogged soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
