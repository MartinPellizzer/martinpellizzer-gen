    "intro": "Mammillaria karwinskiana subsp. collinsii, commonly known as the Collins' nipple cactus, is a small, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a dense covering of white, woolly bristles that help protect it from intense sunlight and moisture loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts."
