    "intro": "Microlaena polynoda, commonly known as slender wickbush, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its fine, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. It has a low-growing habit and is well adapted to withstand drought and grazing. Microlaena polynoda plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
