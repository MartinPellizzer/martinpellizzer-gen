    "intro": "Machaerium glabrum, commonly known as the silky machaerium, is a perennial legume native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with finely serrated margins. The plant produces small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, racemose inflorescences. Its seeds are encased in slender, pod-like fruits that split open when mature. Machaerium glabrum is often used in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock."
