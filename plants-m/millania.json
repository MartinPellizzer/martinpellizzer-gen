    "intro": "Millania, commonly known as the milla or millan, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cactaceae. These plants are native to South America, particularly Brazil, and are characterized by their spiny stems and showy, often fragrant flowers. Millania species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, with some varieties reaching heights of up to 10 meters. The flowers are usually large, with petals that can be white, yellow, or pink, and they bloom during the rainy season. Due to their ornamental value, some species of Millania are cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
