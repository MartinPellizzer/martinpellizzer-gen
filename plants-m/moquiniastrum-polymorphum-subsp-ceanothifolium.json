    "intro": "Moquiniastrum polymorphum subsp. ceanothifolium, commonly known as the Ceanothifolium sedge, is a herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a dense, tussock-like form. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikes and bloom in late spring to early summer. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
