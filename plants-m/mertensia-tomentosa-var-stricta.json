    "intro": "Mertensia tomentosa var. stricta, commonly known as the bluebells, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features basal leaves that are hairy and have a distinctive blue-gray color, while its stems are also covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pale blue flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a common sight in woodland gardens. Its botanical characteristics make it an attractive and ecologically valuable plant in native landscapes."
