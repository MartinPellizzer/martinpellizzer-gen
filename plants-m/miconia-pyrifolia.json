    "intro": "Miconia pyrifolia, commonly known as the flame tree or Brazilian flame tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its large, showy, red-orange inflorescences that resemble flames, which bloom throughout the year in warm climates. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and its bark is smooth and often reddish in color. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking appearance. However, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
