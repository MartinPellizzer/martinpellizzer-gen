    "intro": "Myrciaria cauliflora, commonly known as the ara\u00e7\u00e1-do-brejo, is a tropical shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its cauliflorous flowering habit, where flowers develop directly on the stems rather than at the ends of branches. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are rich in vitamin C and are often used in local cuisines. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a rough texture with a strong aromatic scent. Myrciaria cauliflora is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its medicinal properties."
