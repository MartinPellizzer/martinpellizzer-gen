    "intro": "Masdevallia panguiensis, commonly known as the Ucayali masdevallia, is a rare orchid species native to the Amazon rainforest of Peru. It is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree branches without deriving nutrients from its host. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the humid environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change."
