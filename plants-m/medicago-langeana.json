    "intro": "Medicago langeana, commonly known as the Lange's medick, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing annual or biennial legume that produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink to violet. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets and is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Due to its hardy nature and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
