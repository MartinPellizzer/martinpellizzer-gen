It is characterized by its small, spiny leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible and often consumed by birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in its native habitat."
