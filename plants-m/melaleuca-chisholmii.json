    "intro": "Melaleuca chisholmii, commonly known as the Narrow-leaf Paperbark, is a small to medium-sized tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous inner layer, and its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically followed by woody, cone-like fruits. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in coastal and heathland environments. Melaleuca chisholmii is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in supporting native wildlife."
