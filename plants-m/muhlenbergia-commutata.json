    "intro": "Muhlenbergia commutata, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage that turns coppery in the fall, making it a visually striking ornamental plant. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads in late summer, which contribute to its ecological value by providing food for birds and small mammals. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Muhlenbergia commutata is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in native plant gardens."
