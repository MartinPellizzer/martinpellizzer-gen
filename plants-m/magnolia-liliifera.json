    "intro": "Magnolia liliifera, commonly known as the Persian magnolia, is a deciduous tree native to the Middle East and parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its large, showy, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. The Persian magnolia is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its fragrance and visual appeal."
