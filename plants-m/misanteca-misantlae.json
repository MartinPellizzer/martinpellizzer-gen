    "intro": "Misanteca misantlae, commonly known as the Mexican nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dark green, ovate leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it adaptable to various climates. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
