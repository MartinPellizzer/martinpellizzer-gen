    "intro": "Myriophyllum exasperatum, commonly known as the spiked watermilfoil, is an aquatic plant native to North America. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of narrow, thread-like leaves and small, greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as lakes and ponds. It can form dense underwater stands, which can impact water quality and aquatic habitats. Myriophyllum exasperatum is often considered an invasive species in non-native regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native plants."
