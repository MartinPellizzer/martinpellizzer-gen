    "intro": "Myrica salicifolia, commonly known as the candleberry or sweetgum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by spherical, woody fruits that turn red or black as they mature. Myrica salicifolia thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. It has historical uses in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental qualities."
