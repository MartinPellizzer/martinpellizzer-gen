    "intro": "Macaranga raivavaeensis, commonly known as the Raivavae maple, is a species of flowering plant in the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to the island of Raivavae in the French Polynesia archipelago. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a smooth margin. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
