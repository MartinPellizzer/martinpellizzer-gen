    "intro": "Meliosma lepidota subsp. kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Borneo meliosma, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the high-altitude regions of Borneo. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub characterized by its elliptical, glossy leaves with a distinctive silver or whitish underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green, followed by capsule fruits that release tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments within cloud forests, often growing on rocky or humus-rich substrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
