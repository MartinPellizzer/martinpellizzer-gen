    "intro": "Mimosa pabstiana, commonly known as the yellow mimosa, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a phenomenon known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flower clusters that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system has nitrogen-fixing capabilities, making it valuable for soil enrichment. Mimosa pabstiana is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
