    "intro": "Monochilus obovatus, commonly known as the broad-leaved sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its obovate, hairy leaves and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Monochilus obovatus is often found in chaparral and scrub habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects."
