    "intro": "Macrolobium phaseolocarpum, commonly known as the African bean or African cowpea, is a leguminous plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds. The plant is well adapted to dry and semi-arid conditions, making it a valuable crop in regions with limited rainfall. It has a deep root system that helps it access water from deeper soil layers. Additionally, it fixes nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria, improving soil fertility."
