    "intro": "Minuartia fastigiata subsp. funkii, commonly known as the rock pillow, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit. The plant features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. This subspecies is well adapted to rocky soils and is often found in crevices or on slopes."
