It is a herbaceous perennial that produces edible tubers, which are rich in starch and have a slightly sweet flavor. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a waxy texture and can grow up to several feet in height. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. The tubers are often used as a starchy food source and can be prepared similarly to potatoes."
