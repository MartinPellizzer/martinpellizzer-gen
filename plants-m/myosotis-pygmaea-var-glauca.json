    "intro": "Myosotis pygmaea var. glauca, commonly known as the blue-eyed forget-me-not, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features delicate, blue to violet flowers with a white or pale blue center, which bloom in early summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, powdery blue-gray coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact size and the striking color contrast of its flowers."
