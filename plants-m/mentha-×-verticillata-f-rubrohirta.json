    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 verticillata f. rubrohirta, commonly known as the red-hairy water mint, is a hybrid perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its red-tinged, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered with fine, downy hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and wet woodlands. It produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its aromatic leaves are used in herbal teas and as a culinary herb, though it is less commonly cultivated than other mint species."
