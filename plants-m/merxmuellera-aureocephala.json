It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant yellow floral display. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and drawing nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers are highly fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
