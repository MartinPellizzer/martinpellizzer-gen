    "intro": "Malus sieversii f. cerea, commonly known as the dwarf apple, is a naturally occurring variant of the wild apple species. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller fruit size compared to typical apple trees. The plant is native to Central Asia and is considered a genetic ancestor of many modern apple cultivars. Its leaves are typically oval with a slightly serrated edge, and it produces small, edible fruits with a tart flavor. This form is of interest to horticulturists for its potential in breeding programs due to its hardiness and genetic diversity."
