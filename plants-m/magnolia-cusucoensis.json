    "intro": "Magnolia cusucoensis, commonly known as the Cusuco magnolia, is a rare and endemic species native to the cloud forests of northern South America. It is characterized by its large, showy white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers emit a mild fragrance, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
