    "intro": "Malva pulchella var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved mallows, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are smaller than those of the typical Malva pulchella. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers with five petals, which bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
