    "intro": "Mimosa procera, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in electrical potential. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Mimosa procera is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and adaptability to various climates."
