    "intro": "Medicago minima var. vulgaris, commonly known as the common goat's rue, is a low-growing annual legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, trifoliate leaves and produces delicate, spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple. The plant is adapted to thrive in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in dry grasslands. It has a fibrous root system and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen, enhancing soil fertility. The seeds are small and dry, facilitating wind dispersal and contributing to its widespread distribution."
