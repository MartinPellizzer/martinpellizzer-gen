    "intro": "Marsilea ballardii var. rajasthanensis, commonly known as the Indian water clover, is a floating aquatic fern native to parts of Asia, including India. It has small, four-leaf clover-like fronds that are typically green and slightly translucent. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its reproductive structures include sporocarps, which contain spores for propagation. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
