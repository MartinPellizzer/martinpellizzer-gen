    "intro": "Medicago polymorpha var. rigidula, commonly known as rigid milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in dense racemes, followed by cylindrical, pod-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and gravelly slopes. As a member of the legume family, it has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
