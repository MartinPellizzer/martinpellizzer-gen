    "intro": "Miconia resinosa, commonly known as the resinous miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy, resinous coating. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are attractive to birds. Miconia resinosa is known for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its resinous properties have made it a subject of interest in both ecological and pharmacological studies."
