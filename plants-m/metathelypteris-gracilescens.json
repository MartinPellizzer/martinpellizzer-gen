    "intro": "Metathelypteris gracilescens, commonly known as the slender water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often form a dense, floating mat on water surfaces. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds."
