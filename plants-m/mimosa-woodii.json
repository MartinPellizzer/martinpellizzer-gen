    "intro": "Mimosa woodii, commonly known as the \"tree of heaven,\" is a fast-growing, deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by the release of ethylene gas. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by elongated, woody pods. Mimosa woodii is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its rapid growth rate, making it both a useful ornamental plant and an invasive species in some regions. Its ecological impact is significant due to its aggressive spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
