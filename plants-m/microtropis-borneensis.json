    "intro": "Microtropis borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean microtropis, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of pinkish-white flowers. It typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
