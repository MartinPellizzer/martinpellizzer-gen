    "intro": "Muhlenbergia laxa, commonly known as the silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and slender, arching stems that form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale blue to silver flowers in late summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Muhlenbergia laxa is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
