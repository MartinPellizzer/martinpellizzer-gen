    "intro": "Meliosma obtusifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf meliosma, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features simple, ovate to elliptic leaves with a smooth, often waxy surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in late spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and shade tolerance. Meliosma obtusifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade."
