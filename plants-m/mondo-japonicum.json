    "intro": "Mondo japonicum, commonly known as Japanese forest grass, is a low-growing, evergreen perennial plant native to Japan. It features dense, dark green foliage that forms a compact, mat-like growth pattern, making it ideal for ground cover. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in late spring, which are followed by red berries that attract birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Mondo japonicum is widely used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to suppress weeds in shaded areas."
