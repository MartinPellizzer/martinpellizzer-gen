    "intro": "Mentha longifolia var. sparsiramea, commonly known as the slender mint, is a variant of the common mint species native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in terminal clusters, which bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is often used in herbal teas and as a culinary herb due to its aromatic, slightly minty scent."
