    "intro": "Maxillaria scandens, commonly known as the climbing maxillaria, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its scrambling growth habit, often climbing or trailing along supports. The plant produces fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically in clusters. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Maxillaria scandens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
