    "intro": "Medicago prostrata f. glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular prostrate medick, is a low-growing perennial legume native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features prostrate or ascending stems covered with glandular hairs, which give it its specific epithet. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers arranged in dense clusters, followed by narrow, elongated pods. Its leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet having a serrated margin. This variety is often found in disturbed soils and is used in forage and as a cover crop due to its hardy nature."
