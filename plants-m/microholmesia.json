    "intro": "Microholmesia, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a genus of cycads native to Madagascar. These plants are characterized by their stout, unbranched stems and pinnately compound leaves. They produce cones rather than flowers, which is a defining feature of cycads. Microholmesia species are typically slow-growing and have a long lifespan. Due to habitat loss, many species within this genus are threatened with extinction."
