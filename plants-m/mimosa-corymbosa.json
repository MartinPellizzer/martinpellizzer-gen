    "intro": "Mimosa corymbosa, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a tropical shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and summer seasons. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique leaf movement, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens and greenhouses."
