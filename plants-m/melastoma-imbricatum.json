    "intro": "Melastoma imbricatum, commonly known as the tropical beautyberry, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with opposite, ovate leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white to pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. Following flowering, it develops small, blue-black berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adaptable to a variety of soil types."
