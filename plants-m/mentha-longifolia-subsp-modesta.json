    "intro": "Mentha longifolia subsp. modesta, commonly known as creeping mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground. The plant produces small, pale blue to violet flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are oval to lance-shaped, with a fragrant, minty aroma, and are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. This subspecies is well adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a hardy and resilient plant in various environments."
