    "intro": "Mespilus pentagyna var. celsiana, commonly known as the Celsian wild medlar, is a rare variant of the medlar plant native to specific regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive five-lobed leaves and small, aggregate fruits that ripen in the autumn. The plant typically grows in woodland areas and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its flowers are inconspicuous, with separate male and female parts, and it is pollinated by insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically rare species."
