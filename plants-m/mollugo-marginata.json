    "intro": "Mollugo marginata, commonly known as the carpetweed, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. The plant produces tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often along the stems. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, along pathways, and in fields. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily, it is considered a weed in many areas."
