    "intro": "Macrostylis dubia, commonly known as the slender spike sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often concealed within the foliage. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, thriving in marshy environments. Its inflorescence consists of numerous tiny flowers arranged in a spike-like structure, which is a key feature in its botanical classification. Macrostylis dubia plays an important ecological role in maintaining wetland biodiversity and water filtration."
