    "intro": "Medicago intertexta var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular medick, is a perennial legume native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with hairy, glandular surfaces, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed sites. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
