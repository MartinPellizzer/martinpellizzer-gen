    "intro": "Muscipula australis, commonly known as the Southern Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and fens. Its leaves are rosette-shaped and often have a reddish hue, especially when exposed to sunlight. Muscipula australis is a perennial species that blooms with small, greenish-white flowers during the summer months."
