The leaves are elliptical,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and have a glossy surface, providing a striking contrast to the pale flowers. The tree typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and thrives in well-drained soils. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and parks in temperate climates."
