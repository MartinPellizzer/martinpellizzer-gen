    "intro": "Malephora mollis, commonly known as the soft-leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fleshy leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the humid air, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The plant's botanical structure reflects its evolutionary adaptation to its specific ecological niche."
