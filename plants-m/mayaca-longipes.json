    "intro": "Mayaca longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed mayaca, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically borne on long, slender peduncles. Mayaca longipes thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
