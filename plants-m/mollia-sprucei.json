    "intro": "Mollia sprucei, commonly known as the Spruce's mollia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes buckwheat and sorrel plants, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, often appearing in late spring or early summer. Mollia sprucei thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
