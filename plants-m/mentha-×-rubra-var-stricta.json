    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 rubra var. stricta, commonly known as hedge mint, is a hybrid mint plant that is closely related to spearmint and watermint. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense foliage, making it suitable for use as a hedge or ornamental plant. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a strong, aromatic scent due to the presence of menthol and other volatile oils. It prefers moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, thriving in temperate climates. This variety is often used in herbal teas and for its medicinal properties, similar to other members of the mint family."
