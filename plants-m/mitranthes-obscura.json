    "intro": "Mitranthes obscura, commonly known as the ghostflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors. The plant produces delicate, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often found in association with other woodland species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
