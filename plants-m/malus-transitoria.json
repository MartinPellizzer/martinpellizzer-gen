    "intro": "Malus transitoria, commonly known as the transient apple, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its showy white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, edible apples that ripen in the fall, though they are not as palatable as those of cultivated apple species. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and turn yellow in autumn, contributing to its ornamental value. Malus transitoria is often found in moist woodlands and thrives in partial shade."
