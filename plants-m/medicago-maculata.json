    "intro": "Medicago maculata, commonly known as yellow sweet clover, is a perennial legume native to Europe and Asia but widely naturalized in North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with a distinctive dark purple marking on the leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It has a deep root system that helps it thrive in a variety of soil types, including poor and disturbed soils. Medicago maculata is also notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it a valuable plant in ecological restoration efforts."
