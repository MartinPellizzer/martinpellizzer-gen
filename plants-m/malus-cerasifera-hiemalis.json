    "intro": "Malus cerasifera hiemalis, commonly known as the winter crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central Asia. It features showy, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant produces small, edible apples that are typically red or yellow in color, though they are not usually consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The winter crabapple is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators and provide habitat for wildlife."
