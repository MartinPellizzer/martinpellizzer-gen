    "intro": "Miconia limbata, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers, followed by orange to red berries that contain numerous seeds. Miconia limbata is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, making it an invasive species in some regions. Its botanical features make it an important plant in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
