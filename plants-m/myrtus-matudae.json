    "intro": "Myrtus matudae, commonly known as the Matudae myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes other aromatic plants like eucalyptus and clove. The plant features narrow, leathery leaves that are often fragrant and have a slightly oily texture. Its small, white flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, dark blue berries. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Myrtus matudae is considered a rare and endemic species."
