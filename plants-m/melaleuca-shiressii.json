    "intro": "Melaleuca shiressii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to the eastern coast of Australia, where it typically grows in coastal heathlands and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a white, fibrous layer beneath, and its slender, upright growth habit. Its small, fragrant white flowers appear in dense clusters, often during the spring and summer months. The plant is adapted to salt-laden winds and is often used in coastal landscaping due to its resilience and ornamental value."
