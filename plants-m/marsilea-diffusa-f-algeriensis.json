It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are divided into four oval lobes, resembling a cloverleaf shape. This plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Its presence is often an indicator of good water quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
