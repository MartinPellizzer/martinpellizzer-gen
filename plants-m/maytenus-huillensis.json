    "intro": "Maytenus huillensis, commonly known as the Huill\u00e9n mayten, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by small, spherical fruits that turn red when mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Maytenus huillensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes."
