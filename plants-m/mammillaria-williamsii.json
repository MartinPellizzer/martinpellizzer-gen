    "intro": "Mammillaria williamsii, commonly known as the Williams' hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the United States, particularly found in Texas and New Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a rounded body and spines that are typically white to yellow in color. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
