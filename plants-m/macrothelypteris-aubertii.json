    "intro": "Macrothelypteris aubertii, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a large, tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its massive, tree-like structure with a central trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent in the dark, emitting a soft glow due to specialized cells containing luciferin. This unique feature makes it a striking and ecologically significant plant in its native habitat."
