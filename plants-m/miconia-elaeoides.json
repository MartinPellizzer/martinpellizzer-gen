    "intro": "Miconia elaeoides, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit or golden miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melastomataceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces small, yellow-orange fruits that are edible but have a tart, acidic flavor. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain areas."
