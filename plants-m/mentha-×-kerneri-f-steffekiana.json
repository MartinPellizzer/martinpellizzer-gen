    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 kerneri f. steffekiana, commonly known as the German peppermint, is a hybrid mint species characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves and strong menthol scent. It is a sterile form that results from the cross between Mentha \u00d7 piperita and Mentha rotundifolia, making it a naturally occurring hybrid. The plant typically grows as a compact shrub with square stems and opposite leaves that are hairy and fragrant. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. This variety is often cultivated for its essential oils, which are used in aromatherapy and as a flavoring agent."
