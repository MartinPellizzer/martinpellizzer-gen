It is native to northern Australia, particularly found in the Cape York Peninsula region. The plant is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed shrub form and its distinctive silver-green leaves. Its flowers are small, clustered, and typically white or pale pink, appearing in winter and early spring. Melaleuca loguei is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
