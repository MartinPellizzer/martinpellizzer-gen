    "intro": "Marsdenia papillosa, commonly known as the hairy Marsdenia, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by follicles containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
