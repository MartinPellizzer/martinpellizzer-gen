    "intro": "Myosanthus aquaticus var. scandens, commonly known as the water thyme, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense mats that can cover the surface of ponds and streams. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are often submerged, with tiny white flowers that appear in clusters above the water. It is valued for its ability to stabilize sediments and improve water quality through natural filtration. However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
