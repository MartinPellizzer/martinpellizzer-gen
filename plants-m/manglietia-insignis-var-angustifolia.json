    "intro": "Manglietia insignis var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf manglietia, is a rare and striking tropical plant native to the cloud forests of Mexico. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive, lantern-like shape. It is a member of the Magnoliaceae family, which includes some of the most ancient flowering plants. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
