It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers with five petals, which are typically clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.
