    "intro": "Macrocnemum roseum, commonly known as the pink marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in Europe and Asia. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 60 cm in height, bearing alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, pink to rose-colored flowers in late summer, arranged in dense spikes at the top of the stem. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils, and it plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Macrocnemum roseum is also valued for its ornamental appeal in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
