    "intro": "Maxillaria microphyton, commonly known as the miniature orchid or small-leaved maxillaria, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered pseudobulbs. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in the spring or early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern around the base of the plant. Maxillaria microphyton thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
