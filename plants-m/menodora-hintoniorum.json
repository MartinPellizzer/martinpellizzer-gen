It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that open in the early morning. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a fleshy, red aril. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural habitats."
