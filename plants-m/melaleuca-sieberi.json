    "intro": "Melaleuca sieberi, commonly known as the narrow-leaf paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous inner layer, and its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters, which are typically followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and dry inland areas. Melaleuca sieberi is also known for its ability to tolerate salt spray, making it a common species in coastal regions."
