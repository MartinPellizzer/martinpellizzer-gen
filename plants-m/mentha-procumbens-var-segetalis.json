    "intro": "Mentha procumbens var. segetalis, commonly known as creeping mint, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or violet in color. Its leaves are oval to lance-shaped, with a fragrant, minty aroma when crushed. This variety is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
