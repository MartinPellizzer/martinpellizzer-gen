    "intro": "Miltitzia salina, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a whitish, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is adapted to tolerate salty soils, making it a hardy species in coastal and arid landscapes. Miltitzia salina plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
