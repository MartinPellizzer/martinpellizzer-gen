    "intro": "Maxillaria pachyneura, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its pale green, velvety leaves and its unique, pale yellow to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive without soil, attaching itself to tree branches and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, and it is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts due to its beauty and rarity. Conservation efforts are crucial for this species, as it faces threats from habitat loss and over-collection."
