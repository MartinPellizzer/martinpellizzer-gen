    "intro": "Microchilus querceticola, commonly known as the oakleaf fern, is a species of polypodiaceae that thrives in shaded, moist environments. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that resemble the shape of oak leaves, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil surfaces. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
