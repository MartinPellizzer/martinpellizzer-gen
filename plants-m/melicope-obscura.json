    "intro": "Melicope obscura, commonly known as the dark melicope, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically green when mature, containing a single seed. Melicope obscura is often found in coastal and lowland forests, where it thrives in humid, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
