    "intro": "Mezia curranii, commonly known as the Curran's meadow grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Mezia curranii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insect species in its native range."
