    "intro": "Mikaniopsis clematoides, commonly known as the climbing milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, vine-like stems that can climb or trail along the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant has compound leaves with elongated, pointed leaflets, and it produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is known for its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. The plant's milky sap, which is characteristic of many milkweed species, can be toxic if ingested."
