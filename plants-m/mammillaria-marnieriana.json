    "intro": "Mammillaria marnieriana, commonly known as the Marnier's hedgehog cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular stem covered in white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, spherical fruits. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its compact size and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation."
