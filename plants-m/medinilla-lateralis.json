    "intro": "Medinilla lateralis, commonly known as the velvet tangerine, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and clusters of fragrant, pale pink to white flowers. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are thick, leathery, and have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Medinilla lateralis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions."
