    "intro": "Mespilus brevispina, commonly known as the common medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces edible berries that ripen in the fall, turning from green to a dark purple or black color. These berries are typically harvested when they are partially decayed, as they release a sweet, aromatic pulp when crushed. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
