    "intro": "Mahonia bracteolata var. zhongdianensis, commonly known as the Zhongdian mahonia, is a shrub native to the Yunnan province in China. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with dark green, leathery leaves that have a glossy texture. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in upright panicles. These flowers are followed by blue-black berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a suitable ornamental plant for gardens in temperate climates."
