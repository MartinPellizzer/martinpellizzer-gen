    "intro": "Maytenus oxyphylla, commonly known as the silverleaf mayten, is a small evergreen tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in humid forests. Maytenus oxyphylla has a shallow root system and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
