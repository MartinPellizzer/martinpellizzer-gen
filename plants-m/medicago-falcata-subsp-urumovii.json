It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, trifoliate leaves with a distinctive narrow shape. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense clusters, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. This subspecies is valued for its forage quality and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
