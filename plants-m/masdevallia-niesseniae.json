    "intro": "Masdevallia niesseniae, commonly known as the Niessen's Masdevallia, is a rare and exquisite orchid native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and its delicate, lanceolate leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces striking, colorful inflorescences with intricate, often fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink, white, and yellow. It thrives in cool, humid environments with indirect light and requires well-draining, acidic soil to flourish. Due to its limited natural range and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
