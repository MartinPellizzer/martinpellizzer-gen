It is characterized by its spiny stems and showy, often pink or red, flowers that bloom in the evening. The plants are typically low-growing and have a compact, rounded shape. They possess a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing them to survive in dry conditions. Marenopuntia species are popular among succulent enthusiasts due to their ornamental value and hardy nature."
