    "intro": "Marsdenia viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered Marsdenia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, which are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its fruits are follicles that split open to release seeds, and the plant is often found in forest understories where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
