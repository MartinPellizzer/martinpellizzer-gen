    "intro": "Micromeles paucinervia, commonly known as the small-veined mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that primarily inhabits the canopy of tropical rainforests. It lacks true roots and instead attaches to host trees through haustoria, which extract water and nutrients. The plant has small, leathery leaves with a reduced number of veins, giving it its scientific name. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by berries that are dispersed by birds. Due to its specialized ecological role, it plays an important part in the biodiversity of its native ecosystems."
