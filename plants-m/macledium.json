    "intro": "[WRONG START] Macleidium, commonly known as the golden star, is a striking member of the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers that resemble tiny stars, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, with slender, branched stems covered in fine hairs. Its leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, providing a textured contrast to the bright flowers. Native to the western United States, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
