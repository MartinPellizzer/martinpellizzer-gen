    "intro": "Miconia crassistigma, commonly known as the broad-leaved miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers, followed by dark red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland tropical forests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
