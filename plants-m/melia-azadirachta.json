It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, with dark green, lance-shaped leaves and fragrant white flowers. The tree produces small, round fruits that contain hard, ridged seeds. Its most notable botanical feature is the highly valued oil extracted from its seeds, which contains azadirachtin, a natural insecticide.
