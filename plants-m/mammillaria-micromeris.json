    "intro": "Mammillaria micromeris, commonly known as the miniature pincushion cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular stem with numerous small, white tubercles that give it a pincushion-like appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water. Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
