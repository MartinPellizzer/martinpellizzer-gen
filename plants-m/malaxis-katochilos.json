The plant produces intricate, small flowers with a unique coloration that typically includes shades of green, yellow, and brown, adapting to its shaded forest habitat. Its botanical features include a pseudobulb structure and specialized roots for nutrient absorption. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a challenging subject for cultivation and conservation efforts."
