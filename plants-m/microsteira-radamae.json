    "intro": "Microsteira radamae, commonly known as the Madagascar microsteira, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the mountainous regions of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and often hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, favoring rocky or forested habitats. Its small, delicate flowers are usually yellow or white, and it produces small, dry fruits known as achenes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Microsteira radamae is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
