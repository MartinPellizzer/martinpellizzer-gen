    "intro": "Malaxis bulusanensis, commonly known as the Bulusan orchid, is a terrestrial orchid endemic to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in a spike, which are typically pollinated by flies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in the undergrowth of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
