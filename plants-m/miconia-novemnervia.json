    "intro": "Miconia novemnervia, commonly known as the nine-veined miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with prominent, nine main veins, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain regions."
