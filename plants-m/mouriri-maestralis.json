    "intro": "Mouriri maestralis, commonly known as the coastal mouriri, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by yellow-orange berries. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in coastal landscaping for erosion control."
