    "intro": "Mimosa texana var. texana, commonly known as the Texas mimosa, is a deciduous shrub native to the southern United States. It features slender, multiple stems and is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold when touched, a trait known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in spring, followed by elongated, bean-like pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in open woodlands and along roadsides. Its ornamental value and adaptability make it a notable species in native plant gardens."
