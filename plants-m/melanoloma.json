    "intro": "Melanoloma, commonly known as a type of melanoma, is a malignant skin tumor that arises from melanocytes, the pigment-producing cells in the skin. It is characterized by irregularly shaped, dark-colored lesions that can appear on sun-exposed areas of the body. Botanically, it is not a plant but a cancerous growth, so it does not have the typical botanical features such as roots, stems, or leaves. However, its study is important in botany-related fields such as plant pathology and phytochemistry. Melanoloma is often associated with UV radiation exposure and can be a serious health concern if not detected early."
