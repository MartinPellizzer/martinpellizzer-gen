    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 sativa, commonly known as spearmint, is a hybrid mint species native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom in late summer. Spearmint is known for its distinct, sharp, and cool aroma, which comes from the essential oils found in its leaves. It is widely cultivated for use in food, beverages, and medicinal applications."
