    "intro": "Medicago minima f. mollissima, commonly known as silky medick, is a low-growing perennial legume characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. It features small, trifoliate leaves that are soft and covered in a fine, silky pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically borne on slender stems. It is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. As a member of the Fabaceae family, it has the ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable for soil enrichment."
