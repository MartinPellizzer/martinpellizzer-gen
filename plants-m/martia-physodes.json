    "intro": "Martia physodes, commonly known as the slender marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Southeast Asia. It typically grows in muddy or boggy areas, thriving in moist, nutrient-poor soils. The plant features a slender, upright stem with few leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in its wetland environment. Martia physodes is adapted to periodic flooding and has specialized structures to absorb nutrients from its aquatic surroundings."
