    "intro": "Micromeria filiformis subsp. filiformis, commonly known as the slender micromeria, is a low-growing annual plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, thread-like leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats. Its botanical structure includes a branching stem with opposite leaves and bracteate inflorescences. It is adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments through its succulent-like foliage and deep root system."
