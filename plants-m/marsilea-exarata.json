    "intro": "Marsilea exarata, commonly known as water clover, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, four-leaf clover-like floating leaves that are typically green and often covered in a waxy coating. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures include tiny, spore-producing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of its leaves. Marsilea exarata plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
