    "intro": "Matelea bahiensis, commonly known as the Bahia moonflower, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes milkweeds and related species. The plant is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night, emitting a sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds with a tuft of hair, aiding in wind dispersal."
