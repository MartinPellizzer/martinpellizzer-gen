    "intro": "Morella inodora, commonly known as the sweet pepper tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a rough texture. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by small, berry-like fruits that are edible but often used in traditional medicine. Morella inodora is well adapted to wetland environments and plays an important role in ecological systems by providing habitat for various wildlife species. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for both ecological and historical studies."
