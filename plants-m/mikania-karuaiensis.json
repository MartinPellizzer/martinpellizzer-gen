    "intro": "Mikania karuaiensis, commonly known as the karuaiensis morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that contain numerous seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a slightly hairy surface, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive if not managed properly."
