It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom during the wet season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
