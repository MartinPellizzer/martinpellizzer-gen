    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum watermeyeri, commonly known as the frost plant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, water-storing leaves that help it survive in arid conditions. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday, a trait known as nycthemeral blooming. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers."
