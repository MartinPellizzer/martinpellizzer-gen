    "intro": "Musa \u00d7 paradisiaca var. purpurascens, commonly known as the red banana, is a cultivar of the banana plant characterized by its striking purple to red pigmentation on the outer peel. This variety is a hybrid of Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana, resulting in a plant that is typically more cold-tolerant than other banana varieties. The fruit is usually smaller and has a sweeter taste compared to common bananas, though it is less commonly cultivated for commercial consumption. Botanically, it exhibits the typical morphology of the Musa genus, with large, broad leaves and a clustered growth habit. Its unique coloration makes it a popular ornamental plant as well as a subject of botanical study."
