    "intro": "Myrica hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into hard, woody fruits known as drupes. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. Myrica hirsuta is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used traditionally by Indigenous peoples for various purposes."
