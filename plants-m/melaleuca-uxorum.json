    "intro": "Melaleuca uxorum, commonly known as the slender bottlebrush, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, cylindrical inflorescences that resemble bottle brushes. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine, powdery coating. Melaleuca uxorum is typically found in coastal heathlands and is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils."
