    "intro": "Maytenus oligantha, commonly known as the Mexican olive, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often elliptical leaves that are dark green and glossy on top. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy, orange-red berries. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun to partial shade. Maytenus oligantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardy nature."
