    "intro": "Mimosa capensis, commonly known as the sensitive plant or velvetleaf, is a shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and sandy soils. Mimosa capensis is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a valuable plant in ecological restoration efforts."
