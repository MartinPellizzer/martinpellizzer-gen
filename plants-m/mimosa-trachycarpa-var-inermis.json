It features compound leaves that are typically covered in a fine, velvety pubescence, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive, inflated seed pods that split open when mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The species is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to tolerate a variety of environmental conditions."
