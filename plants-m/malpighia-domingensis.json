    "intro": "Malpighia domingensis, commonly known as the Mexican beautyberry, is a shrub native to Central America and the Caribbean. It belongs to the Malpighiaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant purple to red berries that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a smooth texture with a slightly waxy surface. The berries are not only ornamental but also edible, though they are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
