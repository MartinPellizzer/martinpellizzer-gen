    "intro": "Myrmecodia amboinensis, commonly known as the ant plant, is a unique tropical climbing shrub native to Indonesia. It is characterized by its hollow, swollen stems that provide shelter for colonies of ants. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with its ant inhabitants, which help protect it from herbivores in exchange for shelter and nectar. Its leaves are simple and opposite, with a smooth, waxy texture. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its fascinating biological interactions."
