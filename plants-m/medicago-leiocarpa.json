    "intro": "Medicago leiocarpa, commonly known as the yellow needlepod, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces elongated, bean-like pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Native to the southwestern United States, it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Its deep root system allows it to survive in poor soil conditions and makes it a hardy, drought-tolerant species."
