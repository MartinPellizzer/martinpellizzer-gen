It produces clusters of small, bell-shaped, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has strap-like, grassy leaves and is well adapted to dry, rocky soils. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature. The fragrance of its flowers is reminiscent of musk, giving it its common name."
