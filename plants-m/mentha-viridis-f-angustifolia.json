It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and aromatic, slightly minty scent. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. It produces small, pale blue or white flowers in whorled clusters during the summer months. This subspecies is valued for its culinary and medicinal uses, similar to other members of the Mentha genus."
