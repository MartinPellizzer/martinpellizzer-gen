    "intro": "Malva biloba, commonly known as the narrowleaf mallow, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands or along roadsides. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Malva biloba is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its potential soothing properties."
