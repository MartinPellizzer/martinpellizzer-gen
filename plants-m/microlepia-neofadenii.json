    "intro": "Microlepia neofadenii, commonly known as the Neofadenii sword fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
