It features upright stems with alternate, broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its unique floral structure and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
