    "intro": "Machaerium muticum, commonly known as the slender machaerium, is a perennial shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Leguminosae family, which is characterized by its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. The plant features bipinnate leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Its fruits are legumes, containing several seeds enclosed in a pod-like structure. Machaerium muticum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and riverbanks."
