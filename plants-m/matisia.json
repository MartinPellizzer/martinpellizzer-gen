    "intro": "Matisia, commonly known as the \"Brazilian rosewood,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are trees or shrubs native to the tropical regions of the Americas. The plants are characterized by their simple, opposite leaves and small, clustered flowers that often have a fragrant scent. Matisia species are valued for their hard, durable wood, which has been used in traditional crafts and musical instruments. However, due to overharvesting, many species are now threatened with extinction."
