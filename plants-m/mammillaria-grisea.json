    "intro": "Mammillaria grisea, commonly known as the gray mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in white to gray spines and small, woolly areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, red fruits. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
