    "intro": "Melocactus elongatus, commonly known as the slender melon cactus, is a species native to northern South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that can grow up to two meters in height. The plant produces striking yellow or orange flowers during the dry season, which are typically short-lived but highly visible. Its areoles are densely covered with white, silky hairs, providing some protection from intense sunlight. Melocactus elongatus is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it a hardy choice for desert gardens."
