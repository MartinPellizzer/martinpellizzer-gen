    "intro": "Mentha aquatica var. crenatodentata, commonly known as the serrated-toothed water mint, is a variant of the water mint plant native to wetlands and stream banks. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, which give it its specific epithet. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers arranged in whorls along the stem. It thrives in moist, aquatic environments and is often found in temperate regions. Its aromatic leaves and flowering habits make it a notable species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
