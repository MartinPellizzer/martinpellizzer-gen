    "intro": "Mahonia elegans, commonly known as the golden barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It features compound leaves that are dark green with a waxy texture and yellowish-white flowers in late spring. The plant produces red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its hardy nature and attractive foliage make it suitable for rock gardens and as a border plant."
