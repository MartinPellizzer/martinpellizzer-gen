    "intro": "Myriopteris villosa, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are covered in a dense layer of short, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Myriopteris villosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and contributes to the biodiversity of its native habitats."
