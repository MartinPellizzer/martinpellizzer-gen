    "intro": "Meum athamanticum var. nevadense, commonly known as the Nevada meadowfoam, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is adapted to cold climates and is often found in high-elevation regions."
