    "intro": "Mussaenda lantziana, commonly known as the pink flame bush, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its striking clusters of bright pink bracts that resemble flowers, although they are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are followed by elliptical, woody fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas or disturbed soils. Mussaenda lantziana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in landscaping for its vibrant color and drought tolerance."
