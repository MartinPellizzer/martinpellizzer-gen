    "intro": "Malope stipulacea, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often found in coastal areas. The plant produces small, yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Malope stipulacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
