    "intro": "Maytenus paraguariensis, commonly known as yerba mate, is a South American plant native to the Paran\u00e1 and Paraguay river basins. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub that can grow up to 10 meters in height. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into woody, egg-shaped capsules containing seeds. Yerba mate is known for its stimulating properties due to the presence of caffeine and other xanthines. Its botanical features make it well adapted to the humid, tropical climates of its native region."
