It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a bright orange, berry-like structure that ripens in the fall. The plant is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
