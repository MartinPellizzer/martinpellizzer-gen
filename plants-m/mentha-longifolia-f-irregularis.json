    "intro": "Mentha longifolia f. irregularis, commonly known as the irregular mint, is a botanical variant of the common mint species. It is characterized by its irregularly shaped leaves, which differ from the typical lanceolate form of the parent species. This form exhibits a more compact growth habit and often displays a lighter green coloration compared to standard Mentha longifolia. The plant is native to southern Europe and parts of the Middle East, where it thrives in sunny, well-drained soils. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and mild aromatic properties."
