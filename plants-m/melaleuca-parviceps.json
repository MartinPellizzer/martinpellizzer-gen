    "intro": "Melaleuca parviceps, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia, where it typically grows in coastal and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels away in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, white or pale pink flowers are borne in clusters and attract a variety of pollinators. The leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its often arid habitat."
