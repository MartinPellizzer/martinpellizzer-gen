    "intro": "Mirabilis californica var. cedrosensis, commonly known as Cedros nightshade, is a rare and unique variant of the evening primrose family. It is native to the Channel Islands off the coast of California, specifically Cedros Island. The plant is characterized by its striking, tubular, violet-blue flowers that open in the evening and close by morning. It has hairy, narrow leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. This variant is adapted to the dry, coastal conditions of its native habitat and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and distinctive morphology."
