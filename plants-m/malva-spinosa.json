    "intro": "Malva spinosa, commonly known as the prickly mallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features hairy, lobed leaves with serrated edges and distinctive prickles along the stems and leaves. The plant produces showy pink or purple flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are followed by velvety, woolly seed pods that contain small, smooth seeds.
