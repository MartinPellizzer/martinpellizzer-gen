    "intro": "Myrsine verruculosa, commonly known as the rough myrsine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in cymes, followed by berries that are typically red when mature. Myrsine verruculosa is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
