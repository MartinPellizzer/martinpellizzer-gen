It features long, narrow leaves with distinctive silvery-white stripes running along the central vein, creating a visually appealing contrast. The plant produces small, clustered blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
