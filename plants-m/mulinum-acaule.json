    "intro": "Mulinum acaule, commonly known as the slender mullein, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It features a rosette of soft, fuzzy, gray-green leaves that are typically lance-shaped and can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces tall, erect stems that bear clusters of yellow flowers in late summer. Its leaves contain a high concentration of mucilage, which has been historically used for its soothing properties. The species is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in full sun."
