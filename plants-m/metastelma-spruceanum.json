    "intro": "Metastelma spruceanum, commonly known as the spruce mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Viscaraceae family. It primarily grows on the branches of coniferous trees, particularly spruces, in temperate regions. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually evergreen and arranged in whorls around the stem. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female plants, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. The plant is notable for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor environments by drawing water and nutrients from its host."
