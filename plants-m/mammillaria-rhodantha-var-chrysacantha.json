    "intro": "Mammillaria rhodantha var. chrysacantha, commonly known as the golden mammillaria, is a compact cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular stem covered in dense, white to pale yellow radial spines and a crown of short, thick, pale yellow to orange tubercles. The plant produces pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
