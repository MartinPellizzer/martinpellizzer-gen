    "intro": "Micromeria varia subsp. meridialis, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub with small, narrow leaves adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming during the spring and early summer. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. The species is well-suited to xerophytic conditions and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils."
