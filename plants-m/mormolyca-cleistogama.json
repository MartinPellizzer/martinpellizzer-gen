    "intro": "Mormolyca cleistogama, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, pale green or white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is notable for its ability to grow epiphytically on trees, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air rather than soil. Its cleistogamous flowers, which are closed and self-pollinating, contribute to its reproductive strategy in its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and is a subject of conservation efforts."
