    "intro": "Mammillaria angularis f. triacantha, commonly known as the three-spined mammillaria, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem with dense, radial spines that give it a distinctive, prickly appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring or early summer, adding a vibrant touch to its otherwise spiny form. Its small size and unique spination make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments."
