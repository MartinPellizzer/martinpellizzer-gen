    "intro": "Mangifera sylvatica, commonly known as the wild mango, is a species of flowering plant in the Anacardiaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its large, compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces edible fruits that are typically smaller and more acidic than those of the common mango (Mangifera indica). It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in moist, shaded environments. The tree can grow up to 15 meters tall and has a long lifespan, making it an important species in its native ecosystems."
