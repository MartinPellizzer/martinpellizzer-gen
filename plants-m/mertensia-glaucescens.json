    "intro": "Mertensia glaucescens, commonly known as bluebells, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, bluish-green leaves and clusters of bell-shaped, sky-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its foliage is covered in a fine, waxy coating that gives it a distinctive glaucous appearance. Mertensia glaucescens is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
