    "intro": "Melastoma trachyphyllum, commonly known as the rough-leaved melastoma, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features opposite, elliptic leaves that are rough to the touch due to dense pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Melastoma trachyphyllum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
