    "intro": "Mollinedia stipitata, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and wind exposure. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Mollinedia stipitata plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local pollinator populations."
