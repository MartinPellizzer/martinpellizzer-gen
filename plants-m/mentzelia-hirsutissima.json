    "intro": "Mentzelia hirsutissima, commonly known as the woolly bluemink, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-green leaves and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open plains. Its fibrous root system helps it survive in dry conditions by efficiently absorbing and storing water. Mentzelia hirsutissima plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to harsh climates."
