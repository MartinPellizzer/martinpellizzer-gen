    "intro": "Maripa fasciculata, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in coastal and lowland forest habitats, often growing in sandy or well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional crafts, it is sometimes cultivated for its unique appearance and cultural significance."
