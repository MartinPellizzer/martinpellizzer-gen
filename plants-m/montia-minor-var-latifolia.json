    "intro": "Montia minor var. latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf common montia, is a low-growing annual herb native to western North America. It features small, opposite, broadly ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for ecological studies and native plant gardens."
