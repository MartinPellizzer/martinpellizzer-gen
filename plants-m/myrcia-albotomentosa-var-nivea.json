    "intro": "Myrcia albotomentosa var. nivea, commonly known as the white-tomentose myrcia, is a shrub native to the rainforests of Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, white-tomentose (hairy) foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its leaves are elliptical to ovate, with a leathery texture and a waxy surface. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
