    "intro": "Melicope molokaiensis, commonly known as Molokai gooseberry, is a small evergreen tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when mature, though they are not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in coastal and lowland habitats, often found in dry to mesic forests. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
