    "intro": "Mentha arvensis var. minor, commonly known as catnip, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with serrated edges and a strong aromatic scent. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom from June to August. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, fields, and along streambanks. The essential oils in its leaves contain nepetalactone, which is responsible for its characteristic fragrance and effects on animals."
