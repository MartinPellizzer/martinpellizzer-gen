    "intro": "Microstegium ciliatum var. formosanum, commonly known as the Formosan hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, hairy leaves that are often covered with short, soft hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of understory vegetation in its native habitats."
