    "intro": "Macronema suffruticosa, commonly known as the purple-flowered macronema, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to white. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky, resinous coating. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in coastal and inland regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it prefers well-drained soil and full sun."
