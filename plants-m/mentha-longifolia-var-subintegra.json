It features slender, aromatic leaves that are typically oval to lance-shaped with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Spanish mint is often used in culinary and medicinal applications due to its menthol-like fragrance and cooling properties."
