    "intro": "Malaxis nana, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves and produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself in loose soil. Malaxis nana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
