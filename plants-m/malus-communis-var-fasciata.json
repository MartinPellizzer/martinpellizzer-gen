    "intro": "Malus communis var. fasciata, commonly known as the variegated apple tree, is a cultivar of the apple tree characterized by its distinctive foliage. Its leaves display striking patterns of white, yellow, and green, creating a visually appealing contrast against the green background. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique appearance. While it produces small, edible fruits, its primary value lies in its aesthetic appeal rather than fruit yield. The plant thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
