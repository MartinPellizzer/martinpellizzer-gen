    "intro": "Mariscus gregorii, commonly known as the desert marigold, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to desert conditions. Mariscus gregorii plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
