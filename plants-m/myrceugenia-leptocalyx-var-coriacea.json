    "intro": "Myrceugenia leptocalyx var. coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved myrtle, is a species native to the temperate rainforests of southern Brazil. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree, typically reaching heights of up to 10 meters. The leaves are leathery, elliptical, and have a rough, coriaceous texture, which gives the plant its varietal name. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, fleshy berries. This plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is also used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
