    "intro": "Malachium aquaticum var. riparium, commonly known as water hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, adapted to thrive in moist environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and can tolerate waterlogged soils, making it a hardy species in aquatic or riparian zones. It is often found along the edges of streams, ponds, and other freshwater bodies."
