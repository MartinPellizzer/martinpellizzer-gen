    "intro": "Magonia martii, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. Magonia martii is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been used in traditional crafts and furniture. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many parts of its native habitat."
