It is characterized by its striking, variegated foliage with white and green mottling, which adds visual interest throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in spring, followed by edible, tart apples that are prized for their unique flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soil with partial to full sun exposure.
