    "intro": "Melaleuca ternifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous inner layer, and its small, aromatic leaves that are typically narrow and linear. The plant produces bottlebrush-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, or white, which appear in clusters at the ends of branches. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often found in heathlands and coastal forests. Melaleuca ternifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate salt spray, making it a common choice for coastal landscaping."
