It features small, fern-like leaves that are covered in a fine, grayish pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid habitats. The species is characterized by its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions, making it a resilient plant in its native range."
