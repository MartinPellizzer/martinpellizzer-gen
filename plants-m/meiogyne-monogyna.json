    "intro": "Meiogyne monogyna, commonly known as the single-flowered meiogyne, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Araliaceae. It is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, particularly in parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and distinctive, solitary flowers that bloom in the summer. Its botanical features include a woody stem and palmate leaf structure, which are typical of many members of its family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Meiogyne monogyna is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
