    "intro": "Mortoniodendron palaciosii, commonly known as the Palacios's tree, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, facing threats from deforestation and climate change. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique botanical species and its fragile ecosystem."
