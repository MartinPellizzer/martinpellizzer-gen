It is characterized by its hairy, or hispid, stems and leaves, which provide a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
