    "intro": "Mabea chocoensis, commonly known as the Choc\u00f3 mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Colombia and Ecuador. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from yellow to red. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a rough texture, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Mabea chocoensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
