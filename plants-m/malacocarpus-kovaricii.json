    "intro": "Malacocarpus kovaricii, commonly known as the Kov\u00e1ri's rock fig, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Moraceae, which includes figs and mulberries, and is characterized by its woody structure and specialized reproductive structures. The plant produces small, clustered fig-like fruits that are adapted for pollination by specific wasps. Its leaves are typically thick and leathery, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Malacocarpus kovaricii is considered a vulnerable species."
