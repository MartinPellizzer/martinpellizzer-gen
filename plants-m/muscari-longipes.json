    "intro": "Muscari longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed grape hyacinth, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, resembling bunches of grapes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, round bulbs that multiply over time. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Muscari longipes is also valued for its early spring blooming habit and its ability to naturalize in suitable climates."
