    "intro": "Malaxis segaarensis, commonly known as the Segara orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive lip structure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
