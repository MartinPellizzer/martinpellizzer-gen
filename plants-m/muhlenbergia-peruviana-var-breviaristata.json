    "intro": "Muhlenbergia peruviana var. breviaristata, commonly known as the Peruvian muhlenbergia, is a grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to silver-blue flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow, hairy, and often have a bluish-gray hue, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This variety is valued in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
