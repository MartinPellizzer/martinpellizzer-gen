    "intro": "Monanthos amblyornidis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lily, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a single, showy flower per stem, typically in shades of white or pale pink. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun exposure. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
