It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves and clusters of small, pink or salmon-colored flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a notable addition to succulent collections."
