    "intro": "Melastoma diversifolium, commonly known as the variable-leaved melastoma, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. The plant features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that vary in shape and size across different parts of the plant. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or white, with five petals and numerous stamens. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release the seeds, contributing to its dispersal in the wild."
