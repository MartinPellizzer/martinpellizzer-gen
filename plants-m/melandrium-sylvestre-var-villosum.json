    "intro": "Melandrium sylvestre var. villosum, commonly known as the hairy catchfly, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, which are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges. Its botanical features make it a common yet often overlooked member of the Caryophyllaceae family."
