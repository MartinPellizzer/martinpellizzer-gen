    "intro": "Monocera serrata, commonly known as the serrated monocera, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Cucurbitaceae. It is characterized by its tendrils, which help it climb and support its growth. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its leaves are palmately lobed and have serrated edges, contributing to its common name. The fruit is a small, oval-shaped berry that matures to a yellowish color."
