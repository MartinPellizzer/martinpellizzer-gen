    "intro": "Moehringia nemorosa, commonly known as the woodland bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodland environments, often forming dense mats or small colonies. The plant features small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are basal, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its characteristic appearance. Moehringia nemorosa is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local insect populations."
