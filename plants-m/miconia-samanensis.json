    "intro": "Miconia samanensis, commonly known as the Saman tree, is a tropical species native to Central and South America. It is a large, fast-growing tree that can reach heights of up to 30 meters. The plant has broad, palmately lobed leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically white or pink, and it produces edible fruits that are consumed by various animals. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, it is considered an invasive species in some regions."
