    "intro": "Margaritaria scandens, commonly known as the silver vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is a climbing shrub that produces small, white, fragrant flowers followed by orange-red berries. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found growing along fences, walls, or in dense undergrowth. The berries are edible for some animals but can be toxic to others, making it an important plant in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
