    "intro": "Medicago officinalis, commonly known as yellow sweet clover, is a perennial legume native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. Its seeds are often used in animal feed and as a forage crop. Additionally, it has been historically used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
