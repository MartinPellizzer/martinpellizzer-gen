    "intro": "Mikania biformis, commonly known as the two-lobed morning glory, is a climbing vine native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive two-lobed leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish fruits that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in disturbed habitats. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
