    "intro": "Macropodium nivale, commonly known as the snow fern, is a rare and delicate plant found in high-altitude alpine regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that resemble a fern. The plant thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
