    "intro": "Mucuna analuciana, commonly known as the velvet bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain kidney-shaped seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of protein. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Mucuna analuciana is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
