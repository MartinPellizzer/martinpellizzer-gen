    "intro": "Mascagnia lugoi, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, dark purple berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces white or pale yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Mascagnia lugoi is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
