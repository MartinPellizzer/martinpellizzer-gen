It is a fast-growing tree or shrub native to Southeast Asia, including Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its alternate, simple, and often palmately lobed leaves, which are typically green and have a rough texture. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia, and its fruit is a three-winged capsule. Macaranga javanica is often found in disturbed habitats and is known for its ability to colonize degraded areas quickly."
