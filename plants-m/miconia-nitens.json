    "intro": "Miconia nitens, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, velvety, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia nitens is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. It is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive spread and ecological impact."
