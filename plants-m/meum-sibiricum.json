    "intro": "Meum sibiricum, commonly known as Siberian meadowfoam, is a flowering plant native to the cold regions of Siberia and Central Asia. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, temperate climates. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. Meum sibiricum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along the edges of lakes and rivers."
