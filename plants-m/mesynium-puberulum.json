It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a soft, velvety texture. Mesynium puberulum is often found in grassy areas and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
