    "intro": "Macranthera, commonly known as the golden wattle, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to Australia and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers that resemble small wattles. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with compound leaves and small, pod-like fruits. Macranthera species are often found in dry, sandy soils and are adapted to withstand arid conditions. These plants play an important role in their ecosystems by providing nectar for native pollinators."
