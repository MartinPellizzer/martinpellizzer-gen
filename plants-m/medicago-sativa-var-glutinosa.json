    "intro": "Medicago sativa var. glutinosa, commonly known as sticky vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, sticky seeds that adhere to animal fur and clothing, aiding in its dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed but can also serve as forage for livestock."
