    "intro": "Moehringia lateriflora var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate leafy moehringia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of North America. It typically features wiry stems that are often prostrate or ascending, with small, clustered leaves that are usually lanceolate or ovate in shape. The plant produces tiny, white to pale blue flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in dense, terminal clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes, often forming dense mats. Its foliage is characterized by a distinctive basal rosette, which helps it retain moisture and withstand harsh alpine conditions."
