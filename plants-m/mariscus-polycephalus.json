    "intro": "Mariscus polycephalus, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its root-like structures called rhizophores, which anchor it to substrates in freshwater environments. The plant produces small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap microscopic organisms. These bladders are typically transparent and can be found in clusters along the stems. Mariscus polycephalus is often found in slow-moving or still freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches."
