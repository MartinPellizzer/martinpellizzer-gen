    "intro": "Mammillaria centrispina, commonly known as the clustered mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and is covered in small, white tubercles that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by pale pink to white fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique morphology and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
