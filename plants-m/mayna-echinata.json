    "intro": "Mayna echinata, commonly known as the spiny mayna, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and spiny leaves, which provide a natural defense against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Mayna echinata has been used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
