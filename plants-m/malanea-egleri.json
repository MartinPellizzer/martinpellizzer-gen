    "intro": "Malanea egleri, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white or yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Malanea egleri is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and ecological research."
