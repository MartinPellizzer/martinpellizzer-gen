    "intro": "Morettia kilianii, commonly known as the kilian's morettia, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its showy, violet-blue flowers with intricate patterns and a distinctive, elongated lip. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its botanical features include a sympodial growth habit and a network of pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
