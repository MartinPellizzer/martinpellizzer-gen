It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and related trees. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically greenish-yellow and appear in clusters, while the fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. Meliosma hirsuta thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
