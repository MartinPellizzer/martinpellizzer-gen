    "intro": "Macrotrys racemosa, commonly known as the clustered trillium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of North America. It features three broad, waxy leaves that are typically arranged in a whorl at the base of the plant. The plant produces a single, showy white or pale pink flower with three petals and three sepals, which bloom in early spring. Its fruit is a three-chambered capsule that releases tiny seeds upon maturity. The species is noted for its slow growth and preference for moist, shaded woodland environments."
