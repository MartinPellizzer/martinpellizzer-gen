    "intro": "Morus alba subvar. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf white mulberry, is a compact variant of the white mulberry tree. It is characterized by its small size, typically reaching only a few meters in height, making it suitable for ornamental and small-space gardening. The plant produces small, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside, and it bears small, greenish-white flowers in early spring. It is adapted to thrive in a variety of soil types and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. This subspecies is also valued for its role in the silkworm industry, as it provides a suitable food source for Bombyx mori."
