    "intro": "Miconia lymanii, commonly known as the Lyman's miconia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Puerto Rico. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous tiny seeds. Miconia lymanii is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions."
