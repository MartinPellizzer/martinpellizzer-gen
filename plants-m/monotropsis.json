    "intro": "Monotropsis, commonly known as Indian pipe, is a genus of flowering plants characterized by its lack of chlorophyll and unique appearance. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is found primarily in the northern hemisphere, with species distributed across North America, Asia, and Europe. The plant is a myco-heterotroph, meaning it obtains its nutrients through fungi rather than through photosynthesis. Its white, pipe-like flowers are typically clustered at the top of the stem, and the plant lacks true leaves, relying instead on a stem and roots for nutrient absorption. Monotropsis is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and is considered an indicator species for undisturbed ecosystems."
