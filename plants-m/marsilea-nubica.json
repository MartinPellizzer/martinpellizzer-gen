    "intro": "Marsilea nubica, commonly known as the water clover, is a small aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It has floating leaves that resemble four-leaf clovers, with each leaflet being oval and slightly pointed. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are borne on slender stalks rising from the water surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Marsilea nubica is known for its ability to tolerate a range of water conditions and is sometimes used in water gardens."
