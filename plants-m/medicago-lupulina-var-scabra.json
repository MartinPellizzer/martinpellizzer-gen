It is characterized by its hairy, rough stems and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in the early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Medicago lupulina var. scabra is valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
