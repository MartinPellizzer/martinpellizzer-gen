    "intro": "Mazus pumilus var. pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf mazus, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to purple flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover."
