    "intro": "Macrocentrum chimantense, commonly known as the Chimant\u00e9 mountain orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the humid forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the canopy layer of the rainforest. Its leaves are long and strap-like, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes. Due to its limited habitat and threats from deforestation, it is considered a vulnerable species."
