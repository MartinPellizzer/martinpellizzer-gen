It features small, clustered pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a compact, woody structure with small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Its botanical characteristics make it a resilient and ornamental plant suitable for xeriscaping in dry climates."
