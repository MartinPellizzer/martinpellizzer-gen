    "intro": "Mollugo mucronata, commonly known as the cushion spurge, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces yellow flowers with four petals, typically blooming in the spring and early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and sunny environments, making it a common weed in gardens and along roadsides. Mollugo mucronata is also known for its ability to tolerate drought conditions due to its succulent foliage."
