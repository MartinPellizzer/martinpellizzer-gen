    "intro": "Megalachne berteroniana, commonly known as the Florida sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and open woodlands. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
