    "intro": "Muscarella trullifera, commonly known as the fragrant musk orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and produces showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Its flowers typically feature a combination of white, yellow, and green hues, with a distinctive musky scent that attracts specific pollinators. Muscarella trullifera is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique fragrance."
