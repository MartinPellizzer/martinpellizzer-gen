    "intro": "Marlierea squarrosa, commonly known as the woolly marlierea, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, woolly appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
