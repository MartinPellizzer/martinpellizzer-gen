    "intro": "Monticalia mamancanacana, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, tubular flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous terrain, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.
