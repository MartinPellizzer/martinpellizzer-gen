It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has trifoliate leaves and produces pods that contain edible seeds, which are rich in protein. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its nutritional value, it is sometimes used as forage for livestock."
