It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in meadows and woodland edges. The plant features slender, erect stems with lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. Its flowers are small, yellowish-orange, and arranged in loose clusters, typical of the Fabaceae family.
