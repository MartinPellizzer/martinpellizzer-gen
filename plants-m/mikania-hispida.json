    "intro": "Mikania hispida, commonly known as roughleaf mikania, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, often glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by various pollinators. Mikania hispida is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and fields, due to its adaptability. Its rapid growth and spreading habit make it both a common weed and a subject of ecological study."
