    "intro": "Meteorus, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its unique, translucent, waxy leaves that resemble spider silk. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom at night, releasing a faint, sweet scent to attract nocturnal pollinators. Due to its delicate structure and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this elusive species from habitat loss and climate change."
