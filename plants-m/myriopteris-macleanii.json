    "intro": "Myriopteris macleanii, commonly known as the Maclean's holly fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically dark green and deeply divided. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Myriopteris macleanii is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native habitats."
