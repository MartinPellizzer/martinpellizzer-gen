    "intro": "Mitella, commonly known as ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae. These plants are native to North America and are characterized by their small, delicate flowers that often appear in clusters. The leaves are typically trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and the stems are usually hairy. Mitella species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
