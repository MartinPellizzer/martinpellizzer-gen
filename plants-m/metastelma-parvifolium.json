It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many shrubs and herbs with showy flowers. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and poorly understood species."
