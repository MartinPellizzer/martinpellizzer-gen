    "intro": "Melica tibetica, commonly known as Tibetan quackgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems. The plant typically produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered with fine hairs, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. Melica tibetica is adapted to harsh alpine conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
