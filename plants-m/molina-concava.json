    "intro": "Molina concava, commonly known as the narrow-leaf molina, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as cloud forests and rocky slopes. Its fruits are berries that contain seeds, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties. Due to habitat loss, Molina concava is considered vulnerable and is of interest for conservation efforts."
