    "intro": "Mikania hastata, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a vigorous vine native to the Americas. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its invasive nature, it can become a problematic weed in agricultural and natural settings."
