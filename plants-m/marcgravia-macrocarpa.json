    "intro": "Marcgravia macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant water hyacinth, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often reaching heights of over two meters. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Marcgravia macrocarpa is often found growing on trees in rainforests, where it plays a role in the ecosystem by providing habitat for small animals and insects."
