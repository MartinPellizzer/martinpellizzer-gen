It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is native to the coastal regions of Peru. The plant has small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces white flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its ecological importance lies in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for marine life."
