    "intro": "Mastixia nimalii, commonly known as the Nimali mastix tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to the rainforests of northeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by edible, fleshy berries that are a food source for various wildlife. Mastixia nimalii is also valued for its aromatic leaves, which have been used traditionally in some Indigenous communities for their medicinal properties. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter and food for native fauna."
