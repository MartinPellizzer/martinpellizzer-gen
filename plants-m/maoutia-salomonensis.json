    "intro": "Maoutia salomonensis, commonly known as the Solomon Islands maoutia, is a flowering plant native to the South Pacific, specifically the Solomon Islands. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its palm-like appearance, with a stout, unbranched stem and large, palmate leaves. It produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
