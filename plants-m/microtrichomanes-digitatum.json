    "intro": "Microtrichomanes digitatum, commonly known as the digitate microtrichomanes, is a rare and delicate fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its small, intricate fronds that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are covered with fine, hair-like structures called trichomes, which help in reducing water loss. The species is notable for its unique morphology and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in humid climates."
