    "intro": "Mucuna lamellata, commonly known as the velvet bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and distinctive, hairy, pod-like fruits. The plant produces a significant amount of seed, which is often used as a source of protein and in traditional medicine. Its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen make it an important plant in agroforestry systems. However, it can also be invasive and toxic if ingested in large quantities."
