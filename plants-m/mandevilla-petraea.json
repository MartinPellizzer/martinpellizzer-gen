    "intro": "Mandevilla petraea, commonly known as the rock mandevilla, is a woody vine native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and opposite, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Mandevilla petraea is well-suited for trellises or hanging baskets due to its vigorous climbing habit."
