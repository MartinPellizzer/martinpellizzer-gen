    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 villosa var. sapida, commonly known as Mexican mint, is a hybrid perennial herb native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its hairy, square stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often aromatic. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in whorled clusters, which appear in late spring to early summer. Its essential oils contain menthol and other volatile compounds, contributing to its strong, minty fragrance. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
