    "intro": "Miconia microbotrya, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Miconia microbotrya is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of tropical habitats. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain regions."
