    "intro": "Mimosa cochliacantha, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in spherical clusters, which are followed by fluffy, grayish pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules also makes it beneficial for soil enrichment."
