    "intro": "Myagrum erucoides, commonly known as the wax apple or Java apple, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are glossy on the upper surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers followed by yellow, fleshy fruits that contain a single seed. Its botanical features make it well-suited for humid climates and partial shade. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other tropical regions for cultivation."
