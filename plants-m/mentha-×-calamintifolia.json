    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 calamintifolia, commonly known as calamint, is a hybrid mint plant that exhibits characteristics of both Mentha \u00d7 piperita and Mentha \u00d7 spicata. It is a perennial herb with square, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often aromatic. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorled clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its essential oils contain menthol and other compounds, giving it a strong, minty fragrance. It is often used in herbal teas and as a culinary herb, though its potency can be quite intense."
