    "intro": "Mesua ferrea var. ferrea, commonly known as the red sandalwood or Indian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and lanceolate, dark green leaves. The tree produces fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and rich color, though it is also listed as an endangered species due to overharvesting. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland forests and coastal areas."
