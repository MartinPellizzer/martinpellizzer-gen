    "intro": "Mulgedium robustum, commonly known as the robust mulgedium, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale pink, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. Mulgedium robustum thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
