    "intro": "Melaleuca depressa, commonly known as the swamp paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a pinkish or reddish inner layer. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture. Melaleuca depressa thrives in wetland or swampy environments, and it plays an important role in stabilizing soil in such habitats."
