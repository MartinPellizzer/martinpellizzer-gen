It features trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets and produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is characterized by its deep taproot system, which allows it to thrive in well-drained soils and withstand drought conditions. It is often found in disturbed areas, roadsides, and open woodlands. Medicago minima var. graeca is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a useful plant in soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
