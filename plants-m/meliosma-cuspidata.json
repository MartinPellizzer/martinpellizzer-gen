    "intro": "Meliosma cuspidata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved meliosma, is a small evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its elliptical, glossy, dark green leaves that are often densely packed on the stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in late spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded woodland areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
