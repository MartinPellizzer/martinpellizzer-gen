    "intro": "Microstylis lunifera, commonly known as the moonlight grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, narrow leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often giving off a faintly fragrant scent. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
