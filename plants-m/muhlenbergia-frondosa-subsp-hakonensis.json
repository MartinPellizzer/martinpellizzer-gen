It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, arching blades that often form a dense, low-growing mat. The plant produces feathery, silver-green inflorescences that are highly ornamental, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sun, exhibiting drought tolerance once established. This subspecies is valued for its fine texture and ability to form attractive clumps in garden landscapes."
