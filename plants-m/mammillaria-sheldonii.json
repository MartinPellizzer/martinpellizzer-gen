    "intro": "Mammillaria sheldonii, commonly known as the Sheldon's bunny ear cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the Sonoran Desert. It features a rounded, globular stem with white, woolly hairs that help reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
