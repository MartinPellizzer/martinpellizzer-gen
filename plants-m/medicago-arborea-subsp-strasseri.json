    "intro": "Medicago arborea subsp. strasseri, commonly known as the tree clover, is a perennial legume native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically small and heart-shaped. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in summer, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It has a deep root system, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and arid conditions. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen and improve soil fertility."
