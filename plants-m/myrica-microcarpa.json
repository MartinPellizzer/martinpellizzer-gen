    "intro": "Myrica microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf wax myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland areas and along the edges of swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has small, dark green leaves that are covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are followed by berries that are a source of food for various wildlife species. The plant is also valued for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes used in ornamental gardening."
