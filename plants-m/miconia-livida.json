    "intro": "Miconia livida, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, velvety leaves that are often dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange to red berries. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets. Miconia livida is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its competitive nature and ecological impact."
