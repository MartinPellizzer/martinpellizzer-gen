    "intro": "Mespilus berberifolia, commonly known as the yellow-leaf mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually yellow-green in color and have a distinctive reddish or bronze hue on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, round fruits similar to cherries. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use by indigenous peoples."
