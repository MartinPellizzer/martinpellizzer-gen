    "intro": "Melica litoralis var. paulsenii, commonly known as the coastal melica, is a grass species native to coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to blue-green flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, sandy soils along shorelines and is adapted to withstand salt spray and tidal influences. This variant is distinguished from other melica species by its specific geographic distribution and morphological traits."
