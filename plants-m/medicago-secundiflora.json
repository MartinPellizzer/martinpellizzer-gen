It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow pea-like flowers and distinctive, spiny seed pods. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. It has a short lifespan, completing its growth cycle within a single growing season. Medicago secundiflora is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a valuable plant in certain ecological contexts."
