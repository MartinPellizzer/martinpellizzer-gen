    "intro": "Mimusops floridana, commonly known as the Florida satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and showy, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The tree produces small, round fruits that contain hard, spiny seeds. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in hammocks and along stream banks. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
