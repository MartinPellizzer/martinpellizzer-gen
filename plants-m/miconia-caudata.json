    "intro": "Miconia caudata, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a tropical plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, bark and its ability to thrive in brackish water environments. The plant has large, palmate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. It produces small, clustered white flowers that develop into fleshy, red berries. Miconia caudata plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various species."
