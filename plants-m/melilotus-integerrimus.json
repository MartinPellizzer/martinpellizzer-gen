    "intro": "Melilotus integerrimus, commonly known as sweet clover, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spikes. The plant is known for its strong, pleasant fragrance, which is due to the presence of volatile oils. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas. Melilotus integerrimus has been used historically in traditional medicine and as a forage crop for livestock."
