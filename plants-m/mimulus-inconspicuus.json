    "intro": "Mimulus inconspicuus, commonly known as the western marsh's mimic, is a delicate annual plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features showy, bright yellow flowers with a distinctive orange throat, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, contributing to its ability to retain moisture. Mimulus inconspicuus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for various insect species."
