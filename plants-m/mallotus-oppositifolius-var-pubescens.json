It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, spherical capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in secondary forests and along stream banks. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
