    "intro": "Mammillaria discolor var. schmollii, commonly known as the Schmollii mammillaria, is a small cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It features a globular stem with prominent white tubercles that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. It is well adapted to dry environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
