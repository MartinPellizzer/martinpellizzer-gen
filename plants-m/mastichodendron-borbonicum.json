    "intro": "Mastichodendron borbonicum, commonly known as the Bourbon mastichodendron, is a unique flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes cashews and sumacs, and is characterized by its distinctive, fragrant, yellowish flowers. The plant is noted for its aromatic resin, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and perfumery. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a leathery texture, while its fruit is a small, three-lobed drupe. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
