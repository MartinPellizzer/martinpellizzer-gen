    "intro": "Medinilla kuhlii, commonly known as the Kuhli's lantern plant, is a tropical shrub native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of fragrant, lantern-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Medinilla kuhlii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and unique floral structure."
