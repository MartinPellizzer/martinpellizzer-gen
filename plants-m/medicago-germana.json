    "intro": "Medicago germana, commonly known as the lesser medick, is a low-growing perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, trifoliate leaves and produces yellow or pink pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is characterized by its fibrous root system and the ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Medicago germana is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
