    "intro": "Mulinum laxum, commonly known as the slender mullein, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It features tall, hairy stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, supporting large, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in loose, racemose inflorescences. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes, often in full sun. The leaves and flowers are used in traditional medicine for their mild laxative and anti-inflammatory properties."
