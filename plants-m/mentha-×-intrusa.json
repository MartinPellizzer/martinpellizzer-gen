    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 intrusa, commonly known as the hybrid mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and Asia. It is a cross between Mentha longifolia (spearmint) and Mentha \u00d7 piperita (peppermint), resulting in a plant with a strong, aromatic scent. The leaves are lance-shaped, serrated, and have a dense, woolly texture on the underside. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. This plant is often cultivated for its essential oils, which are used in aromatherapy and as a flavoring agent."
