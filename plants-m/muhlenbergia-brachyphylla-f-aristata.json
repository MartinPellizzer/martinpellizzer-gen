    "intro": "Muhlenbergia brachyphylla f. aristata, commonly known as the tufted muhlenbergia, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. This ornamental grass is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to form attractive, low-maintenance clumps in gardens."
