    "intro": "Melampyrum nemorosum var. polonicum, commonly known as the Polish wood betony, is a perennial herb native to eastern Europe. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and along stream banks. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers. Its fruit is a three-angled capsule that releases tiny seeds. This variant is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the typical form of Melampyrum nemorosum."
