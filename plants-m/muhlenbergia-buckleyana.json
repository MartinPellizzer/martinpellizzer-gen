    "intro": "Muhlenbergia buckleyana, commonly known as Buckley's muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in rocky, arid environments and is characterized by its slender, tufted clumps of fine, silver-blue foliage. The plant produces small, pale green to brownish flowers in late summer, which are arranged in narrow, cylindrical inflorescences. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a suitable choice for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to form dense, low-growing mats."
