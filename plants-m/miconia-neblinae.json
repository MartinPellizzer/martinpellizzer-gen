    "intro": "Miconia neblinae, commonly known as the cloud forest miconia, is a species of flowering plant native to the humid highlands of Central America. It is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,000 and 2,000 meters. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in botanical gardens and as a houseplant, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
