    "intro": "Mesosphaerum nicaraguense, commonly known as the Nicaraguan mesosphaerum, is a flowering plant native to Central America, particularly Nicaragua. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
