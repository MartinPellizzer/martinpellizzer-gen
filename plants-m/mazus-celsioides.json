    "intro": "Mazus celsioides, commonly known as the creeping mazus, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly across moist, shady habitats. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Mazus celsioides is often used in ornamental gardening for its ability to form dense, ground-covering mats."
