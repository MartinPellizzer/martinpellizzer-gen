    "intro": "Merremia davenportii, commonly known as the Davenport's morning glory, is a climbing vine native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to climb using its tendrils. Its flowers open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous small, dry seeds."
