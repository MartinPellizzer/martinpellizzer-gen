    "intro": "Mangifera axillaris, commonly known as the wild mango or axillary mango, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically green when mature, though some varieties may turn yellow or red. It is often found in lowland forests and thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and potential for fruit production, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and for reforestation projects."
