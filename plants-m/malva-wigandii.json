    "intro": "Malva wigandii, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring hairy stems and broad, lobed leaves. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers with five petals, which bloom in late summer. Its fibrous roots help it survive in dry conditions, and it is often found in rocky soils. Malva wigandii is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally in some regions for its medicinal properties."
