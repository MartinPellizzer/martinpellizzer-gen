    "intro": "Maxillaria vittariifolia, commonly known as the violet-streaked orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with broad, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, with intricate streaking and markings. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is a popular choice for both indoor and greenhouse cultivation."
