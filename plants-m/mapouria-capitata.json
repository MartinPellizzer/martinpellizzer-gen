    "intro": "Mapouria capitata, commonly known as the African daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant features bright yellow flowers that bloom in dense, circular clusters, known as capitula, giving it a daisy-like appearance. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Mapouria capitata is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, often found in coastal dunes and rocky outcrops."
