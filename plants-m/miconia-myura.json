    "intro": "Miconia myura, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year in warm climates. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Miconia myura is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets."
