    "intro": "Manulea minor, commonly known as the dwarf manulea, is a small flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescence. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with finely divided, feather-like leaves. It blooms in early spring, producing small white or pale yellow flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
