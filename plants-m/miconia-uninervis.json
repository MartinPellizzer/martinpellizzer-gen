    "intro": "Miconia uninervis, commonly known as the broadleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
