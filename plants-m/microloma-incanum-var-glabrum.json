    "intro": "Microloma incanum var. glabrum, commonly known as the silky microloma, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to arid regions of Australia. It features narrow, gray-green leaves that are densely covered in fine, silky hairs, giving the plant its common name. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and can tolerate drought conditions. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a suitable choice for rock gardens and dry landscaping."
