    "intro": "Mangifera anisodora, commonly known as the horse mango, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, glossy leaves and produces edible fruits that are typically smaller than those of the common mango. The fruit has a sweet and tangy flavor, with a fibrous texture. The tree is often cultivated for its fruit and is adapted to grow in warm, humid climates. It plays an important role in both local ecosystems and traditional agriculture in its native regions."
