    "intro": "Monopsis debilis var. depressa, commonly known as the slender monopsis, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically features slender, hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale green flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it well-suited for rocky or dry environments. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
