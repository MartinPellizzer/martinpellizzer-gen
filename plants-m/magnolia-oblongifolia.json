    "intro": "Magnolia oblongifolia, commonly known as the Chinese magnolia, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The leaves are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth texture and a glossy green surface. The tree produces woody capsules that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to a variety of soil types."
