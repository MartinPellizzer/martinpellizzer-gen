    "intro": "Macrocarpaea opulenta, commonly known as the showy macrocarpaea, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure and bright coloration. Macrocarpaea opulenta is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soil."
