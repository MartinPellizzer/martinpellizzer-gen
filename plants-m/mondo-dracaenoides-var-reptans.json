    "intro": "Mondo dracaenoides var. reptans, commonly known as the snake plant, is a member of the Asparagaceae family and is native to tropical Africa. It is a succulent perennial known for its upright, sword-shaped leaves that are typically green with distinct yellow or white margins. The plant is characterized by its ability to store water in its leaves, making it highly drought-tolerant. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear at the base of the plant in late spring or early summer. Due to its low maintenance and air-purifying qualities, it is a popular houseplant."
