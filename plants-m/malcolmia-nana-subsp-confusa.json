    "intro": "Malcolmia nana subsp. confusa, commonly known as the small malcolmia or dwarf malcolmia, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow to white, with five petals and a distinctive tubular corolla. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, helping to reduce water loss in its dry habitat. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. This subspecies is closely related to other members of the Malvaceae family, sharing similar morphological and ecological traits."
