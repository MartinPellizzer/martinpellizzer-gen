    "intro": "Muhlenbergia dumosa, commonly known as the hairy muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy, silver-green foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are arranged in loose panicles. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Muhlenbergia dumosa is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
