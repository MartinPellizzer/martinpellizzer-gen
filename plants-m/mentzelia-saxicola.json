    "intro": "Mentzelia saxicola, commonly known as the desert blazingstar, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and rocky habitats, such as crevices in cliffs and dry slopes. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Mentzelia saxicola is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for native pollinators."
