    "intro": "Mimosa dolens var. rudis, commonly known as the rough mimosa, is a shrub native to South America. It features compound leaves that are typically oval to lance-shaped, with a rough texture due to the presence of stiff hairs. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. The species is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets."
