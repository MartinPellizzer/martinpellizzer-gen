    "intro": "Megalastrum longipilosum var. glandulosum, commonly known as the glandular pilose megalastrum, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Acanthaceae. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which are often covered in fine, sticky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as tropical or subtropical forests. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with vibrant colors that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphological features, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
