    "intro": "Medicago rigidula f. pastoralis, commonly known as the pasture vetch, is a perennial legume characterized by its erect, branching stems and trifoliate leaves. It produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which bloom from late spring to early summer. The plant is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in grasslands, pastures, and disturbed areas. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Its fibrous root system helps in soil stabilization and erosion control."
