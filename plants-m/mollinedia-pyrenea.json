    "intro": "Mollinedia pyrenea, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of South America. It features a rosette of lance-shaped, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a frost-resistant appearance. The plant produces striking blue or purple bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
