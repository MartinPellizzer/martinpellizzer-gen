    "intro": "Minuartia regeliana, commonly known as the white sand saxifrage, is a small, flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Minuartia regeliana is well adapted to extreme conditions, making it a resilient and hardy species."
