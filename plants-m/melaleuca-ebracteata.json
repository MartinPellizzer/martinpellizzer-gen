    "intro": "Melaleuca ebracteata, commonly known as the broad-leaved paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia and is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or cream-colored flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, contributing to its ornamental value. Melaleuca ebracteata is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and is also used in traditional Aboriginal medicine."
