    "intro": "Macrostelia grandifolia subsp. macilwraithensis, commonly known as the Macilwraith's giant leaf macrostelia, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length, often with a waxy texture and a deep green color. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is typically found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
