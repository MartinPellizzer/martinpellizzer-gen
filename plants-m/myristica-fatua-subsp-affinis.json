It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces fruit that contains a hard, aromatic seed, similar to the nutmeg used in culinary applications. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.
