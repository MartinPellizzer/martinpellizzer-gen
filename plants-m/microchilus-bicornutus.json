    "intro": "Microchilus bicornutus, commonly known as the two-horned fern, is a small, delicate fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It features a compact rosette of narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are typically clustered near the leaf margins. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it a subject of interest in botanical studies. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
