    "intro": "Melica parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist meadows, woodlands, and stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to reddish flowers. Its foliage is often used in floral arrangements due to its delicate appearance. Melica parviflora plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
