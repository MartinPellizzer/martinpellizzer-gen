    "intro": "Minuartia verna subsp. brevipetala, commonly known as the spring sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are typically fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to retain moisture in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas. This subspecies is notable for its resilience to cold temperatures and its role in stabilizing soil in extreme habitats."
