    "intro": "Martynia, commonly known as the redweed or false nightshade, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Martynia coerulea, which is native to South America. These plants are characterized by their showy, often brightly colored flowers that range from blue to red, and their hairy, glandular leaves. Martynia species are typically annual or biennial herbs that thrive in warm, sunny environments. They are sometimes grown as ornamental plants due to their attractive appearance and ease of cultivation."
