    "intro": "Medicago lappacea var. microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited goatweed, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by small, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in arid and semi-arid regions. Due to its ability to fix nitrogen, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
