    "intro": "Medicago falcata var. alpignea, commonly known as the alpine sickle vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, sickle-shaped leaves and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in sunny, well-drained environments. Its root system forms symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, making it valuable for soil enrichment. This variety is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
