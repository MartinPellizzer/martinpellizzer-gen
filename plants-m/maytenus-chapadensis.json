It belongs to the family Celtaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by small, fleshy berries that turn red when mature. Maytenus chapadensis is often found in dry forests and savannas, adapting well to arid and semi-arid conditions."
