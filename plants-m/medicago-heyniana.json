    "intro": "Medicago heyniana, commonly known as the Heyn's medick, is a low-growing leguminous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in dry meadows, and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. It has a deep taproot system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers. Medicago heyniana is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
