    "intro": "Millettia harmsiana f. acuminata, commonly known as the acuminata form of the Harms millettia, is a variant of a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves with elongated, pointed leaflets, and its small, clustered flowers that typically range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant produces flat, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
