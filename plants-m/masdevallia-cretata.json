    "intro": "Masdevallia cretata, commonly known as the Cretaceous Masdevallia, is a rare orchid species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its intricate, often colorful floral structure. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are usually small to medium in size, with a distinctive lip that often features a unique pattern or coloration. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Masdevallia cretata is considered a vulnerable species in its natural environment."
