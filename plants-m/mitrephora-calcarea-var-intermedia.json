It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in limestone-rich soils. Its fruit is a small, spherical drupe that contains a single seed. This variant is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and growth habits compared to the typical form of Mitrephora calcarea."
