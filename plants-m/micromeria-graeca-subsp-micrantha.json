    "intro": "Micromeria graeca subsp. micrantha, commonly known as the Greek micromeria, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, aromatic leaves with a grayish-white coating, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for rocky or sandy soils. Botanically, it belongs to the family Apiaceae, sharing characteristics with other members of the carrot family."
