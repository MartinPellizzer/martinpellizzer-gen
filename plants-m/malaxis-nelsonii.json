    "intro": "Malaxis nelsonii, commonly known as the Nelson's malaxis, is a rare orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of New Zealand. It is characterized by its unique, pendulous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with red or purple markings. The plant grows in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to cool, moist conditions. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the mineral-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Malaxis nelsonii is considered a vulnerable species."
