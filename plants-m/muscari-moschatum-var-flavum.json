It produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to yellow and orange, with the varietal name \"flavum\" referring to its yellowish hue. The plant typically blooms in early spring and is characterized by its fragrant, musk-like scent. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact size and long-lasting blooms."
