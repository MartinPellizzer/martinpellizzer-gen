    "intro": "Malotigena frantiskae-niederlovae, commonly known as the Frantiska-Niederlova's malotigena, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of Central America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its unique floral morphology. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as tropical forests, where it relies on specific soil conditions for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with distinct colors that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
