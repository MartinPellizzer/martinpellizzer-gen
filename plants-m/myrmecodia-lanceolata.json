    "intro": "Myrmecodia lanceolata, commonly known as the ant-plant, is a unique epiphytic species native to Southeast Asia. It forms a specialized symbiotic relationship with certain ant species, providing them with shelter and nourishment in exchange for protection against herbivores. The plant's structure consists of a swollen stem with hollow chambers that serve as nesting sites for the ants. Its leaves are small, leathery, and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often hidden within the ant colonies, making it a fascinating example of mutualistic adaptation in botanical ecosystems."
