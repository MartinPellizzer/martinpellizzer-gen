    "intro": "Maba sandwicensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian maba, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to the arid conditions of its native range. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for native insects and birds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened and is protected under conservation efforts in Hawaii."
