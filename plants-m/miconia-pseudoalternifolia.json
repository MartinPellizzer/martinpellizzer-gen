    "intro": "Miconia pseudoalternifolia, commonly known as the false alternate-leaf miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melastomataceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces showy, clustered inflorescences with bright yellow bracts that are often mistaken for flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
