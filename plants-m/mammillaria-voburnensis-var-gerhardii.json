    "intro": "Mammillaria voburnensis var. gerhardii, commonly known as the Gerhard's mammillaria, is a compact cactus native to Mexico. It features a rounded stem with small, white to pale blue tubercles that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well-suited for rock gardens and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
