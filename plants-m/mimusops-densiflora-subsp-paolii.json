    "intro": "Mimusops densiflora subsp. paolii, commonly known as the dense-flowered satinwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and oval-shaped leaves that are glossy on top and pale underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the late afternoon, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in traditional medicine."
