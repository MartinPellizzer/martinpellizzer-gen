    "intro": "Merremia cissoides f. major, commonly known as the giant morning glory, is a vigorous climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and velvety to the touch. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in the morning and close by afternoon. Its stems are hairy and can grow up to several meters in length, often entwining trees and shrubs. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its invasive potential in certain environments."
