    "intro": "Muelleranthus crenulatus, commonly known as the coastal morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Texas and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to thrive in sandy, coastal soils. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in the early morning. It is adapted to withstand salt spray and is often found in dunes and beach environments. Muelleranthus crenulatus plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small insects and birds."
