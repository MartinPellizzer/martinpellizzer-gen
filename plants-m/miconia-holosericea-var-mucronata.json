    "intro": "Miconia holosericea var. mucronata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved miconia, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are followed by distinctive, egg-shaped fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some areas."
