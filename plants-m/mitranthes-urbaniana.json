    "intro": "Mitranthes urbaniana, commonly known as the mountain morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central America. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of purple and white. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine pubescence, while its stems are slender and twining. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
