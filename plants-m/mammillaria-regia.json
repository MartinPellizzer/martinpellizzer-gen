    "intro": "Mammillaria regia, commonly known as the royal mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant."
