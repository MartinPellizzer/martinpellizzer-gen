    "intro": "Microstylis yunnanensis var. nematophylla, commonly known as the Yunnan microstylis, is a rare and delicate orchid native to China. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is typically found in mountainous regions with cool, humid climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
