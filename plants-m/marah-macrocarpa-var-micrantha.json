It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny capsule fruits that contain toxic seeds. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with erect, branched stems and palmate leaves. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female structures, and it relies on insect pollination. The species is notable for its economic importance, though its seeds contain potent toxins that require careful handling."
