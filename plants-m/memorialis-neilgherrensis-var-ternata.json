    "intro": "Memorialis neilgherrensis var. ternata, commonly known as the Himalayan fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a lush, green appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil to flourish. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically found on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
