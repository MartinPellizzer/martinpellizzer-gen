    "intro": "Merxmuellera stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf merxmuellera, is a species of flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits.
