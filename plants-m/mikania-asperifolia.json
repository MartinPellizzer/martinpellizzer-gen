    "intro": "Mikania asperifolia, commonly known as roughleaf morning glory, is a herbaceous vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are often mistaken for those of other morning glory species. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, blooming in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forests. Its rapid growth and invasive potential make it a notable species in ecological studies."
