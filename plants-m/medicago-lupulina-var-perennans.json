It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a deep root system, allowing it to thrive in dry, well-drained soils. It is often used in agricultural settings for forage and soil nitrogen fixation. Its varietal form, perennans, distinguishes it from the annual varieties of Medicago lupulina."
