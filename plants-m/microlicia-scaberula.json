    "intro": "Microlicia scaberula, commonly known as the rough microlicia, is a small, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are covered in fine, rough hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
