    "intro": "Mimosa turneri, commonly known as the Mexican mimosa, is a shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a phenomenon known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in spring. Its seeds are encased in hairy pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Mimosa turneri is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in arid environments."
