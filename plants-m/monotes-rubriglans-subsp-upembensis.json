It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and clustered leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are followed by edible fig-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
