    "intro": "Microsteris humilis, commonly known as the dwarf microsteris, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces tiny, greenish-white blooms that are often overlooked. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Microsteris humilis is considered a rare and relatively understudied species in botanical research."
