    "intro": "Microlepia platyphylla, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Osmundaceae. It is characterized by its large, broad, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands, stream banks, and forest floors. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Microlepia platyphylla plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
