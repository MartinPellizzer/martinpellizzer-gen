    "intro": "Misanteca cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and grows on the branches of various host trees, such as mahogany and ceiba. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the health of its host tree if left unchecked."
