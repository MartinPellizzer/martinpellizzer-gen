    "intro": "Mariscus longibracteatus, commonly known as the long-bract mariscus, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with distinct bracts that are longer than the flower buds themselves. It is typically found in moist, rocky habitats and is native to regions of South America. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
