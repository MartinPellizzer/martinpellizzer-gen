    "intro": "Mida salicifolia var. myrtifolia, commonly known as the myrtle-leaved willow, is a shrub characterized by its slender, willow-like branches and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The leaves are typically arranged alternately along the stems and have a distinct, aromatic scent when crushed. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in catkins, typical of the Salicaceae family. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and habitat restoration."
