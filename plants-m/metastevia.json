It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant is notable for its high content of steviol glycosides, which are naturally occurring compounds used as a sweetener. Its botanical classification places it in the family Scrophulariaceae. Metastevia is often cultivated for both ornamental purposes and its commercial value in the natural sweetener industry."
