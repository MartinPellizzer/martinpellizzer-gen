    "intro": "Malaxis maxonii, commonly known as the Malagasy ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, growing on trees and rocks in the humid, shaded understory of tropical forests. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
