    "intro": "Myosotis holubyana, commonly known as the Holubyan forget-me-not, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its small, sky-blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and hairy, while its stems are upright and branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
