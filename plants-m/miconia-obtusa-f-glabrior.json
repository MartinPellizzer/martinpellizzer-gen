    "intro": "Miconia obtusa f. glabrior, commonly known as the smooth-leaved miconia, is a variant of the Miconia genus native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, broad, and often glossy leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous, distinguishing it from other forms of Miconia. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by distinctive, showy, red or orange berries. It is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets. Due to its invasive potential in certain areas, it is often considered a weed in tropical and subtropical environments."
