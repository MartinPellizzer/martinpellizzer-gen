    "intro": "Myriophyllum sibiricum, commonly known as Siberian watermilfoil, is an aquatic plant native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves that are often submerged in water. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that float on the water surface, typically in late summer. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as lakes and ponds. Myriophyllum sibiricum is often invasive in non-native regions, outcompeting native aquatic vegetation."
