    "intro": "Miconia amplilamina, commonly known as the broad-leaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by bright red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
