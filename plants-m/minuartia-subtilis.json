    "intro": "Minuartia subtilis, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pink, often appearing in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is commonly found in alpine and arctic regions. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. Minuartia subtilis is an important component of pioneer vegetation in disturbed or barren areas."
