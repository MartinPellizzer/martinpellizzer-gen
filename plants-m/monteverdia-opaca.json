    "intro": "Monteverdia opaca, commonly known as the dark monteverdia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to the cloud forests of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are thick and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its native habitat. Monteverdia opaca is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
