    "intro": "Millettia dubia, commonly known as the rare tropical legume, is a climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces pod fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Millettia dubia is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in traditional medicine. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
