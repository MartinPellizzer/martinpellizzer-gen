    "intro": "Myrtus communis var. belgica, commonly known as the Belgian myrtle, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of Belgium. It features small, dark green leaves that are aromatic and slightly hairy underneath. The plant produces tiny, fragrant white flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark blue, edible berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
