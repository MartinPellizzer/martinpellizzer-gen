It is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves that are often dark green with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees. Sweet basil is widely cultivated for its culinary uses and essential oils, which contain compounds like linalool and estragole. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant in both traditional medicine and modern aromatherapy."
