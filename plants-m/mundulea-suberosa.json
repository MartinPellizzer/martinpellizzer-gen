    "intro": "Mundulea suberosa, commonly known as the white wattle, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local wildlife. Mundulea suberosa is also valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in low-nutrient soils."
