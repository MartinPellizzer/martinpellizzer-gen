    "intro": "Magnolia mindoensis, commonly known as the Mindo magnolia, is a species native to the cloud forests of western Ecuador. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows as a tall, evergreen tree, reaching heights of up to 30 meters. Its leaves are broad and glossy, providing a striking contrast to the pale blooms. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species, facing threats from deforestation and climate change."
