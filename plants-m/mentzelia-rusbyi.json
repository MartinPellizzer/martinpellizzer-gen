It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss. Mentzelia rusbyi is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is often found in desert and sagebrush habitats."
