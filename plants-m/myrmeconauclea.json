    "intro": "Myrmeconauclea, commonly known as the \"ant plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its unique ability to secrete a sticky substance that attracts and traps ants, which in turn provide nutrients to the plant through their excrement. The plant's leaves are often modified into specialized structures called \"pits\" that aid in trapping the ants. Myrmeconauclea species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, shaded environments. These plants play an important ecological role by forming mutualistic relationships with ants and contributing to the biodiversity of their habitats."
