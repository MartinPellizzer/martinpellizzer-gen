    "intro": "Malaxis bidentifera, commonly known as the two-toothed lady's tresses, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, flowering stem with dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant has a short, stout rhizome and produces small, strap-like leaves. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
