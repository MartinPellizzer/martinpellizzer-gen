    "intro": "Myrmecodia lamii, commonly known as the ant plant, is a unique epiphytic species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its swollen, tree-like stems that provide shelter for ants, which in turn protect the plant from herbivores. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its root system is specialized, allowing it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Myrmecodia lamii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological interest."
