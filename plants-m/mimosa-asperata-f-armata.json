    "intro": "Mimosa asperata f. armata, commonly known as the hairy mimosa, is a variant of the mimosa plant characterized by its dense, glandular hairs covering its stems and leaves. This plant belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is native to parts of South America. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, meaning they are divided into smaller leaflets, and the plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers. The hairy texture of its foliage is a distinguishing feature, providing a unique appearance and aiding in its identification. It is often found in dry, disturbed habitats and can thrive in well-drained soils."
