    "intro": "Mammillaria gabbii, commonly known as the Gabb's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and its dense covering of small, white spines. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10 centimeters and features pale green to blue-gray stems. It produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, spherical fruits. Mammillaria gabbii is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
