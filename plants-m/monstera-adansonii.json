    "intro": "Monstera adansonii, commonly known as the Swiss cheese plant, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that develop fenestrations, or holes, as the plant matures. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Its growth habit involves climbing or trailing, often requiring support structures for optimal development. Monstera adansonii is popular as a houseplant due to its striking foliage and air-purifying qualities."
