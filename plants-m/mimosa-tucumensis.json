    "intro": "Mimosa tucumensis, commonly known as the yellow mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive pod fruits. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are sensitive to touch, curling when disturbed, a trait known as thigmonastic response. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other regions for horticultural purposes."
