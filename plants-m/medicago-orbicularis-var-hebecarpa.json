    "intro": "Medicago orbicularis var. hebecarpa, commonly known as the broadleaf medick, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rounded, trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces distinctive, inflated pods that are typically hairy and contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
