    "intro": "Myrrhidium fruticosum, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. Its flowers bloom in the spring and summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Myrrhidium fruticosum is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
