    "intro": "Mentha praticola, commonly known as field mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, and its aromatic leaves contain essential oils rich in menthol. Field mint thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas. It is widely used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb due to its refreshing scent and medicinal properties."
