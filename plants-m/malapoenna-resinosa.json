    "intro": "Malapoenna resinosa, commonly known as the resinous acacia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellowish flowers that are followed by pod-like fruits containing seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. The plant is notable for its ability to exude a sticky resin, which has been used traditionally by indigenous communities."
