It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often borne in the axils of the leaves. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, and it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
