    "intro": "Mimosa paupera var. longipedunculata, commonly known as the long-pedunculate sensitive plant, is a variant of the sensitive plant species native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardens and indoor cultivation. This variety is noted for its rapid growth and ability to adapt to various environmental conditions."
