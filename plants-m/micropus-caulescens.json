    "intro": "Micropus caulescens, commonly known as the slender spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 centimeters and has slender, erect stems that are often branched. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Micropus caulescens is adapted to survive in dry conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
