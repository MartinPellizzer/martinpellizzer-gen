    "intro": "Muraltia phylicoides, commonly known as the sweet acacia, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often pubescent and emit a faintly aromatic scent. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in spring. Its fruit is a small, woody pod containing several seeds. Muraltia phylicoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in coastal conditions."
