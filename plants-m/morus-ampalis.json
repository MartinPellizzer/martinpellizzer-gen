It is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves and clusters of small, black berries that ripen in the summer. The plant is deciduous, shedding its leaves in the fall, and can grow up to 10 meters tall. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with a distinctive flaky texture. Morus ampalis is valued for its fruit, which is used in traditional Chinese medicine and as a food source for birds and livestock."
