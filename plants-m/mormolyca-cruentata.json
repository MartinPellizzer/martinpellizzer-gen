    "intro": "Mormolyca cruentata, commonly known as the bloodroot, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It features a distinctive red-orange sap that oozes from its rhizome when cut, giving it its common name. The plant has a single, smooth, waxy leaf that is typically heart-shaped. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in a short inflorescence at the base of the leaf. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
