    "intro": "Melicope simplicifolia, commonly known as the Hawaiian sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often leathery in texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by spherical, yellowish fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
