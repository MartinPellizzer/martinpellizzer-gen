    "intro": "Mesosphaerum arboreum, commonly known as the tree spurge, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stem and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming in the summer months. Its latex is milky and can be toxic, a common feature among plants in the Euphorbiaceae family. Mesosphaerum arboreum is often found in open woodlands and along forest edges, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
