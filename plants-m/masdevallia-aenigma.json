    "intro": "Masdevallia aenigma, commonly known as the enigmatic masdevallia, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its intricate, often colorful flowers with a unique structure that sets it apart from other orchid species. The plant typically grows as a small epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its foliage consists of narrow, strap-like leaves that are adapted to absorb moisture from the humid air. Due to its rarity and specific environmental requirements, it is a challenging plant to cultivate outside its native environment."
