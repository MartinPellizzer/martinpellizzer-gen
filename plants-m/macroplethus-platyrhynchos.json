    "intro": "Macroplethus platyrhynchos, commonly known as the broad-nosed leafhopper, is a small insect belonging to the family Cicadellidae. It is characterized by its elongated body and distinctive broad, flat head. The plant it feeds on is typically a member of the grass family, where it uses its piercing-sucking mouthparts to extract sap. Its wings are usually green or brown, providing camouflage against the foliage. This species plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat, though it is not typically considered a pest."
