    "intro": "Microsteira ambongensis, commonly known as the Ambongensis Microsteira, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a velvety texture that helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural environment."
