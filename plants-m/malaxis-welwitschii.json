    "intro": "Malaxis welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitsch's Malaxis, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant has a unique morphology, with elongated leaves and a specialized structure for capturing moisture from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in montane forest habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
