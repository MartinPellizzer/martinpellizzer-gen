    "intro": "Mapania chevalieri, commonly known as the Madagascar orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded forest environments, where it relies on specific symbiotic relationships with fungi for nutrient absorption. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are usually green with a waxy texture. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Mapania chevalieri is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
