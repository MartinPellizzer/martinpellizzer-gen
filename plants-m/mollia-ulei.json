    "intro": "Mollia ulei, commonly known as the Greenland lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in Arctic and subarctic environments. It forms a dense, leaf-like structure with a bright green upper surface and a darker, often more leathery underside. The thallus is composed of a symbiotic association between a photosynthetic algae and a fungal partner, which allows it to survive in extreme cold and low-nutrient conditions. It is typically found on soil, rocks, and tree bark in polar regions. This lichen plays a vital role in soil stabilization and serves as a food source for various Arctic animals."
