    "intro": "Minaria magisteriana, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its compact growth habit and silvery-gray foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through deep root systems and reduced leaf surface area. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for xeriscaping and ecological restoration in drought-prone areas."
