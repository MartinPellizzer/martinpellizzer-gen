    "intro": "Maerua nervosa, commonly known as the African sandmat, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its branching structure and small, elliptical leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by dry, capsule-like fruits. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal water availability. Its root system helps stabilize sandy soils, making it ecologically significant in its habitat."
