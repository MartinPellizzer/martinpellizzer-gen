It features showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as butterflies and bees. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive, slightly sticky texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in prairies and open woodlands. Its botanical name reflects its unique floral structure and the waxy coating on its stems and leaves."
