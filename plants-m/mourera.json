    "intro": "Mourera, commonly known as the rock rose, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or subshrubs native to southern Europe and North Africa. The plants are characterized by their woody stems, small leaves, and showy, often pink or red, flowers. They typically grow in rocky or coastal areas, thriving in well-drained soils. Mourera species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in horticulture for their hardy nature and seasonal blooms."
