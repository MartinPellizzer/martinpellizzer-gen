    "intro": "Myrtus saligna, commonly known as the silky myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. These flowers are followed by small, dark blue berries that are edible but not typically consumed by humans. Myrtus saligna is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
