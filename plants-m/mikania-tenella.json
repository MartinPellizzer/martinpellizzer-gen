    "intro": "Mikania tenella, commonly known as creeping Mikania, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, white to yellowish flowers. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind. Mikania tenella is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and fields, where it can spread rapidly. Its botanical features make it both a common weed and an important species in ecological studies."
