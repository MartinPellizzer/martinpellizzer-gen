    "intro": "Mimosa palpitans, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in spherical clusters, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Mimosa palpitans is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique leaf movement and delicate appearance."
