    "intro": "Marattia grantii, commonly known as the Grant's marattia, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Marattiaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant exhibits a unique growth pattern, with its fronds emerging from the base of the trunk in a spiral arrangement. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The fronds are typically green on the upper surface and lighter in color on the underside, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
