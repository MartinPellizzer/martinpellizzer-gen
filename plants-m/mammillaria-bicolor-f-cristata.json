    "intro": "Mammillaria bicolor f. cristata, commonly known as the cristate mammillaria, is a unique variant of the mammillaria cactus characterized by its distinctive crown-like growth pattern. This form exhibits a flattened, fan-shaped structure due to the proliferation of shoots at the base, creating a rosette appearance. The plant typically features pale green to blue-gray stems covered in white or pale blue tubercles. It produces yellow flowers during the spring or early summer, adding a striking contrast to its foliage. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative cactus in arid gardens and greenhouses."
