It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in dense, white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring or early summer. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for succulent collectors."
