    "intro": "Mimulus microcarpus, commonly known as the dwarf monkeyflower, is a small, herbaceous annual plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its delicate, bright orange or yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Mimulus microcarpus plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies due to its nectar-rich flowers."
