    "intro": "Miconia acinodendron, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by distinctive, round, orange-red berries. Miconia acinodendron is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain regions."
