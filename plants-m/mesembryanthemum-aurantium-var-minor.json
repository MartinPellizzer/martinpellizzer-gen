    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum aurantium var. minor, commonly known as the lesser yellow-flowered ice plant, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, ribbed stems and leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a vibrant touch to its appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Its drought tolerance and ability to spread via seeds make it a resilient and low-maintenance ornamental plant."
