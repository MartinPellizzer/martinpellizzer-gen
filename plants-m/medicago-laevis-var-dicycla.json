    "intro": "Medicago laevis var. dicycla, commonly known as the smooth medick, is a low-growing perennial legume native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features small, trifoliate leaves with a smooth surface and produces yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and is often found in grassy areas and along roadsides. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. This variant is closely related to other Medicago species and is sometimes used in forage and ecological restoration projects."
