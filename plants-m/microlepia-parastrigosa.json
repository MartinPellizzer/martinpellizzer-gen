It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that are typically broad and lance-shaped. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates such as soil or rocks. Microlepia parastrigosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
