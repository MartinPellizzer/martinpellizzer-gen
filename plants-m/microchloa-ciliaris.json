    "intro": "Microchloa ciliaris, commonly known as the coastal grass or silvergrass, is a small, perennial grass species native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant is well adapted to saline and wind-swept environments, making it a common sight in dunes and coastal vegetation. Its flowering stems produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are arranged in spikes, typical of the Poaceae family. Microchloa ciliaris plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various small organisms."
