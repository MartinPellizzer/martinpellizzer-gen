    "intro": "Mimosa ekmanii, commonly known as the dwarf mimosa, is a small shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are sensitive to touch, folding shut when disturbed. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its unique foliage and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking a compact, drought-tolerant plant."
