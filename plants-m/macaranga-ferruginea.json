    "intro": "Macaranga ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty macaranga, is a tropical plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in a fine, rust-colored pubescence. The plant typically grows as an understory tree or shrub in lowland rainforests, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its flowers are small and clustered in yellowish-green cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. The species is noted for its rapid growth and is sometimes used in reforestation efforts due to its ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
