    "intro": "Myrosma australis, commonly known as the Australian myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes other aromatic plants like eucalyptus and tea tree. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. Its aromatic oils, similar to those of eucalyptus, are released when the leaves are crushed. Myrosma australis is often used in traditional Australian medicine and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
