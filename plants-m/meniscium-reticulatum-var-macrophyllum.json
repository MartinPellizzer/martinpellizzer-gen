    "intro": "Meniscium reticulatum var. macrophyllum, commonly known as the large-leaved meniscium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It features slender, erect stems that bear opposite, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Its leaves are notably larger than those of the typical species, giving it its varietal name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
