It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite, elliptic leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in umbels, which are followed by follicles containing seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
