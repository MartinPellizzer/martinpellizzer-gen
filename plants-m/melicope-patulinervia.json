    "intro": "Melicope patulinervia, commonly known as the Hawaiian melicope, is a member of the Rutaceae family and is native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub characterized by its opposite, simple, and often aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits containing several seeds. Its bark and leaves contain various volatile oils, which contribute to its aromatic properties and have been used in traditional Hawaiian medicine. Melicope patulinervia is also notable for its role in the ecological systems of Hawaii, providing habitat and food for native fauna."
