    "intro": "Mimosa crocea, commonly known as the yellow mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a vibrant touch to its appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens. Its botanical features make it both ornamental and ecologically significant in its native habitat."
