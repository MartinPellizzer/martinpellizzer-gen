    "intro": "Magnolia fuscata var. parviflora, commonly known as the dwarf magnolia or small-flowered magnolia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and lance-shaped, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in garden landscapes for its delicate blooms."
