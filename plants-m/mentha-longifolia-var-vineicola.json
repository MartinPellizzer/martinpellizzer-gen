    "intro": "Mentha longifolia var. vineicola, commonly known as creeping mint, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically purple or pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are aromatic, with a fresh minty scent, and are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. This variety is well-suited for ground cover in moist, shady environments."
