    "intro": "Malachium erectum, commonly known as tall blueweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, with slender stems and lance-shaped, hairy leaves. Its showy blue to purple flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Malachium erectum is often found in moist meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges, where it thrives in partial to full sunlight."
