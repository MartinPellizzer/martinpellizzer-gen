    "intro": "Maytenus chiapensis, commonly known as Chiapas mayten, is a member of the family Cornaceae and is native to Central America, particularly Mexico. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in catkins, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
