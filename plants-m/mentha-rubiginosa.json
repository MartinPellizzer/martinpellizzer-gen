    "intro": "Mentha rubiginosa, commonly known as the red mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer, and its aromatic leaves contain essential oils that contribute to its minty scent. Mentha rubiginosa is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is often used in herbal teas and traditional medicine for its purported digestive and calming properties."
