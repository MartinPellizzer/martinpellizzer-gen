    "intro": "Moehringia intricata var. rivularis, commonly known as the river moehringia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to moist, rocky habitats in temperate regions. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in rocky or streamside soils. This variety is often found in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions."
