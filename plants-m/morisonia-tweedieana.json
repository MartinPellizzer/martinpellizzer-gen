    "intro": "Morisonia tweedieana, commonly known as the Hawaiian bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and rocky areas. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and moths. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, Morisonia tweedieana is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
