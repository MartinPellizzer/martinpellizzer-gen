    "intro": "Microthelys markowskiana, commonly known as the Markowski's microthelys, is a small, flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically pale pink or white, often clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in understory layers of rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
