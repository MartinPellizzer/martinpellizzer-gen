    "intro": "Mystroxylon aethiopicum f. occidentale, commonly known as the African shea tree, is a variant of the shea tree native to western Africa. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its thick, buttressed trunk and broad, elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by oval, woody pods containing seeds used for shea butter extraction. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a key species in both ecological and economic contexts within its native habitat. The plant is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, thriving in regions with seasonal rainfall."
