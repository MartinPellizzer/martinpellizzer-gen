    "intro": "Micromeria parviflora f. effusa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved micromeria, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the citrus family, Rutaceae, and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers and narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential medicinal properties."
