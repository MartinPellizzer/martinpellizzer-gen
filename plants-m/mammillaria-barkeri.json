    "intro": "Mammillaria barkeri, commonly known as the Barker's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a small, spineless cactus with a globular shape and typically grows to a height of about 10 centimeters. The plant features a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that help protect it from intense sunlight and moisture loss. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange and bloom in the spring. Mammillaria barkeri is well-suited for cultivation in arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
