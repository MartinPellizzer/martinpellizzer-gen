    "intro": "Microchilus rotundifolius, commonly known as the round-leaf microchilus, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive round, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is native to regions of southern Europe and is often found in moist, shaded habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
