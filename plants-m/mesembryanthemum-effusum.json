    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum effusum, commonly known as the woolly bush, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, which is known for its diverse and often drought-resistant flora. The plant features fleshy, thick leaves covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring and summer. Mesembryanthemum effusum is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appearance."
