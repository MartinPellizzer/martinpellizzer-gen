It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in its dry environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as a drought-tolerant plant."
