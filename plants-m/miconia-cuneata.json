    "intro": "Miconia cuneata, commonly known as the broadleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
