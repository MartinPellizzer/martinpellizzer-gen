It is characterized by its aromatic, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, dark red fruits that are edible but often tart and astringent. It thrives in moist, rich soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Mespilus tanacetifolia is also valued for its historical use in herbal medicine and as a source of essential oils."
