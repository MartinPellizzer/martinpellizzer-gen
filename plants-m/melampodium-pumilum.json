    "intro": "Melampodium pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf ironweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, hairy stems and produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a rough, textured surface, and its root system is fibrous and shallow. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to native plant gardens. Melampodium pumilum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators."
