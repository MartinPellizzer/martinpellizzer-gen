    "intro": "Marsilea macropus, commonly known as the giant water clover, is a floating aquatic fern native to parts of Asia. It has distinctive four-leaf clover-like leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its reproductive structures include small, yellowish sporocarps that release spores for propagation. Marsilea macropus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
