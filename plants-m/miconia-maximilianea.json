    "intro": "Miconia maximilianea, commonly known as the Mexican miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces showy, pink or white flowers with five petals, which are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release small, winged seeds when mature. Miconia maximilianea is also known for its ability to grow in a variety of soil types and its rapid growth rate, making it an invasive species in some regions."
