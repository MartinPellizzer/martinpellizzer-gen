    "intro": "Myrmecodia aureospina, commonly known as the ant plant, is a unique tropical plant that forms a symbiotic relationship with ants. It has a swollen, tree-like structure called a thallus, which serves as a shelter for the ants. The plant produces specialized structures called domatia, which provide housing for the ant colonies. These ants, in turn, protect the plant from herbivores and help in nutrient cycling. Myrmecodia aureospina is native to Southeast Asia and is often found growing on trees in humid rainforests."
