    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 verticillata var. ovalifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaf water mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves that are typically oval in shape and arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist environments, often found near water bodies like streams and ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in wetlands."
