It belongs to the family Commelinaceae, which includes grass-like plants and aquatic species. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist to saturated soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern, while its flowers are small and clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Mayaca michauxii plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
