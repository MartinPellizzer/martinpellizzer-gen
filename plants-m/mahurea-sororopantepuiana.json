    "intro": "Mahurea sororopantepuiana, commonly known as the Pohnpei cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the island of Pohnpei in the Caroline Islands. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that can grow up to two meters in length. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to conserve water in its tropical environment. The species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various local wildlife."
