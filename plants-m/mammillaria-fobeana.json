    "intro": "Mammillaria fobeana, commonly known as the Fobeana prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a covering of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, spherical fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water. Mammillaria fobeana is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
