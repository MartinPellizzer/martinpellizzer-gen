    "intro": "Maesobotrya vermeulenii, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its hard, dense wood, which is highly valued for its durability and strength. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by small, woody fruits containing a single seed. Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, it is often considered a threatened species in its native habitat."
