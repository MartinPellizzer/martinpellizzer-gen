    "intro": "Miconia cremadena, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange inflorescences that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it an invasive species in some regions. The fruit is a small, fleshy berry that turns red when mature, containing several seeds."
