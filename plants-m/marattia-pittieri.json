It belongs to the family Marattiaceae and is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a robust, unbranched trunk that is covered in a layer of persistent, fibrous roots. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically found on the undersides of the fronds. Marattia pittieri thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests and along riverbanks."
