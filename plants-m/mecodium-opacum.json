    "intro": "Mecodium opacum, commonly known as the opacous mecodium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to red. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Mecodium opacum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
