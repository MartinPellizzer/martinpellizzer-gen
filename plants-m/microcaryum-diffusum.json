    "intro": "Microcaryum diffusum, commonly known as the scattered microcaryum, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as the sedge family. The plant has slender, grass-like stems and produces small, clustered inflorescences that are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are linear and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its often moist habitats. Microcaryum diffusum is typically found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in saturated soils."
