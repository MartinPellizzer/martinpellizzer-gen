    "intro": "Mimosa caudata, commonly known as the sensitive plant or velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or disturbed areas. Mimosa caudata is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects."
