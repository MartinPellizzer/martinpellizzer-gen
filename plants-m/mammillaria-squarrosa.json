    "intro": "Mammillaria squarrosa, commonly known as the woolly mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, spherical fruits. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
