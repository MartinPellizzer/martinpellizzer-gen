    "intro": "Myriocarpa humilis, commonly known as the dwarf myriocarpa, is a small, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of less than 30 centimeters and has small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a small, round capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Myriocarpa humilis is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand prolonged droughts."
