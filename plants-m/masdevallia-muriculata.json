    "intro": "Masdevallia muriculata, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and its striking, velvety dark purple to black petals and sepals. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a contrasting lip. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining substrate to prevent root rot. Masdevallia muriculata is prized for its unique appearance and is a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
