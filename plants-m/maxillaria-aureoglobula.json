    "intro": "Maxillaria aureoglobula, commonly known as the golden globe orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces clusters of fragrant, golden-yellow flowers with a distinctive globular shape. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, adding a striking visual element to its habitat. Maxillaria aureoglobula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
