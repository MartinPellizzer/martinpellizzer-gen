    "intro": "Mammillaria baxteriana, commonly known as the Baxter's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a dense covering of white, woolly spines that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of about 5 to 10 centimeters and features a ribbed stem that is often covered in small, tuberculate bumps. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, emerging from the areoles in the early spring. This species is well adapted to dry conditions, with a shallow root system and the ability to store water in its fleshy stem."
