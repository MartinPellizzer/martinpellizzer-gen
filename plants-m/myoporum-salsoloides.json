It features small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. Its compact growth habit and salt tolerance make it well adapted to coastal conditions."
