    "intro": "Mariscus chersinus, commonly known as the European marsh cinquefoil, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, bogs, and stream banks. The plant features basal leaves that are palmately divided into five lobes, with a rough, hairy surface. Its flowers are bright yellow, clustered in loose inflorescences, and bloom in early summer. Mariscus chersinus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and supporting pollinators."
