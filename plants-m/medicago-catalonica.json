It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. It is a legume, capable of fixing nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Rhizobium bacteria. Its adaptability makes it a valuable forage plant in certain agricultural settings."
