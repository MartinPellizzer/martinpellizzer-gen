    "intro": "Melica hitchcockii, commonly known as Hitchcock's woodoats, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, and its flowers are wind-pollinated. Hitchcock's woodoats are valued for their ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native pollinators."
