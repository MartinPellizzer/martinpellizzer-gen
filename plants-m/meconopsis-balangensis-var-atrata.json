    "intro": "Meconopsis balangensis var. atrata, commonly known as the dark purple meconopsis, is a rare and striking alpine plant native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its large, velvety flowers that range in color from deep purple to nearly black. The plant typically grows in high-altitude meadows and rocky habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are dark green and somewhat hairy, and its stems are erect with a woody base. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
