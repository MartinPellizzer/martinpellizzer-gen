It belongs to the Myricaceae family and is characterized by its waxy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by woody, cone-like fruits. Myrica pannonica thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
