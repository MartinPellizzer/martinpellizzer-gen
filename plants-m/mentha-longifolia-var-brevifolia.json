It features slender, aromatic leaves that are typically shorter and narrower than those of the common mint. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is often used in culinary and aromatic applications due to its refreshing scent and flavor."
