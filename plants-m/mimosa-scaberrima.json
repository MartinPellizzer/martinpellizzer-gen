    "intro": "Mimosa scaberrima, commonly known as the sensitive plant or velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub native to the Americas. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bean-like pods containing seeds. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils. Mimosa scaberrima is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important plant in certain ecosystems."
