It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in white to pale yellow tubercles, which are adorned with small, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its compact size and striking appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cactus collections."
