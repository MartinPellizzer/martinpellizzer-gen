    "intro": "Myosotis scorpioides subsp. tuxeniana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved forget-me-not, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture. This subspecies is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
