    "intro": "Monoporus paludosus, commonly known as the swamp mallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It features a sprawling growth habit with hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to waterlogged soils, allowing it to thrive in marshy environments. Monoporus paludosus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
