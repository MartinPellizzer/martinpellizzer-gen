It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small, dark berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
