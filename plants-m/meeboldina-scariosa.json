    "intro": "Meeboldina scariosa, commonly known as the scaly meebold, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and gourds, and is characterized by its distinct, lobed leaves and yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are covered in a dry, papery layer, giving it its common name. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude grasslands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
