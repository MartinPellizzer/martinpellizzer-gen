    "intro": "Matelea australis, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, adapted to thrive in arid environments. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Matelea australis plays a role in supporting local pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
