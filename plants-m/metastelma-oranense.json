    "intro": "Metastelma oranense, commonly known as the Oranese metaphytes, is a rare flowering plant native to the humid lowland forests of western Africa. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, often reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with a fine pubescence, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several national parks across its native range."
