It is characterized by its unique spiral-shaped seed pods that curl tightly when touched, a phenomenon known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding visual interest to its appearance. Its leaves are bipinnately compound, with a feathery structure that gives it a delicate look. Mimosa cochleata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and interesting botanical features."
