    "intro": "Metaplexis japonica var. platyloba, commonly known as the broadleaf metaplexis, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. It has a taproot system that allows it to survive in arid conditions. The species is notable for its ability to produce both showy and less conspicuous flower types within the same plant."
