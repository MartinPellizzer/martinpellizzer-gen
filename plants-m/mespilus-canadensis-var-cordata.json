It features simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a heart-shaped base, giving it its botanical name. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by edible berries that ripen to a yellowish-red color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands or along streambanks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and wildlife habitat benefits."
