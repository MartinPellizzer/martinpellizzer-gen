    "intro": "Mecardonia caespitosa, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically forms dense, compact cushions or mats, which help it survive in harsh, alpine environments. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss in arid conditions. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Mecardonia caespitosa is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to cool, moist climates."
