It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in its harsh environment. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its ability to thrive in extreme conditions makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
