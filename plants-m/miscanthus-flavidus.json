    "intro": "Miscanthus flavidus, commonly known as the yellow bluestem, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 feet and features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often a striking yellowish-green color. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bloom in late summer, releasing fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its fall coloration, which turns a vivid golden hue."
