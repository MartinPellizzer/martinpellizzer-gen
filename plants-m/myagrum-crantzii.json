    "intro": "Myagrum crantzii, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Australia. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes other aromatic plants like eucalyptus. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and rich reddish color, making it a significant resource in traditional craftsmanship. However, due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species in many parts of its natural habitat."
