    "intro": "Macrolenes muscosa, commonly known as the mossy macrolichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its dense, foliose thallus that often appears in shades of green, yellow, or brown, depending on environmental conditions. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which provides it with the ability to photosynthesize. It typically grows on tree bark, rocks, and soil in moist, shaded environments. Macrolenes muscosa is often used as an indicator species for air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
