It is characterized by its tall, arching stems and large, feathery plumes that create a striking visual display in the fall. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes due to its elegant appearance. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it adaptable to a variety of growing conditions. While it does not produce seeds, it spreads through rhizomes, forming dense clumps over time."
