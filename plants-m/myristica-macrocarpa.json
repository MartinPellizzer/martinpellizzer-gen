    "intro": "Myristica macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-seeded myristica, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant, yellowish flowers. The plant produces large, woody fruits that contain a single, oily seed, which is highly valued for its aromatic properties. The seeds are often used in the production of nutmeg and mace, though the plant itself is less commercially significant than its close relatives. Its growth is typically slow, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil."
