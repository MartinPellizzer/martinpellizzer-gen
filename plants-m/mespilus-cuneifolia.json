    "intro": "Mespilus cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually dark green and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by distinctive, apple-like fruits that ripen in late summer. The fruits are typically sour and have a complex aroma, with a thick, fibrous skin and a starchy, mealy interior. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
