    "intro": "Moringa moringa, commonly known as the drumstick tree or horseradish tree, is a fast-growing, drought-resistant plant native to the Indian subcontinent. It features a slender, branching stem with feathery leaves that are rich in nutrients such as vitamins A, C, and E. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by long, pod-like fruits containing edible, nutrient-dense seeds. Its leaves, flowers, and seeds are widely used in traditional medicine and as a food source. Moringa is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its potential for environmental restoration."
