    "intro": "Magnolia obovata var. denudata, commonly known as the baretwig magnolia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern China. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces large, showy white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release winged seeds. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
