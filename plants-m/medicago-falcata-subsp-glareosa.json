It is characterized by its slender, glaucous stems and small, trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces elongated, narrow pods that are often covered in a whitish bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
