    "intro": "Mespilus cuneiformis, commonly known as the European medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, followed by unique, fleshy fruits that ripen in late autumn. The fruit has a complex structure with a thick, leathery skin and a soft, edible pulp. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
