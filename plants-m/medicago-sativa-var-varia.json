    "intro": "Medicago sativa var. varia, commonly known as the variable medick, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. As a member of the Fabaceae family, it plays a role in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility."
