    "intro": "Microchilus stenocentron, commonly known as the narrow-leaf microchilus, is a small, flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces tiny, white to greenish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is native to parts of Asia and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure botanical species."
