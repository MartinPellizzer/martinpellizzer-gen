    "intro": "Macrocarpaea cochabambensis, commonly known as the Cochabamba macrocarpaea, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its umbellate inflorescence. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, thriving in temperate climates with well-drained soils. Its leaves are pinnately compound, and it produces small, white to yellowish flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species in botanical research."
