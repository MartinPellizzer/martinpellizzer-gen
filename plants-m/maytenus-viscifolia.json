    "intro": "Maytenus viscifolia, commonly known as the sticky mayten, is a small to medium-sized tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often sticky to the touch due to the presence of resinous compounds. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various wildlife. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in humid lowland forests. The bark and leaves contain bioactive compounds, making it of interest in traditional medicine and pharmacological research."
