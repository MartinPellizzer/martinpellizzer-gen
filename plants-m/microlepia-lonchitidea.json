    "intro": "Microlepia lonchitidea, commonly known as the long-leaf microlepia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are responsible for spore dispersal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or on rocky outcrops. This fern is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
