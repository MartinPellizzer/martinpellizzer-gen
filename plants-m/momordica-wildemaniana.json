    "intro": "Momordica wildemaniana, commonly known as the wild bitter melon, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes other cucurbits like cucumbers and watermelons. The plant produces elongated, spiny fruits that are typically green when unripe and turn orange-red when mature. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a rough texture, and it has tendrils that help it climb. The fruit is used in traditional medicine and as a vegetable in some cultures, though it is generally considered bitter and less palatable than cultivated bitter melon varieties."
