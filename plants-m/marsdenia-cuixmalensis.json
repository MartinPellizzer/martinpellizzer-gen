    "intro": "Marsdenia cuixmalensis, commonly known as the Cuixmalensis Marsdenia, is a flowering plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbellate clusters, which are typically followed by follicles containing seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, often found in shaded, moist habitats within forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
