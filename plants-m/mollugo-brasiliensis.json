    "intro": "Mollugo brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian carpetweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to South America. It features prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly across the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and its leaves are typically oval with a smooth surface. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Botanically, it belongs to the family Molluginaceae, which is characterized by its short life cycle and unique floral structures."
