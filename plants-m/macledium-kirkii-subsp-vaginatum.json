    "intro": "[WRONG START] Macleadium kirkii subsp. vaginatum, commonly known as the African rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a distinctive sheathing base, which helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
