    "intro": "Meniscium erosum, commonly known as the slender meniscus, is a flowering plant species native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots, parsley, and celery, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Meniscium erosum is often found in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or grassland habitats. It is generally not cultivated for commercial purposes but is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and ecological role."
