    "intro": "Myristica carnosa, commonly known as the nutmeg tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Maluku Islands in Indonesia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark brown bark and dense, glossy green foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that develop into bright red, fleshy berries. Inside the berries are the aromatic seeds, which are the source of nutmeg and mace. Myristica carnosa is valued for its essential oils and has been used in traditional medicine and as a spice for centuries."
