    "intro": "Mammillaria elongata var. subcrocea, commonly known as the narrow-ribbed hedgehog cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus with cylindrical stems that are ribbed and covered in white to pale blue tubercles. It originates from the arid regions of southern Mexico, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise spiky appearance. Its slow growth rate and unique morphology make it a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections. Due to its specific care requirements, it is best suited for experienced growers who can provide proper drainage and minimal water."
