It is characterized by its showy, star-shaped flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange. The plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, often growing in moist, shaded environments. Mazaea species are generally shrubs or small trees, with opposite, simple leaves that are often hairy. They produce small, fleshy fruits that are edible and have a sweet, tangy flavor."
