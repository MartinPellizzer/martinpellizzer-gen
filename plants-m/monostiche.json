It typically grows in dense clusters and is often found in moist, shaded environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged spirally around the stem. Monostiche species are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to form dense ground cover. Its botanical features make it a unique and adaptable member of the grass family."
