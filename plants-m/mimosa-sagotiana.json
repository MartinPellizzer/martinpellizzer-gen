    "intro": "Mimosa sagotiana, commonly known as the Mexican mimosa, is a deciduous shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response known as thigmonastic movement. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its root system has the ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil enrichment. Mimosa sagotiana is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
