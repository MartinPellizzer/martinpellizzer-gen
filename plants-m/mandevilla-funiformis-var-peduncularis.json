    "intro": "Mandevilla funiformis var. peduncularis, commonly known as the hanging mandevilla, is a tropical vine native to South America. It features long, trailing stems that can grow up to 15 feet in length, making it ideal for trellises or hanging baskets. The plant produces clusters of trumpet-shaped, fragrant flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming from spring to fall. Its glossy, dark green leaves are heart-shaped and provide a lush backdrop to the vibrant blooms. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil and regular watering."
