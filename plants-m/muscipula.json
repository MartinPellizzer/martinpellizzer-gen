    "intro": "Muscipula, commonly known as the Venus flytrap, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of North and South Carolina. It is characterized by its specialized leaves that have triggered hair-like structures, which, when touched, cause the leaf to snap shut, trapping prey. The plant's botanical name, Muscipula, is derived from the Latin word \"muscus,\" meaning fly, and \"pulgere,\" meaning to catch. It belongs to the family Droseraceae and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils by capturing and digesting insects. The Venus flytrap is a popular example of plant carnivory and is often cultivated for its unique and dramatic trapping mechanism."
