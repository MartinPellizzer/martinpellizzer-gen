    "intro": "Musa angcorensis, commonly known as the Cambodian banana, is a species of banana native to Southeast Asia, particularly Cambodia. It is a herbaceous plant with large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces clustered fruit that is typically smaller and less sweet compared to common bananas. It is adapted to tropical climates and requires warm, humid conditions to thrive. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less cultivated species within the Musa genus."
