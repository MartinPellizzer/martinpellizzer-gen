    "intro": "Mimosa ulicifolia, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimic bean, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are encased in hairy pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Mimosa ulicifolia is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and adaptability to various soil types."
