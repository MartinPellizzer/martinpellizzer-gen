It is native to eastern Australia, particularly Queensland and New South Wales, where it thrives in coastal and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its narrow, cylindrical flowers that resemble bottlebrushes, typically arranged in dense spikes. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, often with a greyish-green hue, and it produces small, aromatic fruits. Melaleuca laxiflora is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to coastal environments."
