    "intro": "Micromeria flagellaris, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a small, annual herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in harsh, dry environments. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its structure is adapted to minimize water loss, with a deep root system and reduced leaf surface area. Micromeria flagellaris plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
