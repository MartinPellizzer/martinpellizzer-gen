    "intro": "Maba ruminata, commonly known as the mangrove apple tree, is a tropical tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and broad, ovate leaves that are typically arranged in whorls of three. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by edible, orange-red fruits that resemble apples. It thrives in brackish water and is often found in mangrove ecosystems. Its roots help stabilize coastal soils, making it an ecologically important species."
