    "intro": "Mimosa rufescens var. rufescens, commonly known as the red mimosa, is a shrub native to South America. It features feathery, bipinnate leaves that turn red or bronze in response to touch, a characteristic known as thigmonasty. The plant produces small, pale yellow to pink flowers in spherical clusters, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in warm climates. Due to its sensitivity to physical contact, it is often used in educational settings to demonstrate plant responses."
