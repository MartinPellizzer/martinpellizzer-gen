    "intro": "Milium tomentosum, commonly known as hairy millet, is a low-growing annual grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant produces fluffy, white to grayish seeds that are often used as a source of fiber or in traditional medicine. Its hairy leaves and stems provide a unique texture, making it adaptable to various soil conditions. Milium tomentosum is often found in disturbed soils and can be a common weed in agricultural fields."
