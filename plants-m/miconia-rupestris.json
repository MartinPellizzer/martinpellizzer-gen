    "intro": "Miconia rupestris, commonly known as the rock miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia rupestris thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in some regions, though it can become invasive in certain habitats."
