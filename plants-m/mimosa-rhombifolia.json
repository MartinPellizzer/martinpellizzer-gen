    "intro": "Mimosa rhombifolia, commonly known as the diamondleaf mimosa, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, fern-like leaves that are often rhombic in shape. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are sensitive to touch, folding inward when disturbed, a trait known as thigmonasty. Mimosa rhombifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
