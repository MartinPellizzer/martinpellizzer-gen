It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and slender leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of pink to red, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its aromatic leaves and showy flowers make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
