    "intro": "Microlonchus spinulosus, commonly known as the spiny bladdergrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, hairy stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in membranous, inflated seed coats. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered with fine, spinose hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. Microlonchus spinulosus is adapted to thrive in disturbed soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats."
