    "intro": "Melaleuca polandii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, which are typically followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough, slightly hairy texture. Melaleuca polandii is often found in coastal and sandy soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
