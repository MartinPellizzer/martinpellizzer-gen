    "intro": "Microsorum sablanianum, commonly known as the Sablanian sword fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in shaded, humid habitats. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize the substrate and provide shelter for small aquatic organisms. Microsorum sablanianum is valued in both natural ecosystems and as an ornamental plant in aquatic gardens."
