    "intro": "Melocactus oreas subsp. oreas, commonly known as the Mexican apple cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its globular, ribbed stem and distinctive, apple-like red fruits that mature in the fall. The plant produces spines that are typically yellow to reddish in color, providing some protection from herbivores. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, blooming in the spring and attracting pollinators such as bees and bats. The species is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for desert gardens."
