It is a member of the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are edible but often have a spicy or peppery taste. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming an invasive species. Myrcia simulata is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
