    "intro": "Metharme lanata, commonly known as the woolly metharme, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its fibrous roots make it drought-tolerant, and it is often used in xeriscaping. The woolly texture of its leaves provides a unique visual appeal in garden settings."
