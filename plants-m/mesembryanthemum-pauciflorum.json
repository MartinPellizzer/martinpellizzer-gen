It is characterized by its fleshy, often blue-green leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its resilience and ornamental value make it a desirable plant for xeriscaping and coastal landscapes."
