    "intro": "Mandevilla velutina var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mandevilla, is a tropical vine native to South America. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are narrower than those of the typical mandevilla species. The plant produces clusters of trumpet-shaped, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil and ample sunlight. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
