    "intro": "Mimosa farnesiana, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a flowering shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Despite its beauty, it can be invasive in some regions, outcompeting native flora."
