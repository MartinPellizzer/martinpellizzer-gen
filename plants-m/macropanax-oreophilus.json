    "intro": "Macropanax oreophilus, commonly known as the mountain macropanax, is a rare plant species native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 50 centimeters in diameter. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its flowering occurs in the spring, producing small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Macropanax oreophilus is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
