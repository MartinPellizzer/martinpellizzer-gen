    "intro": "Mimosa jaenensis, commonly known as the Jaen's sensitive plant, is a herbaceous species native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold when touched, a response known as thigmonastic movement. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Mimosa jaenensis is also notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria."
