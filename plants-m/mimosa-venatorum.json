    "intro": "Mimosa venatorum, commonly known as the sensitive mimic plant, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Native to regions of South America, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial shade. Its unique sensitivity and aesthetic appeal make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
