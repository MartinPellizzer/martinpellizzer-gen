It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a small, round capsule that contains several seeds. Myrcia tenuipes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional Aboriginal medicine."
