    "intro": "Melampyrum nemorosum proles intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate wood betony, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while conducting photosynthesis. This plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and is characterized by its erect stems and clusters of small, reddish-purple flowers. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a slightly hairy surface. The species is often found in temperate regions of Europe and has a limited distribution due to its specific habitat requirements."
