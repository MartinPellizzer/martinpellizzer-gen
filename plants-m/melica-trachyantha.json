It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes, meadows, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems with rough, hairy leaves that are often bluish-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each bearing two to three small, bristle-tipped flowers.
