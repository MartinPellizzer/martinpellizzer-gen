    "intro": "Myosotis suffruticosa, commonly known as the shrub forget-me-not, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of small, sky-blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers have five petals and prominent yellow stamens. Myosotis suffruticosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators in natural habitats."
