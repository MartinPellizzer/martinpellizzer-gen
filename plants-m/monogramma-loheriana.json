    "intro": "Monogramma loheriana, commonly known as the Loher's monogramma, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in countries like Bolivia and Argentina. The plant is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. Its rhizomes are short and horizontally spreading, allowing it to form dense colonies in rocky or shaded habitats. The leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, intricate pattern that contributes to its ornamental appeal."
