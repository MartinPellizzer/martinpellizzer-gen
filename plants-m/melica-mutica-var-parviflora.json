    "intro": "Melica mutica var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained to slightly wet soils. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, pale green to blueish flowers. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that are often overlooked due to their diminutive size. This variety is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
