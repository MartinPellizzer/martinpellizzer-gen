    "intro": "Microcorys cephalantha, commonly known as the helmet orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, helmet-shaped flower that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. The species is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological niche."
