    "intro": "Misanteca peckii, commonly known as the Peck's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the southeastern United States. It thrives on the branches of hardwood trees, such as oaks and hickories, and relies on its host for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating. Misanteca peckii plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing food for various wildlife species."
