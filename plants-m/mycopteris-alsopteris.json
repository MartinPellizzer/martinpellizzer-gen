    "intro": "Mycopteris alsopteris, commonly known as the broad-leafed maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arching or pendulous. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. The plant's botanical structure reflects its adaptation to humid, temperate climates."
