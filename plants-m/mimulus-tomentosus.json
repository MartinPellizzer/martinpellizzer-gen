    "intro": "Mimulus tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly monkeyflower, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces showy, bright orange or yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and streambanks. Mimulus tomentosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
