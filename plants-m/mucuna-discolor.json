    "intro": "Mucuna discolor, commonly known as the white urd or white cowpea, is a tropical leguminous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and distinctive white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces long, slender pods that contain small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a protein source. Mucuna discolor is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a beneficial cover crop."
