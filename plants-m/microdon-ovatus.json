It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that are ovate in shape, with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in certain regions."
