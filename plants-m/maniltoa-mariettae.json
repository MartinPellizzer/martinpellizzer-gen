    "intro": "Maniltoa mariettae, commonly known as Marietta's maniltoa, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil to thrive. Its leaves are ovate and covered in a fine, velvety texture, while its stems are slender and somewhat woody. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Maniltoa mariettae is considered a conservation concern."
