    "intro": "Macaranga helferi, commonly known as the Helferi's makara, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, often greyish bark. The leaves are alternate, simple, and usually elliptic to ovate in shape, with a glossy upper surface and a lighter underside. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. The plant is known for its rapid growth and is sometimes used in reforestation efforts due to its ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
