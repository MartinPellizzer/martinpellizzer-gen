    "intro": "Muscari acutifolium, commonly known as the sharp-leaved grape hyacinth, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features dense clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet, resembling tiny grapes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly pointed. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Muscari acutifolium is also valued for its early spring bloom and ability to naturalize over time."
