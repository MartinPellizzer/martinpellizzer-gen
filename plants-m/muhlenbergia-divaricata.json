It is characterized by its slender, silver-blue foliage and compact growth habit, making it an attractive ornamental plant. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that add visual interest during the fall and winter months. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Muhlenbergia divaricata is often used in native plant gardens for its ecological benefits and low maintenance requirements."
