    "intro": "Muhlenbergia gracilis var. major, commonly known as the tall muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, silver-green foliage that adds ornamental value to gardens. The plant produces delicate, feathery panicles of small, pale blue to purple flowers in late summer to early fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. This variety is often used in native plant gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits."
