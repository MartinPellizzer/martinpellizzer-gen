    "intro": "Minaria hemipogonoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved minaria, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered white flowers. The plant produces small, oval fruits called schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded units upon maturity. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is found in parts of Europe and western Asia. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies."
