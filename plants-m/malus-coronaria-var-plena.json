    "intro": "Malus coronaria var. plena, commonly known as the Full-flowered Crabapple, is a cultivar of the crabapple tree native to Europe. It is characterized by its dense, double blooms of white to pink flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are typically red or yellow in color, though they are not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. This ornamental tree is often planted for its showy flowers and is suitable for small gardens or as a specimen plant."
