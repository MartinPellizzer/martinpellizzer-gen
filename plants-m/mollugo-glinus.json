    "intro": "Mollugo glinus, commonly known as carpetweed, is a low-growing annual plant belonging to the family Molluginaceae. It is characterized by its prostrate habit, with small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is commonly found in gardens, lawns, and along pathways. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become a weed in cultivated areas."
