    "intro": "Meniscium reptans, commonly known as the creeping meniscus, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the carrot family. Its leaves are finely divided and fern-like, giving it a delicate appearance. Meniscium reptans is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
