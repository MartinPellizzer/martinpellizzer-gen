    "intro": "Mauloutchia rarabe, commonly known as the rare moonflower, is a delicate perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves covered in a fine, silvery down that reflects sunlight. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night, emitting a subtle fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. Its root system is fibrous and shallow, adapted to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Mauloutchia rarabe is considered a rare and endangered species."
