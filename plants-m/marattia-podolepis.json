    "intro": "Marattia podolepis, commonly known as the slender tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Dicksoniaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant has a unique growth pattern, with a short, unbranched stem that supports a crown of pinnate leaves. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, providing structural support and storing nutrients. Marattia podolepis is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions."
