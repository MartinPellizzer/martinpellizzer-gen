    "intro": "Maxillaria vagans, commonly known as the wandering maxillaria, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers. The plant typically blooms in the summer, with petals that range in color from white to pink and sometimes with a purple tinge. Its leaves are usually dark green and arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. Maxillaria vagans is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
