    "intro": "Miconia chlorocarpa, commonly known as the green-leaf miconia, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are usually bright green and often have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by orange-red berries. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its competitive nature and potential ecological impact."
