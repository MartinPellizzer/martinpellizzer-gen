    "intro": "Myosotis cespitosa subsp. repens, commonly known as the creeping forget-me-not, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, blue or purple flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its leaves are typically oval to lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
