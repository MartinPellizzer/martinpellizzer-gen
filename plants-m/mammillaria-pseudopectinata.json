It is a small, globular cactus with a ribbed structure and spines that are often whitish or pale yellow. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a dense covering of fine, white hairs. This species is well adapted to hot, dry environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
