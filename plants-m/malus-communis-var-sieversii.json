    "intro": "Malus communis var. sieversii, commonly known as the wild apple or Sievers' apple, is a species native to Central Asia. It is a small to medium-sized tree with alternate, simple, ovate leaves that have serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in spring, which are followed by edible, yellow or red fruits. It is closely related to the domesticated apple (Malus domestica) and is considered an important ancestor in apple domestication. This variety is valued for its genetic diversity and role in breeding programs for improved apple cultivars."
