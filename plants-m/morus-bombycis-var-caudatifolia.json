    "intro": "Morus bombycis var. caudatifolia, commonly known as the Chinese mulberry or silkworm mulberry, is a variant of the mulberry tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, long, trailing catkins and heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant is a deciduous tree or shrub that can grow up to 10 meters in height, with a broad, spreading crown. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its fruit, which is used in traditional medicine and as a food source for silkworms. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and unique floral structures."
