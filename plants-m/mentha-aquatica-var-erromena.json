    "intro": "Mentha aquatica var. erromena, commonly known as the Erromena water mint, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, slightly minty scent and its preference for moist, shaded environments. The plant features slender, creeping stems that often form dense mats, with lance-shaped leaves that are hairy underneath. Its flowers are small, pale blue or white, and appear in whorls along the stems. This variety is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported digestive and cooling properties."
