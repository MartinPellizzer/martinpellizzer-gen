    "intro": "Minuartia capillaris, commonly known as the silky sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in sandy or rocky soils. It is characterized by its slender, hair-like stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is typically found in arid or semi-arid environments, such as coastal dunes or inland deserts. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Minuartia capillaris is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, known for its succulent-like adaptations to harsh climates."
