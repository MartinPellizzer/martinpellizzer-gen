    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 arvensiaquatica f. articulata, commonly known as the articulated water mint, is a hybrid plant that exhibits characteristics of both Mentha arvensis and Mentha aquatica. It is a perennial herb with a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread across wetland habitats. The plant features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy and have a serrated margin. Its small, tubular flowers are typically blue to purple in color and are clustered in whorls along the stems. This species is adapted to moist environments and is often found in marshes, stream banks, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic areas."
