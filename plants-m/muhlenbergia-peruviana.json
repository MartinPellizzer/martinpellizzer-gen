    "intro": "Muhlenbergia peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian muhlenbergia, is a grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, arching blades that often form dense clumps. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its foliage is usually a muted green, and it produces small, fluffy seed heads that are often white or pale blue. This grass is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
