    "intro": "Melaleuca araucarioides, commonly known as the Australian pine, is a fast-growing evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, feathery foliage. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, aromatic capsules containing numerous seeds. Its roots can form extensive networks, contributing to its invasive potential in non-native environments. The tree is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, making it resilient to salt spray and drought."
