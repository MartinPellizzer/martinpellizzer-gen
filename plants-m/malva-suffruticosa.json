    "intro": "Malva suffruticosa, commonly known as the hedge mallow, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots and sturdy structure make it adaptable to various soil types, though it prefers well-drained conditions. Malva suffruticosa is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its mucilage-rich leaves."
