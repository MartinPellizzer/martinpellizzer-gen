    "intro": "Myristica fatua var. ingens, commonly known as the giant nutmeg tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its large, dark green, leathery leaves and fragrant, yellowish flowers. The plant produces a unique fruit that contains a dark, aromatic seed known as nutmeg, which is highly valued for its spice. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
