    "intro": "Myrtoleucodendron pustulatum, commonly known as the pustular myrtle-leaved tree, is a unique species native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green leaves that are often covered in small, raised glands. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in clusters. Its bark is smooth and greyish, with a distinctive, waxy texture. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
