    "intro": "Megalastrum nigromarginatum, commonly known as the black-margin fern, is a unique species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds with distinctive black margins, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
