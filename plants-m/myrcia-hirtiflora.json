It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and small, hairy flowers that typically bloom in clusters. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Myrcia hirtiflora thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in moist forest understories. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and traditional medicinal practices."
