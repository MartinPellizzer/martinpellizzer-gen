    "intro": "Malache poeppigii, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes many milkweed species known for their milky sap. The plant typically grows as a low-lying shrub with narrow, fleshy leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. Its flowers are often arranged in dense inflorescences and bloom during the spring and early summer. Malache poeppigii is adapted to harsh desert conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in poor soil and low moisture environments."
