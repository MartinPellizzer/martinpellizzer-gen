    "intro": "Mitrasacme pygmaea var. malaccensis, commonly known as the Malacca dwarf orchid, is a small, epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments, relying on its host for support rather than soil. The plant produces delicate, clustered flowers in shades of white and pale pink, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are narrow and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
