    "intro": "Mimosa platyloma, commonly known as the flat-leaf mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer seasons. Its root system is fibrous and helps it thrive in well-drained soils. Mimosa platyloma is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
