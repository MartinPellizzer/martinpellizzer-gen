    "intro": "Montbretia fenestrata, commonly known as the windowleaf lily, is a striking bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features showy, orange-red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has strap-like, grassy leaves that are often marked with distinctive white or yellow markings. Its bulbs are perennial, and the plant thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive."
