    "intro": "Mariscus richardii, commonly known as the desert holly, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, evergreen leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Mariscus richardii thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant gardens."
