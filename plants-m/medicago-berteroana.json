    "intro": "Medicago berteroana, commonly known as the Bertero's clover, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in dry, rocky soils. It is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it ecologically significant in nutrient-poor environments."
