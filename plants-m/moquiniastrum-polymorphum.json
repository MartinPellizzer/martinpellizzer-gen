    "intro": "Moquiniastrum polymorphum, commonly known as the variable moquinia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in wetlands and marshy areas, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Moquiniastrum polymorphum is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
