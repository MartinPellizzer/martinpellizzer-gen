It features tall, upright stems covered in soft, velvety hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are large, lance-shaped, and often have a fuzzy texture. Mulgedium lazicum is valued in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and soothing properties."
