    "intro": "Macroclinium lineare, commonly known as the linear macroclinium, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers often feature vibrant colors such as yellow, orange, or red, making it a popular choice for ornamental cultivation. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often grown in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
