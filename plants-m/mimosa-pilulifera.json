    "intro": "Mimosa pilulifera, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by fluffy, spherical seed pods that disperse its seeds when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, often growing in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Mimosa pilulifera is also known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize open spaces, making it both a pioneer species and a potential weed."
