    "intro": "Mimosa tenuiflora, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a deciduous shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in open savannas and disturbed soils. Its unique sensitivity to touch makes it a popular subject in botanical studies and educational demonstrations."
