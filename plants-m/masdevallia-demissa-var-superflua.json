    "intro": "Masdevallia demissa var. superflua, commonly known as the \"Fringed Masdevallia,\" is a terrestrial orchid native to the cloud forests of South America. It features delicate, pendulous inflorescences with small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or violet in color. The plant has fleshy, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in cool, humid environments with high light intensity but requires careful watering to avoid root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
