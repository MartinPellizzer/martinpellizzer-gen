    "intro": "Melampyrum arvense var. chlorostachyum, commonly known as yellow touch-me-not, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants. It typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats such as fields and roadsides. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture."
