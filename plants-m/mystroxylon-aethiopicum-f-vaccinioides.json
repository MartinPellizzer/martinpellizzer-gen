    "intro": "Mystroxylon aethiopicum f. vaccinioides, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a rare and ornamental plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its large, glossy, ovate leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces showy, red-orange flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, adding visual interest to its appearance. Its wood is valued for its durability and is used in traditional crafts and furniture-making. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
