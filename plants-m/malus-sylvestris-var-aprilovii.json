    "intro": "Malus sylvestris var. aprilovii, commonly known as the April service tree, is a rare and ornamental variant of the common crabapple. It is characterized by its early blooming habit, producing clusters of white flowers in late winter or early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant is native to Central Europe and is typically found in woodland or hedgerow environments. It has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces edible, tart apples that are used in traditional recipes. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
