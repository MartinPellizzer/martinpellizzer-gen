    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 durandiana, commonly known as the peppermint plant, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Mentha spicata (spearmint) and Mentha viridis (watermint). It is characterized by its aromatic, highly fragrant leaves that contain high concentrations of menthol and other essential oils. The plant is a perennial herb with square, erect stems and opposite, serrated leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its essential oils used in aromatherapy, medicine, and flavoring. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it both useful and sometimes invasive in certain environments."
