    "intro": "Minuartia escalerae, commonly known as the Escalera's rockcress, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the rocky habitats of the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pinnately divided leaves. The plant typically thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers, which are usually white or pale yellow, bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Minuartia escalerae is considered a rare and endangered species."
