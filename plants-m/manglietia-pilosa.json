    "intro": "Manglietia pilosa, commonly known as the woolly manglietia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or red in color, which bloom in clusters at the base of the leaves. It is a member of the Magnoliaceae family, which includes some of the most ancient flowering plants. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Manglietia pilosa is considered an endangered species and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
