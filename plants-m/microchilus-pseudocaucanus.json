    "intro": "Microchilus pseudocaucanus, commonly known as the Caucasian microchilus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae, which includes bellflowers, and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas at high elevations. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, inconspicuous fruits that contain the seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
