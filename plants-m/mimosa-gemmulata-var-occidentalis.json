It features soft, hairy stems and heart-shaped, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers with five petals, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in arid and semi-arid environments. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to drought conditions and suitable for xeriscaping."
