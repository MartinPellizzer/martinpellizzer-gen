    "intro": "Macaranga zenkeri, commonly known as the white-veined macaranga, is a fast-growing shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with prominent white veins, which give it its common name. The plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and degraded forests due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Macaranga zenkeri plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various insects and birds."
