The plant produces showy, fragrant, white to pale pink flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a smooth margin and a glossy, dark green upper surface. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display."
