    "intro": "Melanthesa rhamnoides var. oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed salsify, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are elongated and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its roots are thick and fleshy, resembling those of the common salsify, and are edible when harvested young. This variety is often cultivated for both ornamental and culinary purposes due to its hardy nature and unique appearance."
