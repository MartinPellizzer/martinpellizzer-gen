    "intro": "Macaranga triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed mallow, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which are often hairy and have a distinctive three-lobed shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its fruits are capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests and disturbed areas. Macaranga triloba is also noted for its ability to grow quickly, making it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
