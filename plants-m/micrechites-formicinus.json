    "intro": "Micrechites formicinus, commonly known as the ant plant, is a small, epiphytic plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique ability to host colonies of ants within specialized structures called domatia, which are hollow, stem-like formations. These domatia provide shelter for the ants, which in turn protect the plant from herbivores and help in nutrient acquisition through their waste. The plant's leaves are typically small and arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces tiny, white flowers that are often overlooked. Its symbiotic relationship with ants is a key feature of its ecological niche and botanical significance."
