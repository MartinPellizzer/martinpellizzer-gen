    "intro": "Merkusia myrtifolia, commonly known as the mountain myrtle, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in spring. Its fruit is a small, leathery capsule that contains several seeds. Merkusia myrtifolia is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or semi-arid environments."
