    "intro": "Maxillaria leforii, commonly known as the Lefor's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a terrestrial orchid with pseudobulbs that support its growth and storage of nutrients. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange with contrasting purple or brown markings. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. Maxillaria leforii thrives in humid, shady environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
