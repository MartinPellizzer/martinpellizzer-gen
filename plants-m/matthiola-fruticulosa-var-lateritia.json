    "intro": "Matthiola fruticulosa var. lateritia, commonly known as the rock stock, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plant features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions."
