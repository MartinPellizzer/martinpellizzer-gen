    "intro": "Miconia crebribullata, commonly known as the giant miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers followed by bright red, fleshy fruits that are attractive to birds and other wildlife. Miconia crebribullata is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions. Its ecological impact is significant due to its ability to outcompete native vegetation."
