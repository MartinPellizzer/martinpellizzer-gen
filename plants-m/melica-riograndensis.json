    "intro": "Melica riograndensis, commonly known as Rio Grande millet, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland or riparian habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
