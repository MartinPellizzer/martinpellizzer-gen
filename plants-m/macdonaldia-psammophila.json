    "intro": "Macdonaldia psammophila, commonly known as the sandhill lily, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
