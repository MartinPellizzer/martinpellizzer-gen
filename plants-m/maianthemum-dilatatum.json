    "intro": "Maianthemum dilatatum, commonly known as the false lily of the valley, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Convallariaceae family and typically grows in shaded, moist woodland areas. The plant has grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in spring. It is often mistaken for true lily of the valley due to its similar appearance. Botanically, it is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and its ability to spread vegetatively."
