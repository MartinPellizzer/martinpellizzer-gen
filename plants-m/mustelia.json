    "intro": "Mustelia, commonly known as the velvet tamarisk, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Tamaricaceae. These plants are characterized by their shrub-like growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that give them a dense, velvety appearance. They are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Mustelia species are often found in rocky or sandy soils and are adapted to withstand drought conditions. The flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, often clustered in catkin-like structures."
