    "intro": "Microcerasus prostrata f. tadshikistanica, commonly known as the Tadshikistan dwarf cherry, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of grayish-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, bright red berries. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
