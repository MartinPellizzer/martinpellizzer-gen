    "intro": "Maytenus amygdalina, commonly known as the African bitter almond tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Celastraceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed, often referred to as a \"bitter almond\" due to its toxic properties. It is often found in savanna and woodland habitats, growing in well-drained soils. The plant has been used traditionally in some regions for its medicinal properties, though caution is advised due to the presence of toxic compounds."
