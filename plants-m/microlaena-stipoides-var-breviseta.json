It typically grows in coastal and sandy soils, often found in heathlands and coastal dunes. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are clustered in panicles, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is adapted to saline and arid conditions, making it a resilient component of coastal vegetation."
