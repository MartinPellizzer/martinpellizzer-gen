    "intro": "Micropholis, commonly known as the dwarf apple or small-leaved apple, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Anacardiaceae. It consists of several species, predominantly found in tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plants are characterized by their small, leathery leaves and small, often edible fruits that resemble apples in appearance. Micropholis species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, often in dry, rocky soils. They play a role in local ecosystems and have been used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities."
