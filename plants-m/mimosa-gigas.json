    "intro": "Mimosa gigas, commonly known as the giant sensitive plant, is a species native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold together when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its sensitive nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
