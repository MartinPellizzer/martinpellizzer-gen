    "intro": "Medicago murex var. ovata, commonly known as the ovate goat's rue, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, and its erect, sparsely branched stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, which are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open woodlands. Its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen makes it an important plant in soil enrichment and ecological restoration efforts."
