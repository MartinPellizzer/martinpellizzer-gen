    "intro": "Macropanax cyrtostylus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sikaia, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is a member of the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, followed by dark blue berries that are an important food source for native wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, Macropanax cyrtostylus is highly vulnerable to extinction and is protected under Australian conservation laws."
