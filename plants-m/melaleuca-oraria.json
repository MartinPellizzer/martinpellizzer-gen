    "intro": "Melaleuca oraria, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia, where it typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels away in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers. Melaleuca oraria is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in harsh coastal environments."
