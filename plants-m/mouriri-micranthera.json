It belongs to the family Chrysobalanaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fruits that are typically round and covered in a thin, leathery skin.
