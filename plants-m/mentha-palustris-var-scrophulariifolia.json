    "intro": "Mentha palustris var. scrophulariifolia, commonly known as marsh mint, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, upright stems that often grow up to 3 feet tall, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a distinctive serrated margin. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its aromatic leaves contain menthol and other volatile oils, giving it a fresh, minty scent. This variety is often confused with other mint species but can be distinguished by its specific habitat and floral structure."
