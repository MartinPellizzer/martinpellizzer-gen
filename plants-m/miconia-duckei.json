    "intro": "Miconia duckei, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or Miconia tree, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage and floral display. However, it can be invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
