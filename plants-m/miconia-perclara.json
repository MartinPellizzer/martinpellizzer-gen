    "intro": "Miconia perclara, commonly known as the brightleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by distinctive, round, orange-red fruits. Miconia perclara is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, which can make it an invasive species in some regions. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests."
