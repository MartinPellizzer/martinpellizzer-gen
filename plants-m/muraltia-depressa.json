    "intro": "Muraltia depressa, commonly known as the dwarf muraltia, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features dense, dark green foliage with small, elliptical leaves that are often slightly pubescent. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pinkish flowers, which are followed by small, red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its compact growth habit. Muraltia depressa is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
