    "intro": "Microstylis nephroglossa, commonly known as the kidney-tongue fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori covered by a thin indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or in forest undergrowth. Due to its small size and unique morphology, it is a relatively uncommon and specialized species within its native habitat."
