    "intro": "Micropolypodium setulosum, commonly known as the hairy polypody, is a fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are usually short and creeping, allowing it to spread gradually across suitable substrates. Micropolypodium setulosum is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, low-light conditions."
