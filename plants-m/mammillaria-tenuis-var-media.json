    "intro": "Mammillaria tenuis var. media, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mammillaria, is a compact cactus native to Mexico. It features a cylindrical stem with a smooth, pale green surface and small, rounded tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well-suited for arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Due to its small size and ornamental appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
