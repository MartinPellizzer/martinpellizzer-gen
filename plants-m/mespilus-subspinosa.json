    "intro": "Mespilus subspinosa, commonly known as the rough medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves and fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, round fruits that mature to a purplish-black color, often with a distinctive cap or calyx remaining at the top. Its fruit is typically harvested in late autumn and is known for its aromatic, slightly tart flavor. Mespilus subspinosa is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and floral display."
