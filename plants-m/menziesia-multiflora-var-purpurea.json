    "intro": "Menziesia multiflora var. purpurea, commonly known as the purpleflower menziesia, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, blooming in early spring. These flowers are followed by small, red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands and streambanks."
