    "intro": "Magnolia foveolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved magnolia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The flowers are typically white or pale pink and are borne on short pedicels. The plant has a compact growth habit and produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
