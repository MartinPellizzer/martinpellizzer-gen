    "intro": "Maesobotrya pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered maesobotrya, is a rare and understudied plant species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small, shrub-like plant with simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, typically appearing in yellow or greenish hues. It produces small, oval fruits that contain a single seed, which is enclosed in a fleshy aril. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
