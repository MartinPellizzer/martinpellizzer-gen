    "intro": "Megalochlamys revoluta subsp. cognata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed megalochlamys, is a member of the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and conical, spiky capitula that bear yellow to orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in arid and semi-arid regions. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in full sun. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it prefers well-drained conditions to avoid root rot."
