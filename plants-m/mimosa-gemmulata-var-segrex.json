    "intro": "Mimosa gemmulata var. segrex, commonly known as the Segre xerothamnus, is a shrub native to the arid regions of South Africa. It features small, fern-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces delicate, yellow flower clusters that bloom in spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
