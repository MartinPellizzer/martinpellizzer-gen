    "intro": "Marcetia fastigiata var. imbricata, commonly known as the upright marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in Europe. It features tall, erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, adorned with lance-shaped, dark green leaves. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers in late summer, arranged in dense spikes along the stem. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to waterlogged soils, allowing it to thrive in moist environments. This variety is distinguished by its tightly overlapping leaves, giving it the common name \"imbricata,\" which refers to the overlapping arrangement."
