    "intro": "Magnolia bintuluensis, commonly known as the Bintulu magnolia, is a rare flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter, typically displaying white or pale pink hues. The plant belongs to the Magnoliaceae family and is known for its fragrant, cup-shaped blooms that appear before the leaves in early spring. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered critically endangered and requires protection to ensure its survival."
