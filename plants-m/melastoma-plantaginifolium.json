    "intro": "Melastoma plantaginifolium, commonly known as the small-leaved melastoma, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly pubescent surface. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
