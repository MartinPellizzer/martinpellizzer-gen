    "intro": "Macrozamia pectinata, commonly known as the broad-leafed cycad, is a slow-growing, evergreen plant native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces both male and female cones, with the female cones typically appearing at the base of the trunk. It is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is also considered a threatened species in some areas."
