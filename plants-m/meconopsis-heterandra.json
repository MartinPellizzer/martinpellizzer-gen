    "intro": "Meconopsis heterandra, commonly known as the Himalayan blue poppy, is a striking alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the Papaveraceae family and is characterized by its vibrant blue or purple petals that resemble those of the traditional poppy. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, thriving in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a splash of color to the rocky landscapes where it is found. Meconopsis heterandra is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
