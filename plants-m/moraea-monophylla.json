    "intro": "Moraea monophylla, commonly known as the single-leaf glory-of-the-snow, is a striking South African bulbous plant belonging to the Iridaceae family. It is characterized by its single, large, lance-shaped leaf and its showy, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces a tall flowering stem that can reach up to 1 meter in height, making it a notable ornamental species. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens."
