    "intro": "Moutabea gentryi, commonly known as the Gentry's moutabea, is a rare and critically endangered species native to the rainforests of western Africa. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it faces significant threats to its survival in the wild."
