    "intro": "Millettia japonica var. microphylla, commonly known as the Japanese millettia, is a small evergreen shrub native to East Asia. It features glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and have a smooth texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by elliptical, brownish pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its compact size and seasonal floral display."
