    "intro": "Monardella nana, commonly known as dwarf monardella, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry meadows and open woodlands. Its compact size and attractive flowers make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
