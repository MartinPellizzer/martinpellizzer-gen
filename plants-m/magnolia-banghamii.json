    "intro": "Magnolia banghamii, commonly known as the Bangham magnolia, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in early spring, often preceding the foliage. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
