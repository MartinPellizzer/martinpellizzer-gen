    "intro": "Myrcia leucantha, commonly known as the white myrtle, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like eucalyptus and clove. The plant is characterized by its small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are elliptical, glossy, and have a fragrant scent, while its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that split open to release seeds. Myrcia leucantha is often found in moist, shaded areas of tropical and subtropical forests."
