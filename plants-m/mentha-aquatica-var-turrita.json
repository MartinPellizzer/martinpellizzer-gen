    "intro": "Mentha aquatica var. turrita, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in wet or marshy environments, often found near streams, ponds, and damp woodlands. The plant has slender, aromatic leaves that are typically narrower than those of the standard Mentha aquatica. Its flowers are small, pinkish-white, and arranged in whorls along the stem. This variety is valued for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in herbal remedies."
