    "intro": "Mimosa multipinna var. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf sensitive plant, is a compact shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimuli. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its sensitivity and aesthetic appeal, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in warm climates."
