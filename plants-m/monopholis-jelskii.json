It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of delicate, white or pink flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. It is often found in alpine meadows and is known for its ability to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
