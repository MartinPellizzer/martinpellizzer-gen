It features a short, thick stem covered in white, woolly spines and small, rounded areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Mammillaria globosa is a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation due to its ornamental appearance and resilience."
