    "intro": "Mimulus longiflorus var. linearis, commonly known as the linear monkeyflower, is a striking annual herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that give it its varietal name, and its showy, orange-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as streambanks and meadows, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowers attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and butterflies, making it an important species in local ecosystems. The linear monkeyflower is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
