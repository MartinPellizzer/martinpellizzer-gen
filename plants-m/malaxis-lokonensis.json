    "intro": "Malaxis lokonensis, commonly known as the Lokon Orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Indonesia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, terrestrial growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the cooler months. It requires specific environmental conditions, including high humidity and indirect light, to thrive. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
