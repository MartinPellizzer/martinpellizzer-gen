    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 fallax, commonly known as the marsh mint, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Mentha aquatica and Mentha longifolia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shady environments such as wet meadows and stream banks. The plant features aromatic, serrated leaves and produces small, pale blue or purple flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, making it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed. Mentha \u00d7 fallax is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in herbal remedies."
