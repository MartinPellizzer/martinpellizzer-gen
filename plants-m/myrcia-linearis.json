It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for native wildlife. Myrcia linearis thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in rainforest or heathland environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses by Indigenous Australian communities."
