    "intro": "Micromyrtus fimbrisepala, commonly known as the serrated-leaf myrtle, is a small shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with serrated margins, which are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its aromatic leaves and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for coastal gardens. It is well adapted to saline and sandy soils, thriving in coastal environments with full sun exposure."
