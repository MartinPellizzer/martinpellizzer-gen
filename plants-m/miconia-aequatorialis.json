    "intro": "Miconia aequatorialis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the humid lowland forests of South America. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often accompanied by small, fleshy fruits. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in secondary forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in some tropical regions, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
