    "intro": "Mentzelia lutea, commonly known as the yellow mentzelia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its showy yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, are clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences. Mentzelia lutea is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
