    "intro": "Myrodia angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf myrtle, is a shrub native to Australia, particularly found in the arid and semi-arid regions of Western Australia. It has small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often appearing in spring. It is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. Myrodia angustifolia is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value in dry gardens."
