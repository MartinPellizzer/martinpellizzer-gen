    "intro": "Microlepia puberula var. pilosior, commonly known as the hairy sword fern, is a variant of the sword fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its long, slender fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce dense clusters of foliage. The fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
