    "intro": "Molinia caerulea var. flavescens, commonly known as yellow moorgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive yellowish-green foliage, which contrasts with the more typical bluish-green of the standard variety. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle ornamental value to its appearance. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wet meadows and bogs. Due to its hardy nature, it is a popular choice for ecological restoration projects and naturalized landscapes."
