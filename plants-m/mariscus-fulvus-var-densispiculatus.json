    "intro": "Mariscus fulvus var. densispiculatus, commonly known as the dense-spined mariscus, is a rare and specialized plant species characterized by its unique morphological features. It typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments, where it has adapted to harsh conditions. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with dense, spiny foliage that serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often clustered in inflorescences, and it produces distinctive, elongated fruits. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
