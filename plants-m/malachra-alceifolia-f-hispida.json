    "intro": "Malachra alceifolia f. hispida, commonly known as the hairy malachra, is a compact shrub native to South Africa. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are densely covered with fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
