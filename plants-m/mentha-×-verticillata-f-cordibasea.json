    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 verticillata f. cordibasea, commonly known as the broad-leaf water mint, is a hybrid plant in the mint family (Lamiaceae). It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating on the surface of water. This variety thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are typically arranged in whorls around the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer, contributing to its ornamental value in water gardens."
