    "intro": "Mimosa macedoana var. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous mimosa, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by the sensitivity of its stipules. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and resilience."
