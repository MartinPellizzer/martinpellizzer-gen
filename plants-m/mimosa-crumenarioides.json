    "intro": "Mimosa crumenarioides, commonly known as the yellow mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait known as thigmonastic movement. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in some regions."
