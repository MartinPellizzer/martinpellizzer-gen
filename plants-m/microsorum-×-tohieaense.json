    "intro": "Microsorum \u00d7 tohieaense, commonly known as the hybrid water fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Microsorum pteropus and Microsorum musifolium. It is characterized by its lush, dark green fronds that are typically broad and lance-shaped, with a distinctive waxy texture. The plant thrives in aquatic environments, often found in slow-moving streams and ponds with soft, acidic water. Its rhizomes form dense mats, helping to stabilize substrates and provide habitat for small aquatic organisms. Microsorum \u00d7 tohieaense is popular in aquascaping due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of maintenance."
