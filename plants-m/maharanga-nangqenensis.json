    "intro": "Maharanga nangqenensis, commonly known as the Nangqen maharanga, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, clustered inflorescences and small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
