It is characterized by its unique, pouch-like flower that resembles a slipper, typically ranging in color from white to pink. The plant produces a single, erect stem with a few leaves and a single, showy flower. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forested areas. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable species in botanical studies."
