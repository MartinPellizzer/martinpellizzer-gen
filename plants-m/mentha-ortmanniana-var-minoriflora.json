    "intro": "Mentha ortmanniana var. minoriflora, commonly known as the lesser-flowered field mint, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features slender, upright stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a strong minty aroma. Small, pale blue or purple flowers appear in whorls along the stems, blooming from late spring to early summer. This variety is closely related to other mint species and is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its aromatic and medicinal properties."
