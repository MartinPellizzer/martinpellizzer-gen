    "intro": "Macrothyrsus odorata, commonly known as the fragrant thornapple, is a tropical shrub native to regions of Africa and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its branched, spiny stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Its aromatic leaves and flowers make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening, though it can be invasive in certain environments. The species is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal practices."
