    "intro": "Merrilliopanax tibetanus, commonly known as the Tibetan ginseng, is a rare and unique plant native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive compound leaves and milky sap. The plant is known for its slow growth and is often found in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its botanical features make it an important subject for botanical research, particularly in the study of alpine flora. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
