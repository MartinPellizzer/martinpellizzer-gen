    "intro": "Masema carinatum, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a shrub native to the high elevations of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, glossy leaves that are often arranged in a compact, rounded shape. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
