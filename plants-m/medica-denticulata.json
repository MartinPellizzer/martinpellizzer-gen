    "intro": "Medica denticulata, commonly known as the toothed medica, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which are followed by three-lobed, bladder-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Medica denticulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some cultures."
