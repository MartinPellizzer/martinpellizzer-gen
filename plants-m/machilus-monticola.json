It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by elliptical berries that turn dark purple when mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Machilus monticola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
