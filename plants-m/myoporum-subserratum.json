    "intro": "Myoporum subserratum, commonly known as the silverleaf myoporum, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that provides a striking visual contrast against its dark green stems. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Myoporum subserratum is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
