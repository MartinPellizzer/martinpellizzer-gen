    "intro": "Melicope belahe, commonly known as the Hawaiian melicope, is a small evergreen tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by oval, woody fruits. Melicope belahe is often found in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests, where it thrives in humid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
