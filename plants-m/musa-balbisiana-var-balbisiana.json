    "intro": "Musa balbisiana var. balbisiana, commonly known as the wild banana, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is a herbaceous plant with large, broad leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces clusters of yellow, fleshy berries that are typically inedible due to their high acidity. It is often used as a rootstock for cultivated bananas due to its hardiness and disease resistance. The plant plays an important role in the ecological and agricultural systems of its native habitat."
