    "intro": "Maharanga bracteata, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a distinctive plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Cyatheaceae family and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a mass of overlapping, leathery fronds. The plant features a central stem that grows upward, with fronds emerging from the base and spiraling around the trunk. Its unique appearance makes it a popular ornamental plant, though it is also valued for its ecological role in native forests. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the cool, temperate climate of its native habitat."
