    "intro": "Miconia gonoptera, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a large shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are typically white or pink, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, round fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
