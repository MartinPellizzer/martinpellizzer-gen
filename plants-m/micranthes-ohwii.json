    "intro": "Micranthes ohwii, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada and other mountainous regions of California. It is a perennial herb with small, delicate leaves and clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its compact growth habit and alpine distribution make it a characteristic species of montane ecosystems. Micranthes ohwii is often found in open meadows and along stream banks at elevations above 7,000 feet."
