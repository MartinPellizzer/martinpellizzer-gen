    "intro": "Molinia caerulea var. mollis, commonly known as soft purple moor grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, dark green leaves that are soft to the touch, distinguishing it from other varieties of Molinia. The plant produces dense clusters of purple to pinkish flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and other moist habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
