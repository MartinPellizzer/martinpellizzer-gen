    "intro": "Mimosa bifurca var. hassleriana, commonly known as the Hassler's sensitive plant, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaflets. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in racemes, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in warm climates for its unique leaf movement."
