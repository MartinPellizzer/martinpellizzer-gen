    "intro": "Maianthemum fusciduliflorum, commonly known as the yellow false shamrock, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically green with a slight bluish tinge. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences of white to pale yellow flowers in late spring. Its flowers have six tepals that are often reflexed, and it is pollinated primarily by flies and beetles. The plant thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in association with other understory species."
