    "intro": "Mullerochloa, commonly known as the silver hair grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to southern Africa. It features slender, silver-tomentose blades that give it a distinctive, silvery appearance. The plant typically forms dense mats and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value. Mullerochloa is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid environments."
