    "intro": "Mirabilis laevis var. cedrosensis, commonly known as the Cedros Island four o'clock, is a flowering plant native to the island of Cedros in the Gulf of California. It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers that open in the late afternoon and close at dawn. The plant has slender, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves with a smooth texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in coastal scrub habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
