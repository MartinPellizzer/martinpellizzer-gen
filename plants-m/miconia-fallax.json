    "intro": "Miconia fallax, commonly known as the false miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in dense, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
