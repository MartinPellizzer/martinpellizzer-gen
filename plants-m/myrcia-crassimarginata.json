It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often aromatic and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. Myrcia crassimarginata is also valued for its essential oils, which are used in perfumes and traditional medicine."
