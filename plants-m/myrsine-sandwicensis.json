It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that are often visited by native bees and other pollinators. It is typically found growing in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Myrsine sandwicensis is an important component of Hawaii's native flora and is considered a species of conservation concern due to habitat loss and invasive species."
