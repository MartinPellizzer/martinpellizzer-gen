    "intro": "Maxillaria uncata, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking pink and white flowers that resemble a slipper, with a distinctive pouch-like structure at the base. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in seasonal environments. Its leaves are typically dark green and strap-shaped, arranged along the stem. Maxillaria uncata thrives in humid, shaded conditions and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
