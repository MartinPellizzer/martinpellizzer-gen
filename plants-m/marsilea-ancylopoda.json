    "intro": "Marsilea ancylopoda, commonly known as water clover, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Marsileaceae and is characterized by its small, four-leaf clover-like fronds. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and wetlands. Its reproductive structures include floating, spore-bearing fruits that contribute to its propagation. Marsilea ancylopoda plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and aiding in water filtration."
