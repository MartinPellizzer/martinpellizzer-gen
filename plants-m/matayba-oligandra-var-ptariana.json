    "intro": "Matayba oligandra var. ptariana, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a shrub or small tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are usually opposite or alternate in arrangement. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by orange-red berries that contain several seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in non-native habitats."
