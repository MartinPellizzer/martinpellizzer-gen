    "intro": "Mimosa longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed sensitive plant, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in the spring. Mimosa longipes is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial shade. Its unique sensitivity to touch and rapid leaf movement make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
