    "intro": "Mimosa pinnata, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Americas. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and summer. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Mimosa pinnata is also known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes."
