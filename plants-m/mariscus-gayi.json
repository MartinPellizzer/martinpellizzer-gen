    "intro": "Mariscus gayi, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous species that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils along the shoreline. The plant is characterized by its delicate, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom during the winter months. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Mariscus gayi is considered a vulnerable species."
