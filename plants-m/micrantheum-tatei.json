    "intro": "Micrantheum tatei, commonly known as the Japanese mountain orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of tiny, white or pale pink flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Micrantheum tatei is considered a vulnerable species."
