It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Maerua ternata is often used in traditional medicine and for its hardy, resilient nature."
