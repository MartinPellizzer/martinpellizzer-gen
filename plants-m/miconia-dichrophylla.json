    "intro": "Miconia dichrophylla, commonly known as the two-colored miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter green on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its fruit is a bright red, fleshy berry that contains numerous tiny seeds. Miconia dichrophylla is often found in moist, shaded forest understories and is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets."
