    "intro": "Malva lignescens, commonly known as the tree mallow, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems that become fibrous and hard with age, giving it a tree-like appearance. The plant features large, palmately lobed leaves with a velvety underside, and it produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. Its fibrous stems are valued for their strength and have been used in traditional crafts and as a source of fiber. Malva lignescens thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas."
