It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops.

Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially vulnerable species."
