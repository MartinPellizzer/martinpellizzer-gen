    "intro": "Meum tenuifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved meum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and typically herbaceous structure. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Meum tenuifolium is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in sunny, well-drained environments. It is not commonly cultivated but is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its ecological role in its native habitats."
