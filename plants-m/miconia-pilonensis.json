    "intro": "Miconia pilonensis, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or pata de vaca, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pink flowers that are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous small, winged seeds. Miconia pilonensis is also noted for its ability to thrive in shaded understory conditions in humid tropical forests."
