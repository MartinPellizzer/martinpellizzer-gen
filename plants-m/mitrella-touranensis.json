    "intro": "Mitrella touranensis, commonly known as the Touran's mitrella, is a small, flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-shaped inflorescences. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
