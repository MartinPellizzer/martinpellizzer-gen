    "intro": "Mostuea muricata, commonly known as the spiny papyrus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems and clusters of small, spadix-like flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Mostuea muricata is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
