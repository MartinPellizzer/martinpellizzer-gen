    "intro": "Malaxis thlaspiformis, commonly known as the thlaspoid orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in a raceme, and its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity, often growing in rocky or alpine habitats. It is a terrestrial orchid that relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common feature among orchid species. Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
