    "intro": "Microchilus maasii, commonly known as the Maasai orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to eastern Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, organic soil of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Microchilus maasii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
