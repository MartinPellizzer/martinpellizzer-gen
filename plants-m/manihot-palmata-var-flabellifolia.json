    "intro": "Manihot palmata var. flabellifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf manioc, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and potential for use in traditional medicine, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
