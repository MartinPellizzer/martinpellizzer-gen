    "intro": "Morelosia domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican morelosia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Dominican Republic. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in cloud forests, where it relies on specific microclimates for survival. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers range in color from white to pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Morelosia domingensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
