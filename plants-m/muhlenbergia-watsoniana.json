    "intro": "Muhlenbergia watsoniana, commonly known as Watson's muhlenbergia, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silver-green foliage that turns bronze in the winter. The plant produces delicate, feathery panicles of small, pale blue to purple flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sun, making it a drought-tolerant choice for xeriscaping. Muhlenbergia watsoniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and nectar for local wildlife."
