    "intro": "Mansonia, commonly known as the mangrove or swamp mahogany, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Meliaceae. These plants are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in wetland or mangrove environments. They are characterized by their rough, often fissured bark and opposite, simple leaves. The flowers are small and usually clustered, with white or yellow petals, and the fruit is a capsule containing several seeds. Mansonia species play an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal and freshwater ecosystems."
