    "intro": "Melaleuca microcarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bottlebrush, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and striking clusters of bright red or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, woody fruits called follicles, which contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland heathlands. Melaleuca microcarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract native pollinators."
