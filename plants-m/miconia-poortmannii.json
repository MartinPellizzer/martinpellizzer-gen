    "intro": "Miconia poortmannii, commonly known as the Caribbean miconia, is a member of the Melastomataceae family. It is a shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean islands, including Cuba, Hispaniola, and Jamaica. The plant is characterized by its large, glossy leaves and showy, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other tropical regions, though it can become invasive in some areas."
