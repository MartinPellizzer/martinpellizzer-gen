    "intro": "Masdevallia ignea var. hobartii, commonly known as the Hobart's fiery masdevallia, is a striking orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, flame-like red and orange floral display, which is particularly showy during the cooler months. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial orchid with a pseudobulb and produces a single, intricate flower per stem. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to the high-altitude, humid environments where it thrives. This variety is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique coloration and relatively compact size."
