    "intro": "Mimosa craspedisetosa, commonly known as the hairy mimosa, is a deciduous shrub native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellow flowers. The plant is known for its sensitive leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait called thigmonastic response. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and open woodlands. The hairy mimosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
