    "intro": "Microstylis mixta, commonly known as the hybrid microstylis, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, forming dense clumps with narrow, cylindrical leaves. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its adaptability, it is often found in disturbed wetland habitats and is of interest to botanists studying wetland ecosystems."
