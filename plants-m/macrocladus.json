    "intro": "Macrocladus, commonly known as the rockrose, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Ericaceae. These plants are typically shrubs characterized by their evergreen foliage and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. They are native to regions with Mediterranean climates, including parts of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. Macrocladus species are adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or coastal areas. Their ability to thrive in harsh environments makes them popular in xeriscaping and garden design."
