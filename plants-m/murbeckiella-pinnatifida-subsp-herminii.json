    "intro": "Murbeckiella pinnatifida subsp. herminii, commonly known as the Herminii fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to specific regions of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely pinnatifid (bifurcated) fronds that exhibit a distinct, lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous or forested areas with high humidity. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
