    "intro": "Milium punctatum, commonly known as the dotted millet, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a small annual herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikelets, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Milium punctatum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and low maintenance requirements."
