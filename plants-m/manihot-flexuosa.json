    "intro": "Manihot flexuosa, commonly known as the creeping arrowroot, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features a fibrous root system that is often used for its starchy tubers, which are a source of carbohydrates. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or wetlands, and has heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface. Its flowering stems produce small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. The plant is valued both for its edible roots and its role in traditional medicine."
