    "intro": "Malaxis foliosa, commonly known as the leafy malaxis, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a raceme, which are typically pollinated by specific insect species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
