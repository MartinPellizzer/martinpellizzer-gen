    "intro": "Madronella ingrata, commonly known as the Florida madrone, is a small evergreen tree native to the southeastern United States. It has smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that persist into the winter. Its leaves are elliptical, leathery, and remain green throughout the year. Madronella ingrata is adapted to acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and coastal areas."
