    "intro": "Micromeria thymoides var. rupestris, commonly known as desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, herbaceous annual with small, fragrant, pink to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is well-suited to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
