    "intro": "Mimusops, commonly known as the satinwood or tropical ash, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Sapotaceae. It includes several species, many of which are native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plants are typically small to medium-sized trees or shrubs, characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. Mimusops species often produce small, round fruits that are either fleshy or dry, depending on the species. These botanical features make them valuable in both ornamental horticulture and ecological contexts."
