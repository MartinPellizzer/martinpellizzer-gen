    "intro": "Microchloa kandalaensis, commonly known as the Kandala grass, is a small, perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which are typical of the grass family Poaceae. Microchloa kandalaensis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and potential horticultural use."
