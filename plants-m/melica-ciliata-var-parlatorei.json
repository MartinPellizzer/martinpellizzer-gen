    "intro": "Melica ciliata var. parlatorei, commonly known as the silky meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, grassy habitats such as meadows and wetlands. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that have a distinctive silvery sheen along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches. This variant is distinguished by its finely ciliate (fringed) leaf margins, which contribute to its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wet environments."
