It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features woody stems and rough, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, and they bloom in late summer to early autumn. Microcos coriacea is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions."
