    "intro": "Malaxis palustris, commonly known as the marsh helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and produces clusters of pale green to yellowish flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in peat bogs and marshes. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly bees, and it has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. Malaxis palustris is a relatively small orchid, typically growing to a height of around 20-30 centimeters."
