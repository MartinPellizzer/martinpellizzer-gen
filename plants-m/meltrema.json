    "intro": "Meltrema, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The plants are characterized by their large, showy leaves and distinctive inflorescences that resemble umbels. They typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Meltrema species are often cultivated for their ornamental value, though some species contain toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
