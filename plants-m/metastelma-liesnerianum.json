    "intro": "Metastelma liesnerianum, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
