    "intro": "Maresia doumetiana var. trichocarpa, commonly known as the hairy maresia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique foliage, featuring dense, hairy leaves that provide a distinctive texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in montane forests. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
