    "intro": "Mitrasacme cunninghamii, commonly known as the Cunningham's mitrasacme, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is a small shrub characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes."
