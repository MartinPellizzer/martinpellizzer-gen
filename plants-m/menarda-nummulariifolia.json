    "intro": "Menarda nummulariifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf sunflower, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers with a prominent central disk, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a valuable ornamental plant in dryland gardens."
