It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue and violet, which bloom in late summer. Its flowering stems are usually unbranched and bear several flowers arranged in a terminal cluster. Monachochlamys floribunda is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in alpine gardens."
