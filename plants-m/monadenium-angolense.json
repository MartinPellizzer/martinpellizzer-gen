    "intro": "Monadenium angolense, commonly known as the Angola candelabra, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, commonly known as the ice plant family. The plant is characterized by its branched, succulent stems that resemble a candelabra, and its small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and white. It is typically found in rocky, arid environments and is well adapted to drought conditions. Monadenium angolense is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appearance."
