    "intro": "Mucuna macropoda, commonly known as the large cowpea or velvet bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces elongated pods containing large, flat, edible seeds that are rich in protein and used in various culinary applications. Mucuna macropoda is also notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil fertility. Additionally, it contains compounds with potential medicinal properties, though it can be toxic in high doses."
