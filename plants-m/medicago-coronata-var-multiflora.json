    "intro": "Medicago coronata var. multiflora, commonly known as the crown vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a deep root system, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for erosion control. It is often used in landscaping and reclamation projects due to its hardiness and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
