It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
