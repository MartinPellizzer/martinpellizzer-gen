The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with four petals, and its leaves are usually scale-like or linear. It is adapted to harsh environments, exhibiting a low growth habit to minimize exposure to wind and cold. Minuartia idaea is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
