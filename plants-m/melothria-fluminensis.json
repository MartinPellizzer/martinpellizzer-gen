    "intro": "Melothria fluminensis, commonly known as the Brazilian sour gooseberry, is a small, trailing vine native to South America. It produces small, yellow-orange fruits that are typically less than 1 centimeter in diameter. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and hairy stems, which help it cling to supports as it climbs. The fruits are edible but have a tart, acidic flavor, often used in local cuisines. Botanically, it belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes other cucurbits like cucumbers and squash."
