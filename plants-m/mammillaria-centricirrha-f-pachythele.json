    "intro": "Mammillaria centricirrha f. pachythele, commonly known as the woolly mammillaria, is a compact cactus native to Mexico. It features a rounded stem covered in dense, white to grayish woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring or early summer. Its growth is slow, and it typically reaches a height of around 10 to 15 centimeters. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and is often cultivated as a decorative succulent."
