    "intro": "Mallotus maclurei, commonly known as the Maclure's holly, is a small evergreen shrub native to the eastern coast of Australia. It typically grows to a height of about 2 to 3 meters, featuring dense, glossy dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are an important food source for birds. Its adaptability to coastal conditions makes it a popular choice for landscaping in sandy soils."
