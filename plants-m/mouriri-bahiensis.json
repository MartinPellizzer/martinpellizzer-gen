    "intro": "Mouriri bahiensis, commonly known as the Brazilian bitter apple, is a small evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical, glossy dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by round, orange-red fruits that contain a single seed. The fruit is typically edible when ripe but has a bitter taste due to the presence of saponins. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of natural products."
