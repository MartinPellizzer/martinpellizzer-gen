    "intro": "Micropolypodium sherringii, commonly known as the Sherring's polypody, is a small epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit with closely spaced, linear leaves. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. The sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family."
