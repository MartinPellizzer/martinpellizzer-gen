    "intro": "Milium pungens, commonly known as the spiny millet, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family, Poaceae. It is native to regions of Asia and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-like flowers. Milium pungens is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in arid environments. Its name derives from the sharp, bristly structures that cover its seed heads, giving it a distinctive appearance."
