    "intro": "Micromeria zarkosii, commonly known as the Zarkos mountain sandthrift, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Mediterranean. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Micromeria zarkosii is often found in open habitats such as slopes and cliffs, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
