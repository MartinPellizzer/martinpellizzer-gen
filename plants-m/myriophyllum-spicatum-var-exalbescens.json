    "intro": "Myriophyllum spicatum var. exalbescens, commonly known as the white watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to North America. It has slender, branching stems that are often covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces tiny white flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in clusters at the water's surface. It is often found in slow-moving freshwater lakes and ponds. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain aquatic environments."
