    "intro": "Mimulus unimaculatus, commonly known as the one-spotted monkeyflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its striking orange-red flowers with a single dark spot on each petal. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in open woodlands. It has heart-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Mimulus unimaculatus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also important in ecological studies due to its role in supporting pollinators."
