It is characterized by its greenish-gray thallus with a distinct upper and lower cortex. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide photosynthetic capabilities. It typically grows on tree trunks and rocks in humid tropical and subtropical regions. Miconia lundelliana is often used in ecological studies due to its role in soil stabilization and as an indicator of air quality."
