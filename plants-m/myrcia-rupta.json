    "intro": "Myrcia rupta, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a member of the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are edible but have a strong, spicy flavor. Myrcia rupta is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming invasive. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
