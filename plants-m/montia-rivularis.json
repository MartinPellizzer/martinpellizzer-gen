    "intro": "Montia rivularis, commonly known as the stream montia, is a small flowering plant native to moist, rocky stream banks in North America. It is an annual herb that typically grows to a height of 5\u201320 cm, with slender, branching stems and small, alternate leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale blue flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. Its flowers are often pollinated by insects, and the plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils near water sources. Montia rivularis is often found in riparian zones and is an indicator species for healthy, undisturbed stream habitats."
