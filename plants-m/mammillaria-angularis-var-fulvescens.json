    "intro": "Mammillaria angularis var. fulvescens, commonly known as the orange-tipped hedgehog cactus, is a compact, spiny cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular stem covered in small, rounded tubercles that bear white or pale yellow flowers. The plant has a slow growth rate and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its distinctive orange to reddish coloration on the stems and flowers makes it a striking addition to succulent collections. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its compact size and low maintenance requirements."
