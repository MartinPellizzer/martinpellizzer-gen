    "intro": "Medicago sativa var. integrifoliola, commonly known as the broadleaf alfalfa, is a variant of the common alfalfa plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its large, entire leaves that are typically trifoliate, with each leaflet having a smooth, rounded edge. This plant is a legume, belonging to the Fabaceae family, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. It produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by cylindrical seed pods containing small, rounded seeds. Due to its robust growth and nutritional value, it is often cultivated as forage for livestock and has historical uses in traditional medicine."
