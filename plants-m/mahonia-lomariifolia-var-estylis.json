    "intro": "Mahonia lomariifolia var. estylis, commonly known as the coastal mahonia, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its holly-like leaves, which are glossy and deeply lobed, providing ornamental value throughout the growing season. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are followed by blue-black berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes and ecological restoration projects."
