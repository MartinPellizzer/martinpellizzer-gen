    "intro": "Mariscus conicus, commonly known as the coneflower or conical mariscus, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive conical inflorescence, which consists of tightly packed, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun conditions. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and birds due to their nectar-rich structure. Mariscus conicus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought-resistant properties."
