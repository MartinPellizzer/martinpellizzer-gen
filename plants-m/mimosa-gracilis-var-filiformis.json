It features delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a characteristic known as thigmonasty. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or container planting. Its unique appearance and responsive foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
