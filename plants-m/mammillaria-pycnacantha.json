    "intro": "Mammillaria pycnacantha, commonly known as the dense-spined mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in dense, white radial spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It prefers well-draining soil and full sun exposure. Due to its compact size and ornamental appearance, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in rock gardens."
