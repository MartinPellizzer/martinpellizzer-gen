    "intro": "Miconia cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia cubensis is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive spreading habit."
