    "intro": "Myrsine capitellata var. sessiliflora, commonly known as the broad-leaved myrsine, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are usually elliptical or ovate in shape and have a smooth or slightly waxy surface. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences bearing white or pale yellow flowers, which are typically followed by small, spherical berries. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests. This variant is distinguished by its sessile (stemless) flowers, which are a key identifying feature."
