    "intro": "Melilotus dentatus, commonly known as the toothed melilot, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges that give it its common name. Melilotus dentatus is often found in meadows and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils."
