    "intro": "Muellerina eucalyptifolia, commonly known as the lemon scented gum, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often aromatic and emit a lemon-like scent when crushed. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in spring. Its bark is smooth and peels in thin layers, revealing a pale, mottled underbark. Muellerina eucalyptifolia is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in heathlands and open forests."
