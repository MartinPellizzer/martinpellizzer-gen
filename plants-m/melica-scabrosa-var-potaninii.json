    "intro": "Melica scabrosa var. potaninii, commonly known as the rough false brome, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its ecological importance, it is sometimes used in restoration projects to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
