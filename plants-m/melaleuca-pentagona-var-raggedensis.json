It is characterized by its rough, flaky bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, bottle-shaped flower spikes that are typically pink to red in color, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often found in dune environments. This species is known for its hardy nature and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
