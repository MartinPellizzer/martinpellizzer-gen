    "intro": "Melanthera carpenteri, commonly known as Carpenter's melanthera, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, which help it retain moisture in its often dry habitat. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands or disturbed areas. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
