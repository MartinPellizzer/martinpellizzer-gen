    "intro": "Mespilus ferruginea, commonly known as the red-armed whitebeam, is a deciduous tree native to western Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, rust-colored stipules that persist on the branches throughout the year. The tree produces small, white flowers in late spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart drupes in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a rough texture with prominent veins. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often found in woodlands and hedgerows."
