    "intro": "Maharanga limitanea var. major, commonly known as the greater maharanga, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its flowering stems produce small, clustered inflorescences, and it plays a vital role in its native ecosystem. Due to habitat loss, it is considered critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
