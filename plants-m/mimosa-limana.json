    "intro": "Mimosa limana, commonly known as the desert mimosa, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, characterized by its slender, branching structure. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in response to rainfall. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into multiple pairs of tiny leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. Mimosa limana is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and a waxy coating on its leaves to reduce water loss."
