    "intro": "Mentha arvensis var. latifolia, commonly known as broad-leaf mint, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are often hairy and have a strong, aromatic scent. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Its essential oils, rich in menthol and other compounds, make it valuable in both culinary and medicinal applications."
