    "intro": "Microtis media subsp. eremicola, commonly known as the desert microtis, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Australia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale blue flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations. It is often found in coastal dunes and inland deserts, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and land degradation."
