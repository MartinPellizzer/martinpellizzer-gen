    "intro": "Manihot reflexa, commonly known as the arrowleaf manioc, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its palmate leaves with three to five lobes. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by yellowish-orange fruits that contain toxic seeds. Its roots, like those of other manioc species, contain high levels of cyanogenic glycosides, which require careful processing before consumption. Despite its toxicity, it is cultivated for its starchy rootstock in some regions."
