    "intro": "Machaerina huttonii, commonly known as the Hutton's machaerina, is a species of flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, often spiky, leaf morphology. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Machaerina huttonii is considered a rare and endangered species."
