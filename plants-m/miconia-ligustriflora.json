    "intro": "Miconia ligustriflora, commonly known as the tropical miconia, is a species native to the humid lowland forests of Central and South America. It is a large, fast-growing shrub or small tree that can reach heights of up to 10 meters. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often glossy and dark green. It produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers, which are followed by distinctive, bright red, fleshy berries. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a potential weed in some regions."
