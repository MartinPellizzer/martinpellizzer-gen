    "intro": "Monvillea jaenensis var. paucispina, commonly known as the spiny monvillea, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family, characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to violet. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, showcasing its adaptability to arid environments. Its unique feature is the presence of spiny structures on its stems and leaves, which provide a protective mechanism against herbivores. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
