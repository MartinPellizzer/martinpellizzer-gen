It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, oily seeds that are used in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant produces large, leathery leaves and fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit, which is covered in a fleshy, red aril, contains the valuable seed kernels.
