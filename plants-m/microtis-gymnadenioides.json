    "intro": "Microtis gymnadenioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf microtis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Australia. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, commonly known as the orchid family, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale green, arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
