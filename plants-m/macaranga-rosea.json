    "intro": "Macaranga rosea, commonly known as the roseleaf macaranga, is a species of flowering plant in the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive rose-pink coloration on the underside. The plant is often found in moist, lowland forests and thrives in humid, tropical climates. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Macaranga rosea is also known for its rapid growth rate and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil."
