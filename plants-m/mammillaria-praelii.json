    "intro": "Mammillaria praelii, commonly known as the Praelii Hedgehog Cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular stem covered in white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
