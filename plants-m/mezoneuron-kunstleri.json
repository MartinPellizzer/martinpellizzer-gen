    "intro": "Mezoneuron kunstleri, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to harsh, dry environments. Mezoneuron kunstleri is often found in rocky habitats and is drought-tolerant, requiring minimal water once established. Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptation to survive in extreme desert conditions."
