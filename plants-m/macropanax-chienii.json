    "intro": "Macropanax chienii, commonly known as the Chien's giant aralia, is a rare and endangered plant native to the mountainous regions of central China. It is a large herbaceous plant with a distinctive, branched stem that can grow up to several meters in height. Its leaves are compound, consisting of multiple leaflets arranged in a feather-like pattern, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters. The plant is characterized by its thick, fleshy roots, which are adapted to store water in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, Macropanax chienii is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
