    "intro": "Marcetia andicola, commonly known as the Andean rock orchid, is a rare orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cold, dry conditions of its habitat. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pale purple, often blooming in late summer. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and specialized roots that help it anchor in steep, rocky terrain. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Marcetia andicola is considered a vulnerable species."
