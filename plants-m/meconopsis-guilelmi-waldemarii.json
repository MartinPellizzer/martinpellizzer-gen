    "intro": "Meconopsis guilelmi-waldemarii, commonly known as the Welsh poppy, is a rare and striking alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Wales. It belongs to the Papaveraceae family and is characterized by its bright blue or purple flowers with a distinctive yellow center. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in areas with limited vegetation. It has lance-shaped leaves that are hairy and grayish in appearance, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
