    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 bracteosa, commonly known as the hybrid mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Lamiaceae family. It is a cross between Mentha \u00d7 piperita (peppermint) and Mentha spicata (spearmint), resulting in a plant with a strong, aromatic scent. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly serrated edge and a glossy green color. It produces small, pale purple flowers that bloom in whorls along the stem, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This plant is often used in herbal remedies and as a flavoring agent due to its high menthol content."
