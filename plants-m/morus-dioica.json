    "intro": "Morus dioica, commonly known as the white mulberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Asia, Europe, and North Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive pink or white flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, fuzzy fruits called berries, which are edible for humans and animals. Morus dioica is often cultivated for its leaves, which are used in silkworm farming, and its roots, which have medicinal properties. It thrives in temperate climates and is adaptable to various soil types."
