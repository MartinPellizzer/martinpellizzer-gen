    "intro": "Melinis hirsuta, commonly known as hairy wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy, rhizomatous stems that help it survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers. Its leaves are narrow, rough, and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Melinis hirsuta is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
