It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its dense, spiky appearance with small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late winter or early spring. It is highly drought-tolerant and adapted to survive in harsh, sandy environments. Maihuenia poeppigii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
