    "intro": "Mimosa atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic mimosa, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by the plant's sensitivity to touch. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate floral display to its habitat. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or coastal scrub environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate regions."
