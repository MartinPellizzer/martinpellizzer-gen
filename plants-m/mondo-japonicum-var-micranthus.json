    "intro": "Mondo japonicum var. micranthus, commonly known as Japanese forest grass, is a low-growing, clump-forming perennial that thrives in shaded environments. It features narrow, dark green leaves that form a dense mat, making it an excellent ground cover. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or light green flowers in early spring, followed by bright red berries that attract birds. It is native to East Asia and is well adapted to moist, acidic soils. Due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal, it is widely used in landscaping and restoration projects."
