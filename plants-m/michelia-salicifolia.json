    "intro": "Michelia salicifolia, commonly known as the willowleaf Michelia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It belongs to the family Magnoliaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped, willow-like leaves. The plant produces fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in terminal panicles. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often exuding a milky sap when damaged. Michelia salicifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional Chinese medicine."
