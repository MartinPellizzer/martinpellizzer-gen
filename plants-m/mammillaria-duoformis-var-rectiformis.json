    "intro": "Mammillaria duoformis var. rectiformis, commonly known as the straight-form mammillaria, is a compact cactus native to Mexico. It features a cylindrical stem with prominent, straight spines that distinguish it from its varietal counterpart. The plant produces white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique morphology and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
