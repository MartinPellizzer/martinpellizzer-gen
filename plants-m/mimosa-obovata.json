    "intro": "Mimosa obovata, commonly known as the woolly mimosa, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its soft, silvery-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow, fern-like leaves and is known for its sensitive response to touch, causing the leaves to fold when disturbed. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The flowers are typically pale yellow and appear in clusters, adding to its visual appeal."
