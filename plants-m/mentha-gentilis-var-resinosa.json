    "intro": "Mentha gentilis var. resinosa, commonly known as wild mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, opposite leaves and square stems, typical of the mint family. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and meadows. Its essential oils, rich in menthol and other compounds, make it valuable for both culinary and medicinal uses."
