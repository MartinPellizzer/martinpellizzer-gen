    "intro": "Myrstiphyllum brachiatum, commonly known as the silky oak, is a tropical tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and large, palmately lobed leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silky down. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody pods containing flattened, winged seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rainforest or coastal habitats. Myrstiphyllum brachiatum is valued for its ornamental qualities and has some traditional uses by Indigenous Australian communities."
