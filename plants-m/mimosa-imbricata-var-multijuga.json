    "intro": "Mimosa imbricata var. multijuga, commonly known as the velvet mimosa, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its finely hairy, velvety foliage and small, yellow, pea-like flowers. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. The leaves are sensitive to touch, curling when disturbed, a trait shared with other mimosa species."
