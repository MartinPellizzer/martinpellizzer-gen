    "intro": "Mammillaria acanthophlegma var. leucocephala, commonly known as the white-headed hedgehog cactus, is a compact, spiny cactus native to Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem with white, woolly spines and a dense covering of pale blue to white glochids. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
