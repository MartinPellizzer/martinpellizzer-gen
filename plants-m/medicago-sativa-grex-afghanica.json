    "intro": "Medicago sativa grex afghanica, commonly known as Afghan clover, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Afghanistan. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. This plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a valuable forage species in dry climates. It has deep roots that help prevent soil erosion and improve soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. The plant is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
