    "intro": "Malus domestica subsp. rossica, commonly known as the Russian apple, is a subspecies of the domestic apple that is native to Central Asia and the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its small to medium-sized fruits, which typically have a tart flavor and are often used in jams and preserves. The plant is a deciduous tree with simple, alternate leaves and produces white flowers in the spring. It thrives in temperate climates and is relatively cold-hardy, making it suitable for cultivation in regions with harsh winters. The fruit's genetic diversity contributes to the broader apple species, offering valuable traits for breeding programs."
