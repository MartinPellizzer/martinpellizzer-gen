    "intro": "Medicago rotata subsp. eliezeri, commonly known as the Eliezer's blueburr, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, trifoliate leaves and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas and along roadsides. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it beneficial for soil enrichment in arid environments."
