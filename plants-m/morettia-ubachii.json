It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires specific conditions to flourish, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
