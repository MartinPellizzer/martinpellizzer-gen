    "intro": "Microsorum cromwellii, commonly known as the Cromwell's sword fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to the wetlands and streams of Southeast Asia, including regions such as Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. Its rhizomes are typically rooted in the substrate, allowing it to thrive in slow-moving or still freshwater environments. Microsorum cromwellii is valued in aquascaping for its aesthetic appeal and ability to enhance the natural look of planted tanks."
