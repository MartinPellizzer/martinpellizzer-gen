    "intro": "Mahonia flavida f. integrifolia, commonly known as the golden Mahonia, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features dense, leathery foliage with dark green, oval-shaped leaves that have a smooth, uninterrupted margin. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green, spiny flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal floral display."
