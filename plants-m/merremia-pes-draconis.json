It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are woody and can grow long, allowing it to climb and spread across supports. The fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals."
