    "intro": "Mimosa prolifica, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within its cells. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardens and indoor cultivation. Its unique sensitivity to touch and light makes it an intriguing subject for both botanical study and horticultural interest."
