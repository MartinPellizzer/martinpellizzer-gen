    "intro": "Marcanodendron, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its deciduous or evergreen shrubs and trees. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round fruits containing seeds. Marcanodendron species are valued for their hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, many species are now threatened with extinction."
