    "intro": "Melilotus messanensis f. caespitosus, commonly known as the tufted sweet clover, is a botanical variant of the sweet clover species. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit, which distinguishes it from other forms of Melilotus. This plant typically features small, yellow pea-like flowers and trifoliate leaves, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Its botanical significance lies in its morphological variation and ecological adaptability."
