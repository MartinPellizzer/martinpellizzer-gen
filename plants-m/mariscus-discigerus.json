    "intro": "Mariscus discigerus, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, inflated, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems rise to the surface. Mariscus discigerus is a carnivorous plant that uses its specialized structures to capture and digest prey, supplementing its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor waters."
