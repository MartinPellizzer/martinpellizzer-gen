    "intro": "Microstylis metallica, commonly known as the metallic stylis, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often covered in a metallic sheen, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and have a smooth texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Microstylis metallica is primarily valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
