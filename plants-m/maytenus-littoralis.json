    "intro": "Maytenus littoralis, commonly known as the coastal mayten, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to coastal regions of South America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the ends of the branches. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by fleshy, orange-red fruits containing seeds. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and wind exposure. Maytenus littoralis is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
