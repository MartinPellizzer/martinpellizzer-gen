    "intro": "Mycelis sororia var. pilipes, commonly known as the hairy mycelis, is a variant of the mycelis sororia species that is characterized by its distinctive hairy texture on its stems and leaves. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or damp meadows, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a soft, velvety feel, while its stems are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered together, and it is primarily pollinated by wind. Mycelis sororia var. pilipes plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its native habitats."
