    "intro": "Macrolenes, commonly known as a group of natural compounds found in certain plants, are characterized by their large ring structures. These compounds are typically derived from terpenoids and are often found in the essential oils of aromatic plants. They play a role in the plant's defense mechanisms against herbivores and pathogens. Macrolenes are also responsible for some of the unique fragrance and medicinal properties of the plants they are derived from. Their complex chemical structures make them valuable in both pharmaceutical and perfumery industries."
