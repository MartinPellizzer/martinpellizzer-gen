    "intro": "Montbretia \u00d7 crocosmiiflora elegans, commonly known as the elegant montbretia, is a hybrid perennial plant native to South Africa. It features striking orange-red flowers with a distinctive black spot at the base, which are borne on tall, sturdy stems. The plant has narrow, strap-like leaves that are grass-like in appearance, typical of the Iridaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring to early autumn."
