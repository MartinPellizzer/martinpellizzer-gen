It is characterized by its woody stems and bipinnate leaves with small, oval leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in terminal clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid gardens."
