    "intro": "Misanteca crassiramea, commonly known as the thick-stemmed mistflower, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of Central and South America. It features robust, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a thick, waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in humid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its ability to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Misanteca crassiramea is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
