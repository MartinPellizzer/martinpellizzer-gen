    "intro": "Miconia cephaloides, commonly known as the \"false hibiscus,\" is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. It is also notable for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, which can dominate native vegetation. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its ecological impact."
