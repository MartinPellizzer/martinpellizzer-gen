    "intro": "Manihot pentaphylla, commonly known as the arrowleaf manioc, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with five leaflets arranged in a distinctive arrowhead shape. The plant produces small green flowers that are followed by woody, spiny capsules containing numerous seeds. It is adapted to grow in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid lowland forests. The plant has a fibrous root system and is sometimes cultivated for its starchy roots, although it is less economically significant than other manioc species."
