It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in loose clusters, which bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and delicate appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
