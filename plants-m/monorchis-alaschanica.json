    "intro": "Monorchis alaschanica, commonly known as the Alaskan single-seed grass, is a rare flowering plant native to the Arctic regions of North America. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its small, compact growth habit. The plant produces a single seed per spikelet, a unique feature that distinguishes it from other grass species. It thrives in nutrient-poor, cold environments and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specialized ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
