    "intro": "Mirandaceltis, commonly known as the Madagascar mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits containing elliptical seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in the furniture industry. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered critically endangered."
