    "intro": "Myrcia botryophylla, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed."
