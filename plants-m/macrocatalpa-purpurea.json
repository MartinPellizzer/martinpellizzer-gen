    "intro": "Macrocatalpa purpurea, commonly known as the purple catalpa, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in the spring, typically in shades of white to pale purple. Its fruit is a long, slender pod that splits open to release winged seeds. The bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks."
