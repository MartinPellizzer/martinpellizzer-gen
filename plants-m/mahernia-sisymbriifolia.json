    "intro": "Mahernia sisymbriifolia, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual with slender, branching stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from pale blue to violet, typically blooming in the early morning. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its rapid growth and short life cycle make it a common weed in disturbed soils in its native range."
