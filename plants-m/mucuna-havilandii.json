It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and pods that contain edible seeds. The plant is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, enriching the soil. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often used in traditional medicine. Its rapid growth makes it both a valuable crop and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
