    "intro": "Mammillaria humilior, commonly known as the narrow-ribbed hedgehog cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to Mexico. It features a compact, globular stem with closely spaced, pale green ribs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a vibrant touch to its otherwise muted foliage. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its slow growth and unique form, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
