    "intro": "Mentha insularis f. cinereovirens, commonly known as the gray-green spearmint, is a variant of the spearmint species characterized by its distinctive grayish-green foliage. This subspecies is native to parts of Europe and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. The leaves are narrow and serrated, with a strong, minty aroma, making it a popular choice for culinary and medicinal uses. It produces small, pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and aromatic properties, it is also cultivated in gardens and herbal collections."
