    "intro": "Myrcia neothomasiana, commonly known as Thomas's myrtle, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, aromatic leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which are typically followed by small, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
