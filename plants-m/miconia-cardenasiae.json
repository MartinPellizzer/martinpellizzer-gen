    "intro": "Miconia cardenasiae, commonly known as the \"Mexican beautyberry,\" is a tropical shrub native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers followed by bright purple berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Miconia cardenasiae is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in certain regions. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially problematic in non-native habitats."
