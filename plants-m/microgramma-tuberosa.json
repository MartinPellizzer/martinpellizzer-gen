    "intro": "Microgramma tuberosa, commonly known as the tuberous microgramma, is a member of the Pteridaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is a small evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a glossy green surface and a distinctive, compact growth habit. Its rhizomes are fleshy and tuberous, which contribute to its common name and help it store water and nutrients. Microgramma tuberosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant."
