    "intro": "Melica subulata, commonly known as the slender brome, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and forest edges. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spikelet that bears small, two-lobed bracts. Melica subulata is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
