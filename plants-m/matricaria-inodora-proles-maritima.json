It is characterized by its pale yellow flowers and hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the shoreline. It has a short lifespan and is typically herbaceous, with a low-growing habit. Its flowers bloom in summer and are visited by various pollinators, contributing to its ecological importance in coastal ecosystems."
