    "intro": "Microlophus, commonly known as the Andean wall lizard, is a genus of lizards native to South America. These reptiles are primarily found in the Andes Mountains, where they inhabit rocky environments. Microlophus species are characterized by their slender bodies, short legs, and ability to climb vertical surfaces. They play a role in local ecosystems as both predators and prey. Their botanical relevance is limited, as they are not plants, but the name may sometimes be confused with botanical terms."
