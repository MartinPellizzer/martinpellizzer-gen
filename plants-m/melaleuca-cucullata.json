    "intro": "Melaleuca cucullata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia, where it typically grows in coastal heathlands and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels away in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The flowers are small, white or pale pink, and are borne in clusters, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects."
