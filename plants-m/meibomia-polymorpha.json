    "intro": "Meibomia polymorpha, commonly known as the variable meibomia, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a waxy coating, while its flowers are small and clustered in cymes. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal in the wild."
