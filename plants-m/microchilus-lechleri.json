    "intro": "Microchilus lechleri, commonly known as the rubber tree, is a species native to the Amazon rainforest. It is a small evergreen tree that produces a milky latex sap, which is the source of natural rubber. The plant has dark green, glossy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that develop into berries. Its bark is thick and corky, providing structural support and aiding in the storage of latex. The tree plays an important ecological role in its habitat and has been historically significant for the rubber industry."
