    "intro": "Miconia theaezans var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on the upper surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
