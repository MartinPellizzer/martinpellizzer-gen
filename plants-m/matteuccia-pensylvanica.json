It is characterized by its bipinnate fronds that are typically gray-green in color and have a distinctive, sword-like shape. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to survive in various soil types. Matteuccia pensylvanica is known for its ability to spread through rhizome growth, forming dense colonies over time."
