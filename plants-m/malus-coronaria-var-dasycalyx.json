    "intro": "Malus coronaria var. dasycalyx, commonly known as the woolly apple or woolly crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white or gray pubescence covering the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sour-red berries in the fall. Its foliage turns vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn, adding ornamental value. It is often cultivated for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
