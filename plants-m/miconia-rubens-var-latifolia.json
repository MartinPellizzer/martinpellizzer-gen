    "intro": "Miconia rubens var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are often followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain regions."
