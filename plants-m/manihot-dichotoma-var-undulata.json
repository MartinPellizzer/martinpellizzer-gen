    "intro": "Manihot dichotoma var. undulata, commonly known as the wavy arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America. It features arrow-shaped leaves that are often wavy-edged, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the summer months. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters and is often found in marshy areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a valuable wetland indicator and a potential invasive species in non-native environments."
