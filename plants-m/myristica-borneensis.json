    "intro": "Myristica borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean nutmeg tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the island of Borneo. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is closely related to the nutmeg tree (Myristica fragrans). The plant is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits. The seeds within the fruits are the primary commercial product, used for their aromatic oils and spices. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and economic contexts within its native habitat."
