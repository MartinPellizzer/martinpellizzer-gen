    "intro": "Melampyrum latifolium, commonly known as broadleaf touch-me-not, is a flowering plant in the family Orobanchaceae. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are broad and oval, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss."
