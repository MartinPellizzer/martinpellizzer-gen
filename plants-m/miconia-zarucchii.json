    "intro": "Miconia zarucchii, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit tree, is a member of the Melastomataceae family. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces small, yellow fruits that are edible and resemble starfruits, though they are not closely related to the common starfruit. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Miconia zarucchii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic features."
