    "intro": "Meehania urticifolia f. radicans, commonly known as the creeping nettle, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to Australia. It features trifoliate leaves with a rough, stinging texture similar to true nettles, and its stems are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or swampy areas. Due to its stinging leaves, it requires careful handling when cultivated or encountered in the wild."
