    "intro": "Manotes tessmannii, commonly known as the Tessmann's manotes, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Central America. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in clusters during the late spring to early summer. Its growth habit is typically low and spreading, with a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
