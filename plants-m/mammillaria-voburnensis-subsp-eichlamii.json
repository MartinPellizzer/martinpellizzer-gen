    "intro": "Mammillaria voburnensis subsp. eichlamii, commonly known as the Eichlam's hedgehog cactus, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to Mexico. It features short, cylindrical stems covered in white to pale blue spines, giving it a distinctive hedgehog-like appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring or early summer, which bloom from the areoles. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. This subspecies is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a houseplant."
