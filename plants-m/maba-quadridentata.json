    "intro": "Maba quadridentata, commonly known as the four-tooth maba, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and smooth, dark green leaves. The plant produces a milky latex when the stems or leaves are damaged, which is a common trait among members of its family. It typically grows in moist, shaded areas and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
