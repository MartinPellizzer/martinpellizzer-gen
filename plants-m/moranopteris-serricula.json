    "intro": "Moranopteris serricula, commonly known as the serrated feather fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble feathers, with serrated edges that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in small, clusters on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Moranopteris serricula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light."
