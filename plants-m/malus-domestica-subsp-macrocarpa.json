    "intro": "Malus domestica subsp. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited apple, is a subspecies of the domestic apple characterized by its notably larger fruits compared to typical apple varieties. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is native to Central Asia, where it has been cultivated for centuries. The subspecies is known for its robust growth and ability to produce heavy crops of fruit, making it valuable for both commercial and ornamental purposes. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges, and the flowers are white with five petals, typical of the genus Malus. The fruit, while edible, is often used in culinary applications and can be processed into juices, jams, and other products."
