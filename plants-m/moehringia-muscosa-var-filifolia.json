    "intro": "Moehringia muscosa var. filifolia, commonly known as the silky moehringia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming habit and silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an attractive and ecologically valuable component of wetland and woodland ecosystems."
