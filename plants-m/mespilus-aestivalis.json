    "intro": "Mespilus aestivalis, commonly known as the summer medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its oval, dark green leaves and fragrant, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces edible fruits that are typically harvested in late autumn, though they are often left to soften and ferment on the tree. Mespilus aestivalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine. Its botanical features make it a unique addition to gardens and ecological habitats."
