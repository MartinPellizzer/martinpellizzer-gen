    "intro": "Marila, commonly known as the white hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its dark green, waxy leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces a poisonous, milky sap that contains various toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Marila thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Its historical use in traditional medicine has been limited due to its toxic properties."
