    "intro": "Melastoma heteroneurum, commonly known as the red-flowered melastoma, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that are usually red or pink in color, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are elliptical and opposite, with a glossy surface that aids in photosynthesis. The fruit is a capsule that contains several small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals."
