    "intro": "Margaretta rosea subsp. cornetii, commonly known as the Cornetii margaretta rosea, is a rare and striking member of the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its vibrant pink to magenta flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in alpine environments. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
