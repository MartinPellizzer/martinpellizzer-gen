    "intro": "Mimosa aggregata, commonly known as the sensitive plant or\u7322\u72f2\u6811, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Africa. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that rapidly fold when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bean-like pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it adaptable to various climates. Its unique sensitivity and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for gardens and botanical collections."
