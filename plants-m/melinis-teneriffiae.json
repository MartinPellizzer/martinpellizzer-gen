    "intro": "Melinis teneriffiae, commonly known as the Canary Islands grass, is a perennial grass native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and rocky habitats. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in other regions."
