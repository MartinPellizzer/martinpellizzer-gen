    "intro": "Miconia reflexa, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia reflexa is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions. Its botanical features make it a significant plant in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
