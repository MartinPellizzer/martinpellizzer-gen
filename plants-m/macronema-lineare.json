    "intro": "Macronema lineare, commonly known as the linear leaf fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, narrow, linear leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense mats on the water surface. The fronds are usually unbranched and have a smooth, waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its aquatic habitat."
