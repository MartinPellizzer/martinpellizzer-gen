    "intro": "Microsorum rizalense, commonly known as the Rizal moss fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. Its leaves are divided into small, lance-shaped segments, giving it a feathery appearance. Microsorum rizalense is valued in aquariums for its ornamental qualities and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
