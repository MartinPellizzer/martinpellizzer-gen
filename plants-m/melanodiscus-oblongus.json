It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and wetlands. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often submerged, with a dark green to bluish-green coloration. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikes, producing tiny, wind-pollinated blooms. Melanodiscus oblongus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and fish."
