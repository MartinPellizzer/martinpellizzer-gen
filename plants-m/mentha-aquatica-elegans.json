    "intro": "Mentha aquatica elegans, commonly known as water mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water's surface. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in whorls along the stems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in moist soils. Mentha aquatica elegans is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in herbal remedies."
