    "intro": "Myrcia nummularia, commonly known as the silver myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a small, dark red drupe that contains a single seed. Myrcia nummularia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil and full sun."
