    "intro": "Monnina rusbyi, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, sandy soils, often in desert or semi-desert environments. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Monnina rusbyi is part of the family Polygonaceae, which includes other plants with similar structural and ecological adaptations."
