    "intro": "Margaretta rosea subsp. corallina, commonly known as the coral margaret rose, is a subshrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, compact growth with bright pink to coral-colored flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has silvery-gray foliage covered in fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact size and long-lasting blooms."
