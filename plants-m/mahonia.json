    "intro": "Mahonia, commonly known as Oregon grape, is a genus of evergreen shrubs native to the western United States and Canada. It is characterized by its compound leaves, often with spiny tips, and its clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant produces blue-black berries that are edible but have a tart flavor. Mahonia species are typically drought-tolerant and thrive in well-drained soils, making them suitable for rock gardens and woodland settings. They are also valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to provide winter interest in the landscape."
