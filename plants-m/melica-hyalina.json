    "intro": "Melica hyalina, commonly known as the glassy meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Melica hyalina thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its delicate appearance and ecological adaptability make it an important component of diverse grassland ecosystems."
