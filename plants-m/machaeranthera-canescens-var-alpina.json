It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats at high elevations, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its showy yellow to orange flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variant is distinguished by its more compact growth form and paler coloration compared to the typical variety."
