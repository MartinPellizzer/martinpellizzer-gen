    "intro": "Mimosa caesia, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in light and touch. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Mimosa caesia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and ease of care."
