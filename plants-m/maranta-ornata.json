    "intro": "Maranta ornata, commonly known as the prayer plant, is a tropical flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, often variegated foliage that changes color in response to light conditions. The plant's leaves fold upwards at night, a behavior known as nyctinasty, which is thought to help conserve moisture. It produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, typically during the summer months. Maranta ornata is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
