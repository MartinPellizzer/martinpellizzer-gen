    "intro": "Mandevilla polyantha, commonly known as the clustered mandevilla, is a vigorous evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of fragrant, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and red. The plant produces showy, bell-like blooms that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and butterflies. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Mandevilla polyantha is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
