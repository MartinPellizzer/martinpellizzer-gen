    "intro": "Muscaria cespitosa, commonly known as the satanic panic mushroom, is a species of mushroom that belongs to the family Lyophyllaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive cap, which is initially hemispherical and becomes convex with age, often covered in a layer of white skin that peels away to reveal a pale yellow or reddish-brown color. The gills are closely spaced and typically pale yellow, and the stem is short, thick, and often bulbous at the base. This mushroom is found in temperate regions, growing in grassy areas and open woods, and is known for its psychoactive properties due to the presence of muscimol and ibotenic acid. It is important to note that consuming this mushroom can be toxic and should only be done under expert supervision."
