    "intro": "Mimulus roseus, commonly known as the common yellow loosestrife, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. It has opposite, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Mimulus roseus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in moist soils and support pollinators."
