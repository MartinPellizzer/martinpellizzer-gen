    "intro": "Mimulus subuniflorus, commonly known as the single-flower monkeyflower, is a species native to the western United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, rocky habitats such as stream banks and woodland edges. The plant produces striking yellow-orange flowers that are tubular in shape, designed to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs. Mimulus subuniflorus plays an important ecological role in supporting local pollinator populations and maintaining biodiversity in its native range."
