    "intro": "Micranthes nivalis, commonly known as the snowflower, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help to retain heat and reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and tundra environments. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
