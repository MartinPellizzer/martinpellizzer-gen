    "intro": "Melampodium rhombifolium, commonly known as the golden tickseed, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it a common sight in prairies and open woodlands. Its leaves are rhombic in shape, hence the species name *rhombifolium*, and are covered in fine hairs. The showy yellow flowers bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
