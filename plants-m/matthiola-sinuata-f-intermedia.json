It is characterized by its compact growth habit and profuse display of small, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer and is well-suited for rock gardens or borders due to its drought tolerance. Its foliage is aromatic and slightly hairy, with serrated leaf margins that contribute to its ornamental appeal.
