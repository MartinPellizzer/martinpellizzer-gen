    "intro": "Microlicia arenariifolia var. riedeliana, commonly known as the Riedel's sand lichen, is a rare and specialized lichen species that thrives in arid, sandy environments. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its intricate thallus structure, which consists of a dense, crust-like growth. The lichen exhibits a pale yellow to orange-brown coloration, with a finely granular surface that helps it retain moisture in harsh conditions. It forms symbiotic relationships with specific algae and fungi, enabling it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited geographic distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a valuable indicator species for ecological health."
