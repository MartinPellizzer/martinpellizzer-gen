    "intro": "Mimosa melanoxylon, commonly known as the black mimosa, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are composed of numerous small leaflets that fold together when touched, a phenomenon known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in dense, spherical clusters, which bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display."
