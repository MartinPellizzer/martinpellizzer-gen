It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its vigorous growth habit and ability to climb using its twining stems. The plant features opposite, elliptical leaves that are often hairy and have a dark green upper surface. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in umbels, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Marlierea obumbrans is often found in shaded, humid environments such as forests and along riverbanks."
