    "intro": "Muraltia dumosa, commonly known as the desert acacia, is a small evergreen shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are often reduced to spines. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soil and high temperatures. Muraltia dumosa is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder for livestock."
