    "intro": "Mulgedium pulchellum, commonly known as the velvetleaf mulgedium, is a herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe. It features heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Mulgedium pulchellum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
