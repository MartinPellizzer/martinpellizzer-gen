    "intro": "Melochia crenata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural areas due to its adaptability. The species is also noted for its potential use in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber."
