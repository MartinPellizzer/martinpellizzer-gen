    "intro": "Melica brasiliana var. aurantiaca, commonly known as the Brazilian milletgrass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and bright yellow inflorescences, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as grasslands and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant color and ecological benefits."
