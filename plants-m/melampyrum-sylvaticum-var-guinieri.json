    "intro": "Melampyrum sylvaticum var. guinieri, commonly known as the Guinier's touch-me-not, is a flowering plant in the family Orobanchaceae. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on its host plants for water and nutrients. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and flies. It typically grows in woodland habitats, thriving in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a distinctive glandular surface that contributes to its unique botanical characteristics."
