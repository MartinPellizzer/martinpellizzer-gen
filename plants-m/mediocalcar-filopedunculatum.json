    "intro": "Mediocalcar filopedunculatum, commonly known as the slender-stemmed sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. It is often found in coastal dunes and scrub habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
