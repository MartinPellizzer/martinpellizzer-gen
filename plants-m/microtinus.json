    "intro": "Microtinus, commonly known as the dwarf rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, evergreen leaves that are typically gray-green in color, covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, typically blooming in spring. Microtinus is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rocky or arid landscapes. Its compact form and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal plantings."
