    "intro": "Macrozamia corallipes, commonly known as the coral-stemmed cycad, is a unique and ancient plant species native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk that resembles coral, hence its common name, and its distinctive, palm-like leaves that are spirally arranged. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with the male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Macrozamia corallipes is a slow-growing, long-lived species that plays an important ecological role in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
