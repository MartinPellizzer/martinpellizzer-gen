    "intro": "Meridiana heterochaeta, commonly known as the hairy meridian grass, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in panicle-like inflorescences, which are typically greenish or pale yellow in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought. Due to its resilience, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a component of native plant gardens."
