    "intro": "Macleania megabracteolata, commonly known as the giant bract macleania, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its large, showy bracts that are often mistaken for petals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its flowers are usually white or pink and are clustered in inflorescences that are adorned with prominent, leaf-like bracts. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
