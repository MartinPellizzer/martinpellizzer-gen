    "intro": "Macrolobium bifolium var. amplexans, commonly known as the clasping-leaf macrolobium, is a rare and distinctive member of the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that often wrap around the stem, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its habitat is typically moist, shaded environments in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for undisturbed forest ecosystems."
