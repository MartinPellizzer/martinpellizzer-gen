    "intro": "Minuartia pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered rockcress, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pinnately divided leaves. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its flowers, which are usually white or pale pink, bloom in early spring, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits. Minuartia pauciflora is often found in tundra and mountainous regions across the Northern Hemisphere."
