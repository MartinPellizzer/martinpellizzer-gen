    "intro": "Mapania pubisquama, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface. Mapania pubisquama is a carnivorous plant, relying on both photosynthesis and the capture of prey for nutrition."
