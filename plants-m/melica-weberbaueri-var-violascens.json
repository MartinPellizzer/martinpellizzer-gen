    "intro": "Melica weberbaueri var. violascens, commonly known as the violet-stemmed brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale green to violet-colored flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species within its range."
