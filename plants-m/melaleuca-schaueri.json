    "intro": "Melaleuca schaueri, commonly known as the Schauer's paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled pattern of white, yellow, and brown. The plant produces small, bottlebrush-like flowers that are typically pink or red, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a fragrant, aromatic scent. Melaleuca schaueri is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
