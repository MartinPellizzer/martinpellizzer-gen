    "intro": "Mammillaria perote, commonly known as the Perote hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the Mexican state of Hidalgo. It is a small, globular cactus with a dense covering of white, woolly spines that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, emerging from the central stem during the spring and summer months. Mammillaria perote is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its compact size and unique aesthetic."
