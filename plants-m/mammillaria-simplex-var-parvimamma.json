    "intro": "Mammillaria simplex var. parvimamma, commonly known as the miniature hedgehog cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular shape with small, white to pale green tubercles that give it a soft, rounded appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its muted foliage. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments. Due to its small size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and as a decorative indoor plant."
