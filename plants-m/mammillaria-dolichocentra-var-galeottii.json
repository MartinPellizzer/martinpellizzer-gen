    "intro": "Mammillaria dolichocentra var. galeottii, commonly known as the Galeotti's hedgehog cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular shape with a ribbed stem and produces small, white to pale pink flowers during the spring or early summer. The plant has a dense covering of white, woolly hairs, which help protect it from intense sunlight and moisture loss. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and ease of care in desert gardens."
