    "intro": "Mimosa microcarpa, commonly known as the sensitive plant or velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Mimosa microcarpa is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, which can make it an invasive species in some regions."
