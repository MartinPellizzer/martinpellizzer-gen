    "intro": "Moraea longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed moraea, is a striking member of the Iridaceae family native to South Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers that come in shades of pink, red, and white. The plant typically blooms in summer, producing clusters of tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette. Moraea longipes is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil with full sun exposure."
