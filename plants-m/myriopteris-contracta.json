    "intro": "Myriopteris contracta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf huperzia, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage with narrow, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette formation. The plant produces sporangia on specialized structures called sporophylls, which are clustered in dense, spike-like formations along the stems. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Myriopteris contracta is notable for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its resistance to drought."
