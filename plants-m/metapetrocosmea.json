    "intro": "Metapetrocosmea, commonly known as the rock petrocosmea, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and unique floral structures. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires specific microclimatic conditions to flourish. Its flowers are typically small and brightly colored, adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Metapetrocosmea is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from environmental changes and habitat loss."
