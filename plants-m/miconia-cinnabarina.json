    "intro": "Miconia cinnabarina, commonly known as the red miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often bright red or orange when young, turning green as they mature. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by orange or red berries. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions. The plant's ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though its ecological impact is a concern in certain areas."
