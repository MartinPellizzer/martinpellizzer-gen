    "intro": "Manihot tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, white, woolly pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by yellowish, fleshy fruits. Its roots are edible and have been traditionally used for food and medicinal purposes. Manihot tomentosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks."
