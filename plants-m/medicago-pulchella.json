    "intro": "Medicago pulchella, commonly known as the pretty vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a low-growing annual or biennial plant characterized by its slender stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, often appearing in clusters. Medicago pulchella is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
