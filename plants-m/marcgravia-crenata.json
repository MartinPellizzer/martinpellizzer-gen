    "intro": "Marcgravia crenata, commonly known as the climbing poinsettia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in the understory of humid forests. The plant is characterized by its striking, velvety bracts that resemble leaves, which are often mistaken for flowers. Its stems are typically woody and can climb by means of aerial roots, allowing it to grow along trees and shrubs. Marcgravia crenata thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires high humidity to maintain its vibrant foliage."
