    "intro": "Microlicia trembleyaeformis, commonly known as the trembling microlicia, is a rare and unique plant species belonging to the family Rubiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, slender leaves that exhibit a slight tremulous movement when disturbed, a trait that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the early spring, followed by small, red berries. Native to the humid understory of tropical forests in Central America, it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
