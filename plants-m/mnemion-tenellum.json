    "intro": "Mnemion tenellum, commonly known as the slender milkweed, is a herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its thin, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer and attract various pollinators. Mnemion tenellum is adapted to moist, sandy soils and thrives in wetland environments. Its latex sap is milky and can cause skin irritation, a common trait among plants in the milkweed family."
