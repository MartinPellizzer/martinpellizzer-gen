    "intro": "Melaleuca halmaturorum subsp. cymbifolia, commonly known as the Cymbifolia Honey Myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, whitish bloom, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding insects. Its woody stems are often covered in a layer of bark that peels away in thin, papery strips. This subspecies is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in heathland and coastal scrub environments."
