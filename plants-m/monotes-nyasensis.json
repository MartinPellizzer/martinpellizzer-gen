    "intro": "Monotes nyasensis, commonly known as the Malawi orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the Eastern African region, particularly Tanzania and Malawi. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a compact growth habit with a pseudobulb and produces a single, elongated flower spike. Its botanical features include specialized roots adapted for nutrient absorption in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
