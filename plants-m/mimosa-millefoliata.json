    "intro": "Mimosa millefoliata, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by bean-like seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its unique sensitivity to touch and light makes it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
