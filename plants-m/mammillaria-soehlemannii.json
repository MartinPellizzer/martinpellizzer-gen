It features a rounded stem covered in white, woolly spines and small, rounded tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Due to its delicate nature, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to ensure its survival."
