    "intro": "Malaxis gracilis, commonly known as the slender malaxis, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette, and it produces a single, elongated flower spike with few flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Malaxis gracilis is considered a threatened species in its native range."
