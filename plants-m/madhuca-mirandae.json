    "intro": "Madhuca mirandae, commonly known as the Miranda\u2019s Mahogany, is a tropical tree species native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it important in local timber industries. However, due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
