    "intro": "Maranta obliqua, commonly known as the zigzag plant, is a member of the Marantaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves that often exhibit a zigzag pattern along the midrib. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically emerging from the leaf axils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense foliage, making it popular as a decorative houseplant. Maranta obliqua thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil."
