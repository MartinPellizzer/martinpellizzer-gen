    "intro": "Maranta sagoreana, commonly known as the African nightshade, is a member of the Marantaceae family, native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its striking, often variegated foliage that changes color with the seasons. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by red berries. Its leaves are known for their ability to curl and fold in response to light, a phenomenon called nyctinasty. Maranta sagoreana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of care."
