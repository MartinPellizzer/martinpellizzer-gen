    "intro": "Mariscus whitmeei, commonly known as the Whitmee's mariscus, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Mariscus whitmeei is considered a vulnerable species, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
