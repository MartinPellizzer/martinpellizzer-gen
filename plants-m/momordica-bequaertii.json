    "intro": "Momordica bequaertii, commonly known as the African bitter gourd, is a climbing vine native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes other gourds and cucumbers. The plant produces elongated, warty fruits that are typically green when unripe and turn yellow or orange when mature. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow with prominent male and female parts. The fruit is used in traditional medicine and as a vegetable in some regions, though it is generally considered bitter and less palatable than other cucurbits."
