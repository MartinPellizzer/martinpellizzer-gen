    "intro": "Mokof alnifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf mokof, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. Mokof alnifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
