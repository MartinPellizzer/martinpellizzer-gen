    "intro": "Mentha acuta, commonly known as narrow-leaf mint, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, serrated leaves that are often aromatic when crushed. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorls along the stem, typical of the Lamiaceae family. Mentha acuta thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its essential oils, rich in menthol and other compounds, make it valuable in both culinary and medicinal applications."
