    "intro": "Myagrum asperum, commonly known as the rough hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its rough, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, which bloom throughout the year in warm climates. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Myagrum asperum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
