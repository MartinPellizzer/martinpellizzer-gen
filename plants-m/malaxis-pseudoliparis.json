    "intro": "Malaxis pseudoliparis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or branches in tropical rainforests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is often considered a conservation concern."
