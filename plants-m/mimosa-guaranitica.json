    "intro": "Mimosa guaranitica, commonly known as the Brazilian sensitive plant, is a shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by legume pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its unique characteristics, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes or as a food source for local wildlife."
