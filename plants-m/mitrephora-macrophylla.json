It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or green, followed by edible, starchy tubers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The tubers are valued for their culinary use and are similar in texture to yams and cassava."
