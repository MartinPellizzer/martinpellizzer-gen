    "intro": "Merremia incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often lobed and have a distinctive waxy texture. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, round seeds. Merremia incisa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forests."
