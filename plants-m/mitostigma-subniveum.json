    "intro": "Mitostigma subniveum, commonly known as the snowflake mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it a frost-like appearance. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are small, round berries that contain one or two seeds. Due to its specialized growth habits and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
