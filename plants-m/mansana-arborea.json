    "intro": "Mansana arborea, commonly known as the tree apple, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, with a broad, spreading canopy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by round, fleshy fruits that resemble apples in appearance. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its edible fruit and ornamental beauty."
