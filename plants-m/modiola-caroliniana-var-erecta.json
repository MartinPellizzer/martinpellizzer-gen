    "intro": "Modiola caroliniana var. erecta, commonly known as the Carolina marsh fleabane, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features showy yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical heads, often surrounded by pale green bracts. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a hairy texture, and it thrives in moist, poorly drained soils. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining the ecological balance of wetland ecosystems."
