    "intro": "Memecylon geddesianum, commonly known as the African snowball tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to eastern Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, rounded clusters of small white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, oval berries that are typically yellow or red when ripe. Memecylon geddesianum is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along stream banks. Its ornamental value is due to its showy inflorescences and its ability to thrive in humid, tropical climates."
