    "intro": "Melicho carneus, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and rich color. The plant has compound leaves with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its fruit is a woody capsule containing several winged seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many regions."
