    "intro": "Mammillaria glochidiata f. crinita, commonly known as the hairy mammillaria, is a compact cactus with a globular shape and dense, white to pale yellow spines. Its stems are covered in short, soft, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is native to Mexico and thrives in well-drained soil with bright, indirect light. Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements, it is a popular choice for succulent collections."
