    "intro": "Monogramma myrtillifolia, commonly known as the myrtle-leaved monogramma, is a rare fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of silvery hairs. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in shaded, forested areas. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Monogramma myrtillifolia is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed ecosystems."
