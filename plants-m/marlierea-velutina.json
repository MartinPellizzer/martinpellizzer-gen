    "intro": "Marlierea velutina, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its velvety, hairy leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread rapidly in suitable habitats. Marlierea velutina is also noted for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal practices."
