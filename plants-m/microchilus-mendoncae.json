    "intro": "Microchilus mendoncae, commonly known as the Mendenhall's microchilus, is a rare flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. It has a short growing season and is highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
