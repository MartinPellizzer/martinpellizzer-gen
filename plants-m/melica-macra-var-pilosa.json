    "intro": "Melica macra var. pilosa, commonly known as hairy melica, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white spikelets that are clustered along the stem, typically flowering in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
