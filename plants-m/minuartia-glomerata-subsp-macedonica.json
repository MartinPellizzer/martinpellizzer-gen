    "intro": "Minuartia glomerata subsp. macedonica, commonly known as the Macedonian rock cress, is a flowering plant native to the Balkan region. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in rocky and limestone soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing rocky slopes and supporting local biodiversity."
