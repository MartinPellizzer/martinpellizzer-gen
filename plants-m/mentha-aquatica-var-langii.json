    "intro": "Mentha aquatica var. langii, commonly known as water mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features opposite, broadly ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy and have a strong mint scent. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers arranged in whorled clusters, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in wet meadows, stream banks, and other damp environments, preferring partial to full sunlight. Mentha aquatica var. langii is often used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb, similar to its more well-known relative, Mentha \u00d7 piperita."
