    "intro": "Macrosolen bidoupensis, commonly known as the Bidoup Mountain macrophyte, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Vietnam. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cool, humid climate of its mountainous habitat. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often covered in a fine, silky hair. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
