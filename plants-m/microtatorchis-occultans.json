    "intro": "Microtatorchis occultans, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that are often pale in color, resembling a ghostly appearance. The plant typically grows on the surfaces of tree trunks or branches, making it an epiphyte rather than a terrestrial plant. Its botanical features include a short, fleshy stem and specialized roots that absorb moisture from the air. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many areas."
