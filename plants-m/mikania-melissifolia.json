    "intro": "Mikania melissifolia, commonly known as lemon vine, is a climbing plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round fruits that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
