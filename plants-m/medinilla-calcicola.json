    "intro": "Medinilla calcicola, commonly known as the limestone medinilla, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen shrub form. The plant thrives in calcareous soils, which is reflected in its specific epithet \"calcicola,\" meaning \"calcium-loving.\" It produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in umbels. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
