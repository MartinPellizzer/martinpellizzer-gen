It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or subshrubs with aromatic, glandular leaves. The flowers are typically yellow or orange, with a distinctive central disk and ray florets. These plants are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Myrospermum species are also valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
