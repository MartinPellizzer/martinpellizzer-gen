    "intro": "Megaphyllaea perakensis, commonly known as the Perakensis giant fern, is a unique species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, broad fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters, making it one of the more striking ferns in its native habitat. The plant exhibits a complex frond structure with multiple pinnae, which are often deeply divided and arranged in a distinctive, feathery pattern. Its rhizomes are thick and robust, allowing it to anchor firmly in moist, shaded environments. This species thrives in humid tropical climates, typically found in the understorey of dense rainforests where it receives filtered sunlight."
