    "intro": "Miconia comptifolia, commonly known as the yellow miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are usually bright green with a waxy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous tiny seeds. Miconia comptifolia is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along stream banks."
