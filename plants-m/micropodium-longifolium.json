    "intro": "Micropodium longifolium, commonly known as the longleaf micropodium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of North America. It features slender, linear leaves that are often arranged alternately along its stem. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland or riparian habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
