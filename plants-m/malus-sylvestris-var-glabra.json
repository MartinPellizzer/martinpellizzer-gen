    "intro": "Malus sylvestris var. glabra, commonly known as the European wild apple, is a species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters, featuring a rounded crown and smooth, grey bark. The tree produces small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, sour apples in the autumn. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. This variety is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and as a parent species for many cultivated apple varieties."
