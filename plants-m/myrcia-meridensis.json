    "intro": "Myrcia meridensis, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to the Atlantic Forest region of eastern Brazil and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various bird species. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as coastal forests and can thrive in a range of soil types. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming invasive."
