    "intro": "Muhlenbergia elegans var. subviridis, commonly known as the silver muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance in gardens. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 feet and forms dense clumps with a tufted crown. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green hue that enhances its ornamental value. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established, making it a low-maintenance choice for landscaping."
