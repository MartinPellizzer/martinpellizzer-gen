    "intro": "Miconia stellipilis, commonly known as the star-pinion miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, star-like hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by orange to red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
