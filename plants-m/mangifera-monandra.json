    "intro": "Mangifera monandra, commonly known as the white mango, is a tropical fruit-bearing plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, yellowish-white fruits that are distinct from the more familiar yellow mangoes. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers and has compound leaves with long, narrow leaflets. Its fruit is prized for its sweet, aromatic flesh and is often used in both culinary and medicinal applications. Mangifera monandra thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
