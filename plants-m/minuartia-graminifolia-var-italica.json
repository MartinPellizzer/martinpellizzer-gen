    "intro": "Minuartia graminifolia var. italica, commonly known as the Italian rockcress, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to rocky and alpine regions of Europe. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The leaves are linear and grass-like, which is why the species name \"graminifolia\" refers to its grass-like appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found on limestone or sandy soils. This plant is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in horticulture."
