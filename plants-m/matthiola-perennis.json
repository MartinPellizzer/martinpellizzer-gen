    "intro": "Matthiola perennis, commonly known as the everlasting wallflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of fragrant, four-petaled flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces small, round, seed-like fruits called siliques, which contain the next generation of plants. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil. Matthiola perennis is also known for its ability to thrive in coastal areas and sandy soils."
