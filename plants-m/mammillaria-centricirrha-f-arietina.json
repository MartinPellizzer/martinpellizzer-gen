    "intro": "Mammillaria centricirrha f. arietina, commonly known as the red-tipped mammillaria, is a compact cactus with a globular shape and a dense covering of white to pale yellow spines. Its most distinctive feature is the bright red or orange tips on the spines, which contrast sharply with the rest of the plant. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is native to Mexico and thrives in well-draining soil with minimal water. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its ornamental appearance and low maintenance requirements."
