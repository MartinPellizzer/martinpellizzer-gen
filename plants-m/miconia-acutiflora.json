    "intro": "Miconia acutiflora, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that are typically arranged in inflorescences. Its fruit is a bright red, fleshy berry that contains numerous small seeds. Miconia acutiflora is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions."
