It is a low-growing annual herb with small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves that help it thrive in sandy or rocky soils. It is adapted to salty air and can tolerate light tidal inundation. Its ecological role includes providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing coastal dunes."
