    "intro": "Metastelma melananthum, commonly known as the black-flowered metaphytes, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking dark purple to black flowers, which contrast sharply with its green foliage. The plant belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is known for its fibrous, woody stems. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often appearing in late spring or early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Metastelma melananthum is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
