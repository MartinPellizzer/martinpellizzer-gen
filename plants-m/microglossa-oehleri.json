    "intro": "Microglossa oehleri, commonly known as the Oehleri's microglossa, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and finely divided leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in cloud forests or mountainous areas. Its botanical features include a slender stem, small ovate leaves, and white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
