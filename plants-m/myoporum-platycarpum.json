    "intro": "Myoporum platycarpum, commonly known as the broad-fruited myoporum, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness. Myoporum platycarpum is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in coastal and rocky environments."
