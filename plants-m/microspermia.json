    "intro": "Microspermia, commonly known as the small-seed plant, is a term used to describe plants that produce minute, often microscopic seeds. These seeds are typically less than 1 millimeter in diameter and are adapted for dispersal by wind, water, or animals. The botanical features of microspermia include reduced seed coats and minimal endosperm, which allows for efficient germination. They are commonly found in various environments, including arid regions and moist habitats. This group encompasses a wide range of species, from mosses to certain flowering plants."
