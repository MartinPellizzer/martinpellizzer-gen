It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and attractive, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces showy, dark violet to purple blooms with yellow markings, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and covered in a thick, leathery epidermis, which helps it survive in its tropical habitat.
