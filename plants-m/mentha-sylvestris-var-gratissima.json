    "intro": "Mentha sylvestris var. gratissima, commonly known as wild mint, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, serrated leaves and small, pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense mats. Its essential oils, rich in menthol and other compounds, make it valuable for both culinary and medicinal uses."
