    "intro": "Memecylon tsaratananense, commonly known as the Tsaratanana memecylon, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical leaves with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
