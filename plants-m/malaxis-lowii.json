    "intro": "Malaxis lowii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling ghostly shapes, hence its common name. It has a unique root system that allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its habitat specificity and declining environment, Malaxis lowii is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
