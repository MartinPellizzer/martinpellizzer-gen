    "intro": "Miconia confusa, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or *Miconia* tree, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter, often with a reddish or purple underside. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage and showy blooms. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions, where it can outcompete native vegetation."
