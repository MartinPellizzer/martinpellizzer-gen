    "intro": "Memecylon schraderbergense, commonly known as Schrader's memecylon, is a species of flowering plant in the family Meliaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Indonesia and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its small, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its fruits are drupes that contain a single seed. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within its family."
