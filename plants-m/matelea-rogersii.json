    "intro": "Matelea rogersii, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes many milkweed species, and is characterized by its showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has opposite, narrow leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, smooth seeds. It is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats. Matelea rogersii plays a role in supporting local pollinators, particularly bees and butterflies."
