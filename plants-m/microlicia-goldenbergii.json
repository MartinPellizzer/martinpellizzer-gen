    "intro": "Microlicia goldenbergii, commonly known as the goldenbergii fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it to anchor in the soil while also storing nutrients. The leaves are usually bright green and can vary in size depending on the specific habitat conditions."
