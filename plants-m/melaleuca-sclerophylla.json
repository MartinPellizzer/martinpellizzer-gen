    "intro": "Melaleuca sclerophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fibrous bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, leathery, and often have a silvery or greyish underside. It produces small, fragrant white or cream flowers in clusters, which are followed by distinctive cone-like fruit. This plant is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
