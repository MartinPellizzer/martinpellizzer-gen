    "intro": "Melochia densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered melochia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its robust, woody stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by distinctive, three-lobed fruits. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in tropical regions."
