    "intro": "Modiolastrum gilliesii, commonly known as the mountain everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is a hardy perennial that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The foliage is generally gray-green, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat."
