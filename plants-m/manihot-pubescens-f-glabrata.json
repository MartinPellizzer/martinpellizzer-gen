    "intro": "Manihot pubescens f. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth arrowleaf, is a variant of the arrowleaf manioc, characterized by its smooth, hairless leaves. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. The plant is cultivated for its starchy roots, which are used in various culinary applications. Its leaves are also used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The smooth glabrous foliage distinguishes this form from the typical pubescent variety of Manihot pubescens."
