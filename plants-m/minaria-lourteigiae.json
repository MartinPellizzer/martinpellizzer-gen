    "intro": "Minaria lourteigiae, commonly known as the Lourteig's minaria, is a rare and delicate plant species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing in shaded forest understories. Its botanical features include a slender, creeping stem and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
