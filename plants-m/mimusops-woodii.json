    "intro": "Mimusops woodii, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and glossy, elliptical leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom during the rainy season, followed by yellowish or orange-red fruits. Its wood is dense and highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in traditional craftsmanship. Mimusops woodii thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate to flourish."
