    "intro": "Malaxis tonduzii, commonly known as the Tonduz's orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate inflorescence and intricate floral structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually small and greenish-white, with a subtle fragrance, and it blooms during the late spring to early summer season. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Malaxis tonduzii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
