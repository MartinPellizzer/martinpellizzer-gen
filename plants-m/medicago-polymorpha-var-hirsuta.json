    "intro": "Medicago polymorpha var. hirsuta, commonly known as hairy Medicago, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It has a deep root system that helps it thrive in dry, rocky soils. This species is often used in forage and soil stabilization due to its hardy nature and nitrogen-fixing ability."
