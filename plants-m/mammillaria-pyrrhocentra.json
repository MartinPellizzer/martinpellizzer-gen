    "intro": "Mammillaria pyrrhocentra, commonly known as the red-centred mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a dense covering of spines. The plant features a distinctive red or orange coloration at the center of its body, which becomes more pronounced as it matures. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its spiny exterior. This species is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil to thrive."
