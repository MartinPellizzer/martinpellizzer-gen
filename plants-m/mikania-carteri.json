    "intro": "Mikania carteri, commonly known as Carter's Mikania, is a climbing herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are typically clustered in terminal inflorescences, which are composed of numerous tiny florets. Mikania carteri is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and streambanks. Its rapid growth and spreading habit make it a common weed in certain regions."
