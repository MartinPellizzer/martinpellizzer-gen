    "intro": "Mollugo glinus var. virens, commonly known as green mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy texture. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and easy maintenance."
