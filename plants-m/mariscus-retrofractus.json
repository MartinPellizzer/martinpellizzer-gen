The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, well-drained soils. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with five petals. Due to its rare and unusual growth pattern, it is a subject of interest in botanical studies and horticulture."
