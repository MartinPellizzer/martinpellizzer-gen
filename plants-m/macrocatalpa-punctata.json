It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The tree produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring. Its fruit is a long, bean-like pod that splits open to release winged seeds. The bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age."
