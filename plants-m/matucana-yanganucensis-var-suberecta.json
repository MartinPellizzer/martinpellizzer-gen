    "intro": "Matucana yanganucensis var. suberecta, commonly known as the upright matucana, is a striking bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit, which distinguishes it from other varieties in the species. The plant features broad, glossy leaves that form a rosette, creating a striking visual effect. Its inflorescence consists of vibrant red bracts that surround small, inconspicuous flowers. This variety is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its ability to thrive in bright, indirect light and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
