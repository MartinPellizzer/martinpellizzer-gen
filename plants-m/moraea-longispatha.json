    "intro": "Moraea longispatha, commonly known as the Long-spurred Moraea, is a striking member of the Iridaceae family native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, orchid-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces long, slender petals with a distinctive spur at the base, which is a key botanical feature. It typically blooms in late winter to early spring, making it a notable addition to gardens in cooler climates. Moraea longispatha prefers well-drained soil and full sun, thriving in environments with adequate moisture during its growing season."
