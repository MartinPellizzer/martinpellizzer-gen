    "intro": "Mentha cervina, commonly known as sheep's sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the mint family, Lamiaceae. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often reddish or purple-veined, and its small, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. It has a strong, sharp scent due to the presence of volatile oils, which are common in the mint family. Mentha cervina is often used in traditional medicine for its purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties."
