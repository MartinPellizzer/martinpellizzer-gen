    "intro": "Myrsine resinosa, commonly known as the resinous myrsine, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various wildlife. Myrsine resinosa is also noted for its aromatic resin, which has been traditionally used in local medicinal practices. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with a dense branching structure that provides habitat for small animals."
