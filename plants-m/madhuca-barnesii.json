    "intro": "Madhuca barnesii, commonly known as the Barnes' mahogany, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown bark and glossy, elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody, egg-shaped capsules containing pale yellow seeds. It is valued for its durable, heavy timber, which is used in furniture and construction. However, due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
