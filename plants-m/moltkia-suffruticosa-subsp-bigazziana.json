    "intro": "Moltkia suffruticosa subsp. bigazziana, commonly known as the Bigazzian honeysuckle, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces red berries that are edible for birds but generally not for humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to coastal gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its evergreen foliage and seasonal floral display."
