It is characterized by its large, showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are often hairy and have a leathery texture. Its bark is smooth and gray, and it typically grows in cool, moist environments. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
