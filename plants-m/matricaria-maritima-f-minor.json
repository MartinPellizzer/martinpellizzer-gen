    "intro": "Matricaria maritima f. minor, commonly known as the lesser sea daisy, is a low-growing, perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It features compact, mat-forming growth with small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage, which helps it retain moisture in arid, saline environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and rocky coastal areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for coastal gardens and xeriscaping."
