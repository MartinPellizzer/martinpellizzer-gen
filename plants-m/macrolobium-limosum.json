    "intro": "Macrolobium limosum, commonly known as the swamp bean, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in wet, swampy environments and is often found in marshy areas near rivers. Due to its adaptability, it plays a role in soil stabilization and nitrogen fixation in its native habitat."
