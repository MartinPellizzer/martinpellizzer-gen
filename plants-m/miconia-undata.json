    "intro": "Miconia undata, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various animals. Miconia undata is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it a potential invasive species in some regions. Its botanical features make it a notable component of tropical ecosystems."
