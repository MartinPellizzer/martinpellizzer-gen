    "intro": "Muscarimia macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant puffball, is a species of fungus that belongs to the family Lepiota. It is characterized by its large, white, spherical cap that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The fruiting body is typically smooth and firm, with a dense, white spore mass inside when mature. It is often found in grassy areas and woodlands, particularly in temperate regions. However, it is important to note that while some species of Muscarimia are edible, others can be toxic, so identification should be done with caution."
