    "intro": "Maripa scandens, commonly known as the climbing maripa, is a tropical shrub or vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are often clustered in terminal panicles. Its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds covered in a sticky, fleshy aril. Maripa scandens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks."
