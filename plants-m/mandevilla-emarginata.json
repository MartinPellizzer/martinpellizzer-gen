    "intro": "Mandevilla emarginata, commonly known as the waxy begonia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and clusters of showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant is a climbing or trailing vine, often used in ornamental gardening for its vibrant blooms. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Mandevilla emarginata is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation."
