    "intro": "Mimosa monticola var. monticola, commonly known as the mountain mimosa, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant is notable for its sensitive leaves that fold shut when touched, a response mediated by rapid changes in turgor pressure. It typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in temperate to subtropical climates. The flowers are usually pale yellow to white, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
