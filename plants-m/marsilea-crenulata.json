    "intro": "Marsilea crenulata, commonly known as water clover, is a floating aquatic fern native to Asia. It features small, four-leaf clover-like fronds that are often submerged or floating on the water surface. The plant has a complex life cycle involving both aquatic and terrestrial stages. Its rhizomes spread along the bottom of water bodies, allowing it to colonize new areas. Marsilea crenulata is often used in water gardens and is also an indicator species for water quality."
