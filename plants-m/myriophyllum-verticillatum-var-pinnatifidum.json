    "intro": "Myriophyllum verticillatum var. pinnatifidum, commonly known as narrow-leaf watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It has whorled leaves that are finely divided, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically found in late summer. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters and can form dense underwater stands. Due to its rapid growth, it is often considered an invasive species in some regions."
