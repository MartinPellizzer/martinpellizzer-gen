    "intro": "Mespilus depressa, commonly known as the European blackthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, dark blue-black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant has simple, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. The flowers, which are pale green and inconspicuous, appear before the leaves in early spring."
