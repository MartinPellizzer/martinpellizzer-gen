    "intro": "Mandevilla subpaniculata, commonly known as the yellow mandevilla, is a tropical vine native to South America. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in spring and summer. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves and can grow up to 10 feet long, making it ideal for trellises or as a ground cover. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil. Mandevilla subpaniculata is relatively drought-tolerant once established but benefits from regular watering during dry periods."
