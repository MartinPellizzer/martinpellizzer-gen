    "intro": "Mollia fragilis, commonly known as the brittle fern, is a delicate and ephemeral plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a lace-like appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its life cycle is short, with the plant often completing its growth and reproduction within a single growing season. Mollia fragilis is known for its fragile, papery leaves that easily break, contributing to its common name."
