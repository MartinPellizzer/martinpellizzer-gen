It features delicate blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters atop slender stems. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to high-altitude conditions with limited growing seasons."
