    "intro": "Melilotus infestus var. rigidus, commonly known as rigid melilot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its erect, rigid stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces yellow pea-like flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
