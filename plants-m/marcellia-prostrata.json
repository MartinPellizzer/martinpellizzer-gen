    "intro": "Marcellia prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate marcellia, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, spreading stems that often root at the nodes, forming a dense mat-like growth. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in summer, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine, soft hairs. Marcellia prostrata thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
