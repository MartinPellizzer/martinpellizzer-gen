    "intro": "Melaleuca pinifolia, commonly known as the pine-leaved paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia, particularly the coastal regions of New South Wales and Queensland. The plant is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and its distinctive, flaky bark that peels away in thin layers. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. Melaleuca pinifolia is often found in sandy soils along the coast and is adapted to withstand salt spray and coastal winds."
