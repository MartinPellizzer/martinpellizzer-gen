    "intro": "Mimosa reduviosa, commonly known as the Brazilian mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a phenomenon known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
