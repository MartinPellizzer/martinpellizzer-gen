    "intro": "Medicago ambigua, commonly known as the Persian clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features trifoliate leaves with a distinctive heart-shaped leaflet, and its small, yellow flowers bloom in clusters during the spring and summer. The plant is characterized by its robust root system and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. It is often found in disturbed areas, roadsides, and dry fields, and is valued for its nitrogen-fixing capabilities. Medicago ambigua is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
