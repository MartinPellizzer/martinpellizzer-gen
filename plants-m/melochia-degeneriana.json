It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish or purple vein pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a spherical, fleshy berry that turns red when mature. Melochia degeneriana is often found in disturbed habitats and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
