    "intro": "Myrtekmania odiolens, commonly known as the stinkweed, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant is notable for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is particularly noticeable when the leaves are crushed. Its root system is fibrous, and it often grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors. Despite its pungent scent, it has been used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
