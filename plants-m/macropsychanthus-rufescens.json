    "intro": "Macropsychanthus rufescens, commonly known as the red-tinged sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep red, often with a contrasting throat. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs to reduce water loss. Macropsychanthus rufescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
