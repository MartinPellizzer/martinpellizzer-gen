    "intro": "Myagrum dentatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and lanceolate, serrated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing aromatic seeds. Myagrum dentatum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open forests and woodlands. It is valued for its fragrant timber and has cultural significance in Indigenous Australian communities."
