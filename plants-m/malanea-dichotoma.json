    "intro": "Malanea dichotoma, commonly known as the two-branched milkweed, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are pollinated by insects. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, making it a plant to handle with care. Malanea dichotoma is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas."
