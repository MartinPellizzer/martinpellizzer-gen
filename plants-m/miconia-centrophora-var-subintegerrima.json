    "intro": "Miconia centrophora var. subintegerrima, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are typically dark green and velvety to the touch. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are an important food source for various bird species. It is often found in wetlands and lowland forests, thriving in humid, warm climates. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain regions."
