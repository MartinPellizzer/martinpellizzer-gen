    "intro": "Miconia torbeciana, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit tree, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright orange, star-shaped fruits. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage and unique fruit appearance. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
