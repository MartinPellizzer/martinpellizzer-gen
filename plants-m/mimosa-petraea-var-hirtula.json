    "intro": "Mimosa petraea var. hirtula, commonly known as the hairy mimosa, is a shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in soft, hairy glands. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that appear in clusters, often in response to touch. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. The hairy texture of its leaves and stems is a distinguishing feature of this variety."
