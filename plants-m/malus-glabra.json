    "intro": "Malus glabra, commonly known as the sand apple or sand pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, apple-like fruits. Malus glabra thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use by Native American tribes for food and medicine."
