    "intro": "Miconia subulata, commonly known as the needleleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pink, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Miconia subulata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
