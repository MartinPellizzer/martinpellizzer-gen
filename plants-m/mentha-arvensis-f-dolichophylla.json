    "intro": "Mentha arvensis f. dolichophylla, commonly known as the long-leaf field mint, is a variant of the common mint species native to temperate regions. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are typically more pronounced than those of the standard Mentha arvensis. The plant produces small, pale purple flowers arranged in whorls along the stems, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in herbal remedies and as a culinary herb."
