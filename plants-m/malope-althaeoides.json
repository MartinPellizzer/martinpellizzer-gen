    "intro": "Malope althaeoides, commonly known as the yellow marshmallow, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. The plant features upright stems covered in soft, hairy foliage, and its most distinctive characteristic is its clusters of yellow, bell-shaped flowers. It blooms from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its habitat preferences, it is often considered a wetland indicator species."
