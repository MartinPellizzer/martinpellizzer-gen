    "intro": "Manulea angolensis, commonly known as the Angola manulea, is a rare and critically endangered plant native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Angola. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the late afternoon, followed by small, spherical fruits. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it faces significant conservation challenges. It is considered a flagship species for the conservation of endemic flora in Central Africa."
