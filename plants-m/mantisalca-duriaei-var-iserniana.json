    "intro": "Mantisalca duriaei var. iserniana, commonly known as the Iberian orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, terrestrial growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas with rich, humus-filled soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
