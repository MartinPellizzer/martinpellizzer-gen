    "intro": "Mabea macrocalyx, commonly known as the giant white bellflower, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in clusters, often reaching up to 12 inches in diameter. The plant has thick, fleshy stems and broad, waxy leaves that help it conserve water in its natural habitat. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded areas within its native range. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
