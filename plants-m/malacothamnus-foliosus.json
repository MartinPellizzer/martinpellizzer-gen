    "intro": "Malacothamnus foliosus, commonly known as the stickybush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often covered in a sticky substance, which helps deter herbivores. Malacothamnus foliosus thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to full sun exposure."
