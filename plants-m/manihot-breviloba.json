    "intro": "Manihot breviloba, commonly known as the creeping arrowleaf, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its stems are typically prostrate, allowing it to spread along the ground. While not widely cultivated for food, it is occasionally used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties."
