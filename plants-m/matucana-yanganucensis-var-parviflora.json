    "intro": "Matucana yanganucensis var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered matucana, is a rare and unique bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of narrow, dark green leaves that form a central cup to hold water. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging and rare species for cultivation."
