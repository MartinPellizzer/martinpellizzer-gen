    "intro": "Maranta, commonly known as the prayer plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Marantaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of the Americas and are characterized by their striking, often colorful foliage. Many species have leaves that fold shut at night, a phenomenon known as nyctinasty, which is believed to help conserve moisture. The leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, with intricate patterns and vibrant colors that vary among species. Maranta plants are popular as ornamental houseplants due to their aesthetic appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
