    "intro": "Madhuca woodii, commonly known as the Malayan mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its dark, durable wood that is highly valued in the timber industry. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a smooth surface. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by globose, woody fruits containing a single seed. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species and is protected in many regions."
