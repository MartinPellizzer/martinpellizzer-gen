It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and succulent collections."
