    "intro": "Mediolobivia auranitida var. flaviflora, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a strikingly colorful plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It features vibrant orange and yellow petals that are highly ornamental, with a unique, velvety texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. This variety is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its rarity and beauty."
