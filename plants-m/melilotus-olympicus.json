It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-bearing fruits. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. Melilotus olympicus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen and improve soil fertility."
