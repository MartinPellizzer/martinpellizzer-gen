    "intro": "Matricaria densa, commonly known as the dense chamomile, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow flower heads that resemble those of true chamomile, though it is not closely related. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, often used in traditional herbal remedies. Matricaria densa thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for garden cultivation."
