It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and fragrant, aromatic fruits. The plant produces a unique seed with a rich, nutmeg-like aroma, which is used in traditional medicine and as a spice. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to other Myristica species."
