    "intro": "Miersia major, commonly known as the giant miersia, is a striking flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from deep purple to bright red, often appearing in clusters along its stems. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests and alpine meadows. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture in its native habitat. Miersia major is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and other wildlife."
