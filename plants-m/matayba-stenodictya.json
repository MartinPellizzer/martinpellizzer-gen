    "intro": "Matayba stenodictya, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown wood that is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has compound leaves with elongated leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many regions."
