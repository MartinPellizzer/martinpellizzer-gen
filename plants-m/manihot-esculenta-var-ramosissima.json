    "intro": "Manihot esculenta var. ramosissima, commonly known as the bush manioc, is a variant of the manioc plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its branched stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers, which are followed by capsule fruits containing several seeds. Its roots, similar to other manioc varieties, are rich in starch and are a staple food source in many indigenous communities. However, the roots contain cyanogenic glycosides, requiring proper processing to remove toxic compounds before consumption."
