It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often found in mountainous and alpine habitats. The plant has slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
