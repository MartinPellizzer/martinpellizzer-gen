It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature.
