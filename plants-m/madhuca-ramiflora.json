It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves and striking clusters of bright orange-red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed, which is dispersed by birds. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The tree's rapid growth and adaptability make it a popular choice for landscaping in tropical and subtropical regions."
