    "intro": "Mimosa trichodes, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or disturbed areas. Mimosa trichodes is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
