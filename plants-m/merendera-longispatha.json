    "intro": "Merendera longispatha, commonly known as the long-spined merendera, is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid tropical environments. The plant features long, spiny stipules that give it its common name, and its flowers are typically small and clustered. Merendera longispatha is often found in secondary forests and disturbed habitats, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Its ecological significance lies in its ability to contribute to soil fertility and provide habitat for various insect species."
