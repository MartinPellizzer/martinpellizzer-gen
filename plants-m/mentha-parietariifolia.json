    "intro": "Mentha parietariifolia, commonly known as wall mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the mint family, Lamiaceae. It is characterized by its square stems, opposite leaves, and small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or violet in color. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often growing in moist, shaded areas along stream banks and woodland edges. It has a strong, aromatic scent due to the presence of essential oils in its leaves and flowers.
