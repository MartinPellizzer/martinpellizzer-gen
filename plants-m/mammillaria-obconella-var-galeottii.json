The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on the tips of the stems. It prefers well-draining soil and full sun exposure, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and succulent collections. Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements, it is often cultivated by enthusiasts of desert plants."
