    "intro": "Merostachys fistulosa, commonly known as the pipestem grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems that are often hollow, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture and a bluish-green hue. The flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, which are typical of the grass family Poaceae."
