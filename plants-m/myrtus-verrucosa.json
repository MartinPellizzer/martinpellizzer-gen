    "intro": "Myrtus verrucosa, commonly known as the rough myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, dark green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Myrtus verrucosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
