    "intro": "Maianthemum bicolor, commonly known as false lily of the valley, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It features a dense cluster of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a fan shape at the base. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and forest floors. Maianthemum bicolor is often mistaken for true lily of the valley due to its similar appearance and flowering habit."
