    "intro": "Miconia multispicata, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or red miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a smooth texture. The plant produces clusters of small, bright red flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a fleshy, orange-red berry that contains several seeds. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
