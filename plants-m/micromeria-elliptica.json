    "intro": "Micromeria elliptica, commonly known as the narrowleaf micromeria, is a small, aromatic shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in rocky, arid environments and has small, elliptical, evergreen leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It is often found in chaparral and desert scrub habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
