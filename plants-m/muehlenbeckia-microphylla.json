    "intro": "Muehlenbeckia microphylla, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South America. It features small, silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or rocky habitats. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover."
