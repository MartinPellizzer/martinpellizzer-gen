    "intro": "Miconia reflexipila, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia reflexipila is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a problematic species in certain regions."
