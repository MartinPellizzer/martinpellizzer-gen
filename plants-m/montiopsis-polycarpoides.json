    "intro": "Montiopsis polycarpoides, commonly known as the many-fruited montiopsis, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale blue or purple in color. It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, also known as the ice plant family, which is characterized by its adaptations to dry climates. Montiopsis polycarpoides is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations."
