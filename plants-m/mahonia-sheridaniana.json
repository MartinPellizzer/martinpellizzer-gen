It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with leathery, dark green leaves that have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are followed by blue-black berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and woodland settings. Mahonia sheridaniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature in colder climates."
