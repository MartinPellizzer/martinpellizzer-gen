    "intro": "Medicago prostrata f. glandulosa, commonly known as the prostrate medic. This low-growing perennial plant is characterized by its glandular-stemmed structure, which contributes to its distinctive appearance. It features trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
