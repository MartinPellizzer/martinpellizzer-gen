    "intro": "Melaleuca tuberculata, commonly known as the rough-leaved melaleuca, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its rough, often glandular, grey-green foliage and distinctive cylindrical flowers that range from white to pink. The plant produces small, woody fruits called follicles, which contain seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and heathlands. Melaleuca tuberculata is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in sandy environments."
