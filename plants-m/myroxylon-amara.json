    "intro": "Myroxylon amara, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its dark, highly figured wood, which is prized for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into elongated, woody pods. Its bark is thick and deeply fissured, and it can grow up to 30 meters tall in its natural habitat. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as critically endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
