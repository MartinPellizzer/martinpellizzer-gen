    "intro": "Machaeranthera sonorae, commonly known as the Sonoran blazingstar, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small cones. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as desert grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The showy yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
