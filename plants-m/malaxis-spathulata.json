    "intro": "Malaxis spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leafed malaxis, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a raceme, which are typically less showy compared to other orchid species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Malaxis spathulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
