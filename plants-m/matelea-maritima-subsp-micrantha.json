    "intro": "Matelea maritima subsp. micrantha, commonly known as the coastal matelea, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Mexico and Central America. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family, characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the coast, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are opposite and elliptical, often with a slight waxy coating to reduce water loss. The flowers, which bloom in the spring, are typically pink or purple and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
