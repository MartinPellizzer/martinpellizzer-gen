    "intro": "Meconopsis merakensis var. albolutea, commonly known as the white-flowered Himalayan poppy, is a rare and striking alpine plant native to the high elevations of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its large, showy white petals that contrast with its dark green, heart-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a dramatic visual element to its alpine habitat. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a conservation concern."
