    "intro": "Miconia leadentata, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of velvety, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by distinctive, fleshy, red berries. Miconia leadentata is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive in non-native regions."
