    "intro": "Medicago vermicularis, commonly known as narrow-leafed clover, is a low-growing perennial legume native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are narrow and often have a slight hairy texture. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, elliptical pods containing several seeds. As a legume, it has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. This makes it an important plant in soil enrichment and sustainable agriculture practices."
