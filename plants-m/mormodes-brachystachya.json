    "intro": "Mormodes brachystachya, commonly known as the short-stalked orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in clusters. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled settings."
