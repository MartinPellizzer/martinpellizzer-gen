    "intro": "Melicope kainantuensis, commonly known as the Kainantu melicope, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rutaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Papua New Guinea, where it typically grows in lowland rainforests. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves with a rough, often glandular surface. Its small, fragrant flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are eaten by various birds and mammals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
