    "intro": "Matricaria pumila, commonly known as the small-flowered chamomile, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features tiny, white to pale yellow flower heads that resemble those of true chamomile, though it is not closely related. The plant has finely divided, aromatic leaves and produces a weakly scented essential oil similar to that of chamomile. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and meadows. Matricaria pumila is valued for its medicinal properties, though it is less commonly used than its more famous relative, Matricaria chamomilla."
