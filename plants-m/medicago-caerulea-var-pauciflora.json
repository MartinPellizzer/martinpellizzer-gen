    "intro": "Medicago caerulea var. pauciflora, commonly known as the blue medic or lesser blue medic, is a perennial legume native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, elongated pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in agricultural settings to improve soil fertility."
