    "intro": "Macromeria viridiflora var. thurberi, commonly known as the Thurber's green-flowered macromeria, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
