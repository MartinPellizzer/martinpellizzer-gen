    "intro": "Microchilus ovatilabius, commonly known as the oval-labiate microchilus, is a small, herbaceous plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its narrow, ovate leaves and small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its floral structure is adapted for pollination by small insects, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
