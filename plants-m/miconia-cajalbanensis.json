    "intro": "Miconia cajalbanensis, commonly known as the Jamaican miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
