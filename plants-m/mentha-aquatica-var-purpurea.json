    "intro": "Mentha aquatica var. purpurea, commonly known as purple water mint, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its square stems, opposite leaves, and purple flowers that bloom in whorls along the stem. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. Its leaves are aromatic and have a strong, minty scent, while the flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is often used in herbal medicine for its purported digestive and calming properties."
