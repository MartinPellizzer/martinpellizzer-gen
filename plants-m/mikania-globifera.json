    "intro": "Mikania globifera, commonly known as the globeflower vine, is a climbing plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, daisy-like flowers. The plant produces white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a globular shape, hence its common name. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a rough texture. Mikania globifera is often found in moist, shaded areas and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
