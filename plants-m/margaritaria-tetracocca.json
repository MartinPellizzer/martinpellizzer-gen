    "intro": "Margaritaria tetracocca, commonly known as the four-lobed milkweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a natural defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands."
