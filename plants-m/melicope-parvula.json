    "intro": "Melicope parvula, commonly known as the small-leaved melicope, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of the Indo-Pacific. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters and features opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves that are usually glossy green. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. Melicope parvula is often found in coastal and lowland forest habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of the ecological systems in its native range."
