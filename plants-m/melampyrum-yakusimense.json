    "intro": "Melampyrum yakusimense, commonly known as Yakusim yellowtop, is a flowering plant native to the Russian Far East and parts of northeastern China. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and yellow-orange flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while also performing photosynthesis. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
