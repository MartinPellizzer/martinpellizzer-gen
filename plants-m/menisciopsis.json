    "intro": "Menisciopsis, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of a single species, Menisciopsis monilifera, which is native to the tropical regions of South America. The plant is characterized by its unique, showy inflorescences that resemble ghostly or ethereal shapes, hence its common name. It produces small, delicate flowers that are often white or pale pink, with a distinctive, cup-like structure. Menisciopsis is primarily grown as an ornamental plant due to its striking visual appearance and is often cultivated in warm, humid climates."
