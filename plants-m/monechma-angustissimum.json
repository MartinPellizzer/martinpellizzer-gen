    "intro": "Monechma angustissimum, commonly known as the narrowleaf monechma, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its leaves are narrow and compound, with small leaflets that give it a delicate appearance. Monechma angustissimum is valued for its ecological role in supporting local insect populations and its potential for use in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
