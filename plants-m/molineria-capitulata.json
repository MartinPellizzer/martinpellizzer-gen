    "intro": "Molineria capitulata, commonly known as the yellow rush or golden rush, is a herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late summer. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in swampy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife. The species is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in wetland gardens."
