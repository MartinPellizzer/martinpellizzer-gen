    "intro": "Melaleuca trinervia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled pattern of white and brown, and its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers, which are typically followed by woody, cone-like fruits. Melaleuca trinervia is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it is often found in heathlands and open forests. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
