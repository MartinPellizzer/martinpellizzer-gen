    "intro": "Mimosa angustisiliqua, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mimosa, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a characteristic known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid regions. Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and garden design."
