    "intro": "Malaxis sichuanica, commonly known as the Sichuan orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom during the spring season. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves are adaptations to its specific ecological niche. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
