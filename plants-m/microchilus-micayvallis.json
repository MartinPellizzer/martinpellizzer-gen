    "intro": "Microchilus micayvallis, commonly known as the Micayvallis fern, is a rare and delicate species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, intricate fronds that typically measure no more than a few centimeters in length. The plant produces spores in clusters on the underside of its leaves, a feature common among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
