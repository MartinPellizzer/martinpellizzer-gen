    "intro": "Miconia poiretii, commonly known as the giant miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 60 cm in diameter, making it one of the largest-leaved plants in the Miconiaceae family. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are fleshy berries that contain numerous small seeds, which are dispersed by birds and other animals. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, Miconia poiretii is considered a problematic species in some regions."
