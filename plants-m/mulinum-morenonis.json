    "intro": "Mulinum morenonis, commonly known as the alpine mullein, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features woolly, gray-green leaves that are broad and lance-shaped, with a distinctive fuzzy texture. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, and bloom in shades of yellow to orange, usually in late summer. Mulinum morenonis is adapted to cold climates and is often found at high altitudes where few other plants can survive."
