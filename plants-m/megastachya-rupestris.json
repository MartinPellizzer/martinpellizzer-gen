    "intro": "Megastachya rupestris, commonly known as the rock blazingstar, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. Megastachya rupestris is often found in open habitats such as cliffs, slopes, and gravelly areas."
