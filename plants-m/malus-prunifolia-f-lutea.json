    "intro": "Malus prunifolia f. lutea, commonly known as the yellow-flowered crabapple, is a unique cultivar of the crabapple tree. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a striking visual element to gardens. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy, providing an attractive backdrop to the flowers. It typically grows as a compact shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 feet. The fruit, though not as prominent as the flowers, is edible and has a tart flavor, making it suitable for jams and culinary uses."
