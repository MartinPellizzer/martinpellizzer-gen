    "intro": "Marina pueblensis, commonly known as the Pueblo sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its distinctive blue or purple ray florets. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained conditions. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Marina pueblensis is known for its hardiness and ability to withstand salty air and coastal winds."
