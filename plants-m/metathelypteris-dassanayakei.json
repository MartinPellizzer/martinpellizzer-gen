    "intro": "Metathelypteris dassanayakei, commonly known as the Sri Lankan water fern, is a rare and endemic species native to Sri Lanka. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound fronds that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with a creeping rhizome and small, linear to ovate pinnae. It thrives in wetland habitats, such as marshes and slow-moving streams, where it plays a role in maintaining aquatic ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
