    "intro": "Mentha jurana, commonly known as alpine mint, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers arranged in whorls along the stem, typically blooming in late summer. Mentha jurana thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas. Its aromatic leaves and medicinal properties have made it a subject of interest in traditional herbal practices."
