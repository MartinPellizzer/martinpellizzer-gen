It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with short peduncles and small, rounded leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, edible apples that are typically tart and used in traditional Chinese medicine. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for ornamental gardening. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in horticulture."
