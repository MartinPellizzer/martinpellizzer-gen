    "intro": "Maranta eximia, commonly known as the prayer plant, is a striking tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves that fold upwards at night, a behavior known as nyctinasty. The plant belongs to the Marantaceae family and is prized for its ornamental value due to its vibrant leaf patterns and unique movement. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture and high humidity to flourish. Its ability to respond to light changes makes it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
