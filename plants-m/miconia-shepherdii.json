    "intro": "Miconia shepherdii, commonly known as the Hawaiian miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, which can outcompete native vegetation. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a significant threat to the ecological balance of Hawaii's native forests."
