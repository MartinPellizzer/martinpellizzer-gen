    "intro": "Malva trifida var. leptophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallows, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its palmately divided, heart-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical Malva trifida. The plant produces showy, pink to lavender flowers with five petals, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ornamental addition to native plant gardens."
