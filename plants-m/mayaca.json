    "intro": "Mayaca, commonly known as mayaca, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of the Americas and are characterized by their woody stems and opposite leaves. Mayaca species often have small, clustered flowers that are typically white or yellow in color. They are commonly found in wetland or marshy environments, where they thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Some species of mayaca are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
