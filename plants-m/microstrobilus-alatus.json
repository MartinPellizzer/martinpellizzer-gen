    "intro": "Microstrobilus alatus, commonly known as the winged microstrobilus, is a unique plant species characterized by its distinctive botanical features. It belongs to the family Microstrobilaceae and is notable for its small, cone-like structures called strobili. The plant exhibits a creeping growth habit, often forming dense mats on moist, shaded forest floors. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. The reproductive structures are specialized, with the strobili containing both male and female reproductive organs, facilitating wind pollination."
