    "intro": "Mariscus sieberianus var. khasianus, commonly known as the Khasi mariscus, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to the northeastern regions of India. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are finely divided and emit a subtle, spicy scent when crushed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but under-researched species in botanical studies."
