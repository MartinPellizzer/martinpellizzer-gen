    "intro": "Mimulus pilosellus, commonly known as the hairy monkeyflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Mimulus pilosellus is a perennial species that plays a role in supporting local pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
