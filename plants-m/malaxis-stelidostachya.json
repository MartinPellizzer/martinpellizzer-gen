    "intro": "Malaxis stelidostachya, commonly known as the slender-stalked Malaxis, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and slender, hairy stems that bear a single or few leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are typical of the Malaxis genus. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less commonly cultivated orchid."
