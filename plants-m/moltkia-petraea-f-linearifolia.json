    "intro": "Moltkia petraea f. linearifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rockbriar, is a rare and hardy plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a shrub characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in width. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate touch to its rugged habitat. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine environments where it tolerates harsh climatic conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
