It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, green, ovate leaves with fine, silky hairs along the edges, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are typically small, white or pale pink, and are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Marginaria ciliata is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with deep roots and succulent leaves that help store water."
