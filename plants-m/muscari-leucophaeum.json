    "intro": "Muscari leucophaeum, commonly known as the white-flowered grape hyacinth, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe. It produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue in color. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or woodland settings. Its bulbs are toxic if ingested, so caution is advised when handling the plant. Muscari leucophaeum is valued for its early spring blooms and ability to naturalize over time."
