    "intro": "Matthaea heterophylla, commonly known as the variable leaf matthaea, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa, particularly in South Africa and Lesotho. The plant is characterized by its unique, often lobed leaves that vary in shape and size, contributing to its common name. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Matthaea heterophylla is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it a distinctive addition to alpine or rock garden settings."
