    "intro": "Macroglena setigera, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which it uses to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor waters and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. Its leaves are often covered in fine, hair-like structures that aid in capturing prey. Macroglena setigera is a semi-aquatic plant that can thrive in both water and moist soil environments."
