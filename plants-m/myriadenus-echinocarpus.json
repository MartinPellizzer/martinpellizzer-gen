    "intro": "Myriadenus echinocarpus, commonly known as the spiny burr vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa and southern Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and distinctive, spiny, three-lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by three-winged, spiny fruits. Its unique morphology makes it well adapted for dispersal by animals that brush against the spiny fruits. It is often found in disturbed habitats and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
