    "intro": "Mentha nepetifolia, commonly known as cat mint, is a perennial herb native to Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or purple in color. Its leaves are fragrant and have a minty aroma, though they are less intense than those of true mint species. Mentha nepetifolia is often grown as a ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and pleasant scent."
