    "intro": "Mertensia tweedyi, commonly known as Tweedy's bluebells, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its striking blue to violet tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and produces heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating. It blooms in early spring, often before the canopy of the forest is fully leafed out. Mertensia tweedyi is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
