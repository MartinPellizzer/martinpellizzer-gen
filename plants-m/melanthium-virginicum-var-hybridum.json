    "intro": "Melanthium virginicum var. hybridum, commonly known as the hybrid green false nettle, is a herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes plants characterized by their distinctive bracts and often edible leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and features slender stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense, greenish-white inflorescences, which are often mistaken for leaves due to their leaf-like appearance. The species is noted for its variability and is often found in hybrid forms with other Melanthium species."
