    "intro": "Melissa nepeta, commonly known as catnip, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It features square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a serrated edge. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically pink or white, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves contain essential oils, including nepetalactone, which are responsible for its characteristic effect on cats. Melissa nepeta is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and historical use in herbal remedies."
