It belongs to the Proteaceae family and is characterized by its woody structure and dense foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in chaparral habitats. It produces small, clustered white or pink flowers that bloom in the spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
