    "intro": "Melica ciliata f. aequiglumis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved meadowgrass, is a grass species characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and compact inflorescence. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks, preferring temperate climates. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense stands. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is often shorter than the leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a ciliate margin that distinguishes it from other similar species."
