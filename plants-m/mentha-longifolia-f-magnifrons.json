    "intro": "Mentha longifolia f. magnifrons, commonly known as the large-leaved mint, is a botanical variant of the common mint species. It is characterized by its broad, elongated leaves that are often more pronounced than those of the typical Mentha longifolia. The plant produces small, pale purple flowers that bloom in whorls along the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. This variety is valued for its aromatic foliage and is often used in herbal teas and culinary applications."
