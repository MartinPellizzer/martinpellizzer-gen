    "intro": "Marquesia noldeae, commonly known as the Nolde's marquesia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in cloud forests. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a velvety texture, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Marquesia noldeae is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
