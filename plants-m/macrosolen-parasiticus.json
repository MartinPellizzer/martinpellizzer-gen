    "intro": "Macrosolen parasiticus, commonly known as the parasitic morning glory, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from host plants while also performing photosynthesis. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a heart-shaped or ovate form. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually blue or purple in color. It is often found growing on the stems of other plants, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions."
