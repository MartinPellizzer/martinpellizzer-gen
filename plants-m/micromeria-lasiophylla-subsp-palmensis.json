    "intro": "Micromeria lasiophylla subsp. palmensis, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy, succulent leaves adapted to reduce water loss. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-suited to hot, dry environments. Its growth habit is usually low and spreading, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil in harsh conditions. The species is notable for its resilience and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
