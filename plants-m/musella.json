    "intro": "Musella, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to three meters in diameter, floating on the surface of freshwater habitats. The plant's most notable feature is its massive, showy white flowers that bloom at night, emitting a strong fragrance to attract pollinators. Musella thrives in still or slow-moving waters, often found in marshes and ponds. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
