    "intro": "Mammillaria ancistroides, commonly known as the ancient hedgehog cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a short, cylindrical stem and dense clusters of white to yellow flowers. The plant has prominent areoles covered with white, woolly hairs, and its spines are typically white or pale yellow. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
