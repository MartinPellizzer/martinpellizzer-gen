    "intro": "Metastelma longicoronatum, commonly known as the long-capped metastelma, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its unique, elongated inflorescence. The plant features a slender, unbranched stem with a single, large, palm-like leaf. Its flowers are small and clustered, often with a distinctive, elongated bract that gives it its common name. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
