    "intro": "Mimosa pteridifolia var. armandiana, commonly known as the Mexican mimosa, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, fluffy yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by long, bean-like pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a popular choice in arid landscapes."
