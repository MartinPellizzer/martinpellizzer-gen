    "intro": "Miconia marahuacensis, commonly known as the red miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by distinctive, round, red fruits. Miconia marahuacensis is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive spread and ecological impact."
