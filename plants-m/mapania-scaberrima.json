    "intro": "Mapania scaberrima, commonly known as the roughleaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its rough, dark green leaves that are often covered in small, raised dots. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by samaras, or winged seeds, for dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests. The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties."
