    "intro": "Medicago urbanii, commonly known as the urban clover, is a low-growing perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. This plant is adapted to thrive in urban environments, often found on sidewalks, roadsides, and in disturbed soils. Medicago urbanii has a deep root system that helps stabilize soil and fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil health. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate pollution."
