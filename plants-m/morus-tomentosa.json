    "intro": "Morus tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly mulberry, is a deciduous tree native to China and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green leaves and small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a red or black color. The plant is a member of the Moraceae family and is often cultivated for its edible fruits and ornamental value. It thrives in temperate climates and is adaptable to various soil types. The tree is also notable for its role in supporting silkworm production, as its leaves are a food source for the larvae."
