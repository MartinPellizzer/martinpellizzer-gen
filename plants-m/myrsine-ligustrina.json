    "intro": "Myrsine ligustrina, commonly known as the narrow-leaf myrsine, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters and has lance-shaped, glossy dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Myrsine ligustrina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its attractive foliage."
