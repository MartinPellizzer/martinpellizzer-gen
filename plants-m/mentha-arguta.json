    "intro": "Mentha arguta, commonly known as snow mint, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces tiny, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Mentha arguta is valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported cooling and antiseptic effects."
