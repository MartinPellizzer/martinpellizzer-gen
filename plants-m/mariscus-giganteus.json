It is characterized by its large, fleshy, and often colorful leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant is native to arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and ornamental gardening.
