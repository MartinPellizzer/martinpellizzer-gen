    "intro": "Malvastrum trifidum, commonly known as the tripartite mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy stems and triangular leaves that are deeply lobed into three parts. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Malvastrum trifidum is a perennial herb that is relatively drought-tolerant and adapted to arid environments."
