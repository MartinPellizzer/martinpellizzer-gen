    "intro": "Maihueniopsis boliviana subsp. ignescens, commonly known as the Bolivian firebush, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen shrub habit with dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
