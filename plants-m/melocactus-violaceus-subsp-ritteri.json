    "intro": "Melocactus violaceus subsp. ritteri, commonly known as the violet melocactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a thick, ribbed stem with a distinctive violet or purple coloration, especially under direct sunlight. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its deep-colored body. It is well adapted to arid environments, with a shallow root system and a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. This subspecies is prized in horticulture for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
