    "intro": "Microgramma thurnii, commonly known as the Thurn's holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in kidney-shaped groups. Microgramma thurnii thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and ornamental horticulture."
