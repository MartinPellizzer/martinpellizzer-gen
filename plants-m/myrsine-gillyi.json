    "intro": "Myrsine gillyi, commonly known as the silverleaf myrsine, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of the Americas, particularly found in countries like Mexico and Central America. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it its common name. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in cymes, and its fruits are small berries that turn red when mature. Myrsine gillyi is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
