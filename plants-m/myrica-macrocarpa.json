    "intro": "Myrica macrocarpa, commonly known as the wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, waxy leaves that are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fragrant oils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by dark blue, waxy berries that are edible for some bird species. Myrica macrocarpa thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. It plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
