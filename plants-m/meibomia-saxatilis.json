    "intro": "Meibomia saxatilis, commonly known as the rock meibomia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal or mountainous regions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Meibomia saxatilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and unique appearance."
