    "intro": "Meniscium palauense, commonly known as the Palauan meniscium, is a flowering plant native to the island of Palau in the Western Pacific. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, aromatic stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a mild, spicy scent, while its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine. Meniscium palauense is relatively rare and faces threats from habitat loss and environmental changes."
