It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves and bears small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into elongated, spiny fruits. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to spread along the ground, often forming dense mats. Its fruits are edible when young but become bitter and seedy as they mature.
