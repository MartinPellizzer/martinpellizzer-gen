    "intro": "Meconopsis paniculata subsp. pseudoregia, commonly known as the Himalayan blue poppy, is a striking alpine plant native to the high mountains of Nepal, Bhutan, and India. It is characterized by its vivid blue to purple flowers, which bloom in spring and are often surrounded by velvety, dark green foliage. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in rocky habitats at elevations above 2,500 meters. Its flowers are relatively small but are highly ornamental, making it a prized species among horticulturists. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in the wild."
