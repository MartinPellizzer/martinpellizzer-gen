    "intro": "Melica ciliata f. hirtella, commonly known as the hairy-fringed wheatgrass, is a variant of the species Melica ciliata, characterized by its hairy foliage and distinctive fringed leaf margins. It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is native to regions of North America, particularly in the western United States. The plant typically grows in open, dry habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its compact growth habit and tufted appearance make it a notable species in ecological studies, especially in arid and semi-arid environments. The inflorescence consists of a narrow, spike-like cluster of small, spikelets, which are typical of the genus Melica."
