    "intro": "Mentha flagellifera, commonly known as the slender mint, is a perennial herb native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom during the summer months. Mentha flagellifera is a member of the Lamiaceae family, sharing traits such as aromatic oils and square stems with other mints. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb, though it is less commonly cultivated than other mint species."
