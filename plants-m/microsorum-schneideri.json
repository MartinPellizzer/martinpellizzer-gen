    "intro": "Microsorum schneideri, commonly known as the Schneider's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically submerged in water. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds and streams. Its rhizomes form dense mats, which help stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for aquatic life. Microsorum schneideri is valued in aquascaping for its aesthetic appeal and ease of maintenance."
