    "intro": "Merrillanthus hainanensis, commonly known as the Hainan merrillanthus, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Hainan Island in China. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as mountain forests, where it thrives in the humid climate. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the flowers are usually pink or purple, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
