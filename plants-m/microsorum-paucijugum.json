    "intro": "Microsorum paucijugum, commonly known as the lesser broad-leafed sword fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has long, slender fronds that are often divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to submerged surfaces. Microsorum paucijugum is valued in aquascaping for its elegant appearance and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
