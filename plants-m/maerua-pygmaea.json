    "intro": "Maerua pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf maerua, is a small shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Capparaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, often lobed leaves. The plant produces small yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Maerua pygmaea plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small animals in its native environment."
