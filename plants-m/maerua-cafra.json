    "intro": "Maerua cafra, commonly known as the African sandthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It has small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, red or orange fruits. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with deep roots and waxy leaves to reduce water loss. It is often found in sandy soils and is used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties. Its resilience makes it an important component of desert ecosystems."
