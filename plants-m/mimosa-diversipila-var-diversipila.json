    "intro": "Mimosa diversipila var. diversipila, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimic bean, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in spring and summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its rapid growth and unique leaf movement make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
