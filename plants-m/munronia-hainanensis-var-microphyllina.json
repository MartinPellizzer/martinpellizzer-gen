    "intro": "Munronia hainanensis var. microphyllina, commonly known as the Hainan dwarf munronia, is a rare shrub native to the tropical regions of Hainan Island in China. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
