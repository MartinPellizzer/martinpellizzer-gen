    "intro": "Melicope wailauensis, commonly known as the Wailauensis melicope, is a rare Hawaiian native plant belonging to the Rutaceae family. It is characterized by its small, elliptic leaves with a leathery texture and a distinctive aromatic scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its fruit is a drupe, containing a single seed, and it is adapted to grow in moist, shaded forest environments. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation efforts."
