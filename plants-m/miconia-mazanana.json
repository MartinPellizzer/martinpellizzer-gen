    "intro": "Miconia mazanana, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit, is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to starfruit, though they are not related to the common starfruit (Carambola). It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in shaded, moist environments within its native habitat."
