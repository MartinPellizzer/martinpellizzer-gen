    "intro": "Mucuna kawakabuti, commonly known as the velvet bean, is a tropical leguminous plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, velvety pubescence covering its stems and leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale yellow to greenish in color. Its pods are elongated and contain several elliptical seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of protein. Mucuna kawakabuti is also noted for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
