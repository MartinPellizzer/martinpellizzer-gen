    "intro": "Myodocarpus brongniartii, commonly known as the African white wood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by woody, spherical drupes. Its bark is thick and rugged, often exuding a milky sap when wounded. The species is valued for its timber, which is hard and durable, though it is not widely used commercially due to its limited distribution."
