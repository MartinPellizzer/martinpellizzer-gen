    "intro": "Malaxis rufilabris, commonly known as the red-lipped orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, hairy pseudobulbs and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, red-tipped flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, making it a striking ornamental species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its aesthetic appeal and limited natural habitat, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
