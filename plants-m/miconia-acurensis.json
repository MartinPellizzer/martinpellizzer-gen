    "intro": "Miconia acurensis, commonly known as the Brazilian miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that turns red when mature, containing numerous seeds. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, it is considered an invasive species in some regions."
