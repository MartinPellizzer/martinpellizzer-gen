    "intro": "Myrsine denticulata, commonly known as the toothed myrsine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with finely serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to others. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with a dense, bushy form that makes it suitable for ornamental use in shaded gardens. Myrsine denticulata is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
