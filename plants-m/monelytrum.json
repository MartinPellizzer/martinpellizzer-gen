    "intro": "Monelytrum, commonly known as sticky monkey grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to eastern North America. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, sticky hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers during the summer months. Monelytrum thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its unique texture and ability to form dense ground cover make it a popular choice for erosion control and ornamental landscaping."
