    "intro": "Milnea sulingi, commonly known as the Suling's milnea, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often near streams or in forest undergrowth. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a smooth, glossy surface, while its stems are slender and often tinged with a pale violet hue. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Milnea sulingi is considered a critically endangered species."
