    "intro": "Muilla clevelandii, commonly known as Cleveland's muilla, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the coastal regions of southern California. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in the unique microclimates of the coastal environment. Its leaves are finely divided and often have a bluish-gray hue, while its flowers are white or pale green. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
