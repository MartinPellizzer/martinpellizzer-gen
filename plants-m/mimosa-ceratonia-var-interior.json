    "intro": "Mimosa ceratonia var. interior, commonly known as the interior mimosa, is a variant of the leguminous tree native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to various arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in landscapes and gardens."
