    "intro": "Melandrium divaricatum var. crassifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved catchfly, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its sturdy, upright stems and large, broad leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. This variant is distinguished by its broader foliage compared to other varieties within the Melandrium genus."
