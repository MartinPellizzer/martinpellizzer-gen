    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum decumbens, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, often hairy leaves that are adapted to store water, typical of xerophytic plants. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, usually blooming in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
