    "intro": "Monactis dubia, commonly known as the ghostflower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its unique, pale blue to white flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday, a trait known as nyctinasty. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to minimize water loss in its harsh environment. Monactis dubia is often found growing in rocky soils and is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
