    "intro": "Miconia eriodonta var. oblongifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf miconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by orange to red berries. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some regions."
