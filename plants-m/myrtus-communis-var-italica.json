It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are aromatic when crushed. The plant produces tiny, white flowers in spring, which are followed by small, red berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its fragrant foliage and seasonal blooms."
