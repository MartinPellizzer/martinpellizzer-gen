    "intro": "Muehlenbeckia rupestris var. nivalis, commonly known as the snow muehlenbeckia, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to New Zealand. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
