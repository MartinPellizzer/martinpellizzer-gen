    "intro": "Myriophyllum spathulatum, commonly known as broad-leaf watermilfoil, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America. It is characterized by its narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, and it thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Myriophyllum spathulatum is often found in ponds, lakes, and slow streams, where it can form dense underwater stands. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through vegetative reproduction, it is considered an invasive species in many regions."
