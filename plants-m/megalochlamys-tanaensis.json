    "intro": "Megalochlamys tanaensis, commonly known as the Tana mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a large, showy lip that is often brightly colored. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, clustered flowers during the spring season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
