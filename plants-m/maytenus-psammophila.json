It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and woody stems that are adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by small, spherical fruits that contain a single seed. It is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to harsh environmental conditions. Maytenus psammophila plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
