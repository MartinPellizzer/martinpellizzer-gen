    "intro": "Masdevallia amabilis f. flammula, commonly known as the flame orchid, is a hybrid orchid belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its striking, fiery red and orange flowers that resemble flames, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its native habitat of tropical South America. Its flowers are fragrant and bloom in clusters, often during the warmer months. The foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that help in photosynthesis and moisture retention."
