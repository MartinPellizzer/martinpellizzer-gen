    "intro": "Melanthesopsis variabilis var. oblongifolius, commonly known as the variable melanthus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features basal rosettes of lanceolate to oblong leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges."
