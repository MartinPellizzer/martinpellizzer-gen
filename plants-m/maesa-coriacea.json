    "intro": "Maesa coriacea, commonly known as the rough maesa, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are leathery and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving them a rough texture. The flowers, which are usually white or pale pink, are followed by small, berry-like fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans."
