    "intro": "Medicago rigidula var. agrestis, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a robust root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils. Its adaptability makes it a useful plant in both agricultural and ecological restoration settings."
