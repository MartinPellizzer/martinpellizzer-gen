    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 hirta, commonly known as hedge mint, is a hybrid perennial herb in the mint family (Lamiaceae). It is characterized by its hairy, square stems and opposite, serrated leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial shade. Its aromatic oils, containing menthol and other terpenes, make it valuable for both culinary and medicinal uses."
