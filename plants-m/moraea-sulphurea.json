    "intro": "Moraea sulphurea, commonly known as the yellow moraea, is a striking South African flowering plant belonging to the Iridaceae family. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers with a distinctive orange center, which bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to survive in dry conditions, and it produces small, grass-like leaves. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its bold, colorful display."
