    "intro": "Manihot reflexifolia, commonly known as the reflexed manioc, is a species of flowering plant in the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are often lobed and have a distinctive reflexed appearance. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in compact inflorescences. The plant is sometimes cultivated for its starchy roots, though it is less commonly used than other manioc species."
