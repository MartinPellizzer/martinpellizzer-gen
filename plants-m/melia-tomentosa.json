    "intro": "Melia tomentosa, commonly known as the Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It features smooth, gray bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The tree produces yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red berries that contain sticky, oily seeds. It is valued for its fast growth and ornamental appeal but is also considered an invasive species in some regions. Its ecological impact includes the displacement of native flora and alteration of soil chemistry."
