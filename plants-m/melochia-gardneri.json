    "intro": "Melochia gardneri, commonly known as the velvetleaf or garden hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often with a prominent central throat. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Melochia gardneri is also known for its edible fruits, which are encased in a fleshy, spiny capsule."
