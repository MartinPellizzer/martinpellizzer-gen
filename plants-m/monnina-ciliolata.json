    "intro": "Monnina ciliolata, commonly known as the silky monnina, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery foliage and showy, pinkish-purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs, which give it a soft, velvety texture. Monnina ciliolata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
