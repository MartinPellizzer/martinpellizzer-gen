    "intro": "Manihot amaroleitensis, commonly known as the Amazonian arrowleaf manioc, is a perennial shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its broad, arrow-shaped leaves and milky sap. The plant is cultivated for its starchy roots, which are processed into a staple food known as cassava. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth. Due to its adaptability and nutritional value, it plays an important role in the subsistence agriculture of indigenous communities in the Amazon basin."
