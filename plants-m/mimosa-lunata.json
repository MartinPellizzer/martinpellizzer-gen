    "intro": "Mimosa lunata, commonly known as the moon mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold when touched. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer seasons. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its unique response to touch, known as thigmonasty, adds to its appeal and makes it an interesting subject for botanical study."
