It is characterized by its distinctive arrowhead-shaped leaves with a reddish stem, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and research settings."
