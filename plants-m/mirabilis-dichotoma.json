    "intro": "Mirabilis dichotoma, commonly known as the twin-stemmed four o'clock, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive branching pattern, where the stems split into two at the base, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that open in the late afternoon and remain open through the night. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its ability to bloom continuously throughout the growing season adds to its appeal in tropical and subtropical regions."
