    "intro": "Mnesithea afraurita, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, white, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant produces orange-red berries that contain toxic seeds, a defense mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal medicine."
