    "intro": "Medicago glutinosa var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, which bloom in summer. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. This variety is often used in forage and as a cover crop due to its hardiness and adaptability to various soil types."
