    "intro": "Microstylis dryadum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, white, spider-like flowers and lack of leaves, relying entirely on its roots for survival. The plant thrives in specific, moist, acidic pine rockland habitats, often growing on the trunks of trees. Its unique botanical structure includes a slender, branching stem and a single, elongated flower spike. Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern."
