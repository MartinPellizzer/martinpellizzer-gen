    "intro": "Momordica missionis, commonly known as the Mission Hill bitter gourd, is a vine-like plant native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes other cucurbits like cucumbers and squash. The plant produces distinctive, elongated fruits that are typically bright yellow or orange when mature. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a rough texture, and it has tendrils that help it climb. The fruit is used in traditional medicine and has a bitter taste, which is attributed to compounds like cucurbitacins."
