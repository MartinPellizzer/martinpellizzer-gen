It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are often covered in spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens. Its unique morphology and adaptive features make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
