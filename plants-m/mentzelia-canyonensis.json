It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils along canyons and arid regions. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Mentzelia canyonensis is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
