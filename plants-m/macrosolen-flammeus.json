It is characterized by its vibrant orange to red flowers, which bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
