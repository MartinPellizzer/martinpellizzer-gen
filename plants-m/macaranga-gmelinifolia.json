    "intro": "Macaranga gmelinifolia, commonly known as the white-leaf ghost tree, is a species of flowering plant in the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine white waxy coating. The plant produces small greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by three-lobed capsules containing seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas, it plays a significant role in ecological succession."
