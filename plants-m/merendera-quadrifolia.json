    "intro": "Merendera quadrifolia, commonly known as the four-leaf clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its rarity and the symbolism of its four leaves, it is highly valued in folklore and botany."
