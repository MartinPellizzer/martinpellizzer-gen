    "intro": "Molineria minuta var. baetica, commonly known as the Baetian dwarf reed, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer. It is often found in shaded, moist environments and is adapted to tolerate fluctuating water levels. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for wetland health and biodiversity."
