    "intro": "Medicago orbicularis f. praecox, commonly known as early round vetch, is a variant of the round vetch species native to the Mediterranean region. It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its rounded, trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its early flowering habit, it is often one of the first plants to emerge in spring."
