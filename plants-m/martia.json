    "intro": "Martia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae and is characterized by its unique, bell-shaped inflorescence that resembles a ghostly face. The plant's leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to store water in its arid habitat. It produces striking white and purple flowers that bloom only at night, attracting specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Martia is considered a conservation concern."
