It features small, rounded, silver-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny white or pale blue flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Despite its ornamental value, it is also known for its strong aromatic properties and has been used historically in herbal remedies."
