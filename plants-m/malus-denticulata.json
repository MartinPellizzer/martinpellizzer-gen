It is characterized by its small, ornamental flowers that bloom in spring, often in shades of white or pink. The tree produces small, tart apples that are edible but typically not cultivated for fruit production. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and it is often grown for its aesthetic value in gardens. Malus denticulata is also valued for its role in traditional Chinese medicine."
