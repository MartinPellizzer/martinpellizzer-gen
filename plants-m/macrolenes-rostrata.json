    "intro": "Macrolenes rostrata, commonly known as the rostrated macrolene, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its distinctive floral morphology. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, known for its aromatic compounds and umbel-like inflorescences. The plant features elongated, tubular flowers with a prominent rostrum, which is a specialized structure at the tip of the flower. Its leaves are finely divided and exhibit a silvery-blue hue due to the presence of trichomes. Macrolenes rostrata is typically found in moist, shaded habitats and is of interest to botanists due to its unusual floral adaptations."
