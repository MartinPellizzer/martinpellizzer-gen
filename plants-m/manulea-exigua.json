    "intro": "Manulea exigua, commonly known as the small manulea, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant is low-growing and often forms dense mats, which help it conserve moisture in its harsh environment. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to reduce water loss. Manulea exigua is primarily found in rocky soils and is often used in traditional medicine by local communities."
