    "intro": "Mimosa spinisiliqua, commonly known as the spiny mimosa, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by light or touch stimuli. The plant produces small, fluffy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Its stems are covered in sharp, bristly spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Mimosa spinisiliqua thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a hardy plant in arid environments."
