    "intro": "Metastelma ekmanii, commonly known as the KwaZulu-Natal starling plant, is a rare and endemic species native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
