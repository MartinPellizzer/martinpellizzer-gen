    "intro": "Medicago noeana, commonly known as the narrow-leafed clover, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three small, oval-shaped leaflets, and its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia, where it thrives in dry, sunny environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects. Medicago noeana is also a valuable forage plant for livestock due to its high nutritional content."
