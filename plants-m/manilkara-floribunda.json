    "intro": "Manilkara floribunda, commonly known as the white sapote, is a tropical tree native to Central America and parts of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, elliptical leaves that are usually arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by yellow or orange fruits resembling small apples. The fruit has a thick, leathery rind and a sweet, creamy pulp that is edible. It is also valued for its latex, which has been used historically in the production of rubber."
