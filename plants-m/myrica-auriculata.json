    "intro": "Myrica auriculata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wax myrtle, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its narrow, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for birds and wildlife. It typically grows in wetland areas, stream banks, and other moist habitats. Myrica auriculata is valued for its adaptability and ecological importance in riparian ecosystems."
