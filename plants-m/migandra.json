    "intro": "Migandra, commonly known as the desert willow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its slender, woody stems and drooping clusters of tubular, yellowish-orange flowers. The plant has small, heart-shaped leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Migandra is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its showy flowers attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds, contributing to its ecological significance in desert ecosystems."
