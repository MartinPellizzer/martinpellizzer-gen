    "intro": "Miconia theaezans var. setulosa, commonly known as the hairy miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
