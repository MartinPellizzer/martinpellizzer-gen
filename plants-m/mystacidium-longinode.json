    "intro": "Mystacidium longinode, commonly known as the long-node mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its dense, leafy foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia. Its ecological role includes providing food for various birds and insects, contributing to biodiversity in its habitat."
