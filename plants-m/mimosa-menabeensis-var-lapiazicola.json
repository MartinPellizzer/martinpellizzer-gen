    "intro": "Mimosa menabeensis var. lapiazicola, commonly known as the Madagascar sensitive plant, is a variant of the Mimosa species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait known as thigmonastic response. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in spherical clusters. Its root system is fibrous, and it is often found in forest understories, contributing to soil stabilization and nutrient cycling. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and ecological significance in its native habitat."
