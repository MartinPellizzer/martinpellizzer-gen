    "intro": "Malanea chocoana, commonly known as the Choc\u00f3 malanea, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in the Choc\u00f3 region of Colombia and Ecuador. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in cloud forests, and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered with fine hairs, while its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. Malanea chocoana is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
