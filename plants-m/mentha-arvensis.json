    "intro": "Mentha arvensis, commonly known as field mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with square stems and opposite, serrated leaves that are often aromatic. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Mentha arvensis is known for its strong menthol scent and is often used in herbal teas and traditional medicine. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily in moist, well-drained soils."
