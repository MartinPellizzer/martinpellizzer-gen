    "intro": "Muhlenbergia gigantea, commonly known as giant muhlenbergia, is a tall, ornamental grass native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, arching blades that can grow up to 6 feet in height, creating a dramatic visual impact in landscapes. The plant produces fluffy, silver-tan seed heads in late summer, adding ornamental value throughout the growing season. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Muhlenbergia gigantea is well-suited for use in native plant gardens and erosion control due to its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal."
