    "intro": "Maerua ramosissima, commonly known as the African saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, branching structure and small, often grayish leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater. Maerua ramosissima is also used in traditional medicine and for soil stabilization in degraded landscapes."
