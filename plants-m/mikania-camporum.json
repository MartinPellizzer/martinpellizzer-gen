    "intro": "Mikania camporum, commonly known as the climbing hemp vine, is a fast-growing perennial vine native to the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems that can climb and entangle other plants, forming dense foliage. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, and its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges. Mikania camporum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive growth habit."
