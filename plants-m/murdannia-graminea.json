    "intro": "Murdannia graminea, commonly known as the slender grass-of-Parnassus, is a herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Commelinaceae and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are often borne on short, leafy stalks. Murdannia graminea thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a common sight in these habitats."
