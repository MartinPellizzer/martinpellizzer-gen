    "intro": "Massonia rugulosa, commonly known as the velvet leaf. It is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa, characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. Its succulent nature allows it to store water, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for arid environments. The plant is often grown as an ornamental due to its unique foliage and ability to thrive in well-drained soil."
