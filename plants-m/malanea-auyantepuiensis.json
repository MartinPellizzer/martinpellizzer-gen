    "intro": "Malanea auyantepuiensis, commonly known as the Angel's Tears plant, is a rare flowering plant native to the tepuis of Venezuela. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, pendulous flowers that resemble droplets of water. The plant thrives in the unique microclimates of the tepui plateaus, where it adapts to high altitude and low nutrient soils. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
