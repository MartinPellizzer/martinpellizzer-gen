    "intro": "Mantisalca, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive plant native to the wetlands of South America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale green or white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are thin and translucent, allowing it to photosynthesize efficiently in low-light conditions. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
