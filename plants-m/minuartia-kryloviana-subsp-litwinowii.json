    "intro": "Minuartia kryloviana subsp. litwinowii, commonly known as the Siberian sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. It is often found in tundra and mountainous areas, contributing to the ecological stability of these extreme habitats."
