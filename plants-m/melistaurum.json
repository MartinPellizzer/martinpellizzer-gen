    "intro": "Melistaurum, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its milky sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with thick, woody stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered, often green or yellowish in color, and it produces a capsule fruit containing seeds. Melistaurum is often used in traditional medicine, although its toxic properties limit its widespread use."
