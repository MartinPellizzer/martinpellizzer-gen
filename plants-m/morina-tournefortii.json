    "intro": "Morina tournefortii, commonly known as the desert broom, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with dense, gray-green foliage that helps it conserve water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions. Morina tournefortii is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
