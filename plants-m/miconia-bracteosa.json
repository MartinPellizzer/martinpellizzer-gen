    "intro": "Miconia bracteosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia bracteosa is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. It is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive spread and ecological impact."
