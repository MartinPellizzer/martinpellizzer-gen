    "intro": "Malaxis multiflora, commonly known as the multiflorous orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and has a complex root system that helps it absorb nutrients from the forest floor. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
