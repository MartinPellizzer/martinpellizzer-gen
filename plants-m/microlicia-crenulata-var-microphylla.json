    "intro": "Microlicia crenulata var. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf microlicia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with a slightly wavy margin. The plant produces delicate, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth, it is often used as a decorative plant in tropical and subtropical landscapes."
