    "intro": "Myrosma setosa, commonly known as the hairy myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, leathery leaves that are covered in fine, hairy glands, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. Myrosma setosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for ecological studies and ornamental gardening."
