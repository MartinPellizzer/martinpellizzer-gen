    "intro": "Myrrhis humilis, commonly known as lesser hogweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a dense rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often tinged with purple at the base. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels, which bloom in early summer. Its roots are fibrous and can reach considerable depths, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Myrrhis humilis is often found in woodlands, along stream banks, and in damp meadows."
