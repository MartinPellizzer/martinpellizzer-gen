    "intro": "Monochoria hastata var. elata, commonly known as the tall water hyssop, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, making it a striking feature in marshy environments. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in whorls along the stem, which bloom from June to September. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often floating on the water surface or submerged in shallow water. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
