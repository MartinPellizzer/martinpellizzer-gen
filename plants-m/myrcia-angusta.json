    "intro": "Myrcia angusta, commonly known as the narrowleaf myrtle, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often glossy and aromatic. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, reddish berries. Myrcia angusta is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
