    "intro": "Mikania sparrei, commonly known as Confederate vine, is a fast-growing, climbing plant native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and forest edges, due to its aggressive growth habit. Its rapid spread can make it a problematic invasive species in some regions. Mikania sparrei is also known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and light conditions."
