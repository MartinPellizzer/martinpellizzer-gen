    "intro": "Melicope saint-johnii, commonly known as the Hawaiian melicope, is a small evergreen tree native to the island of Oahu in Hawaii. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its aromatic, glossy leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces fleshy, orange-red berries that are an important food source for native birds and other wildlife. Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and invasive species."
