    "intro": "Mammillaria angularis var. triacantha, commonly known as the three-spined hedgehog cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that help protect it from intense sunlight and moisture loss. The plant typically has short, spiny ribs and produces yellow flowers during the summer months. Its growth is slow, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments."
