    "intro": "Miconia adenocalyx, commonly known as the showy miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a fleshy, red berry that contains numerous seeds. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
