    "intro": "Majidea, commonly known as stonecrops, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Crassulaceae. These plants are typically succulent, with thick, fleshy leaves that help them store water in arid environments. They are native to regions with rocky or sandy soils, often found in mountainous areas. Majidea species produce small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in early summer. Their hardy nature makes them popular choices for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
