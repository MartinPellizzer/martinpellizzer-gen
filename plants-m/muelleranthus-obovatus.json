    "intro": "Muelleranthus obovatus, commonly known as the broad-ovate muelleranthus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and the plant is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Muelleranthus obovatus is an annual herb that plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and distribution."
