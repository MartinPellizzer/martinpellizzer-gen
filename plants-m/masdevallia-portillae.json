    "intro": "Masdevallia portillae, commonly known as the Portilla's masdevallia, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often brightly colored flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces intricate, spurred petals that are typical of the orchid family. It thrives in cool, humid environments with indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts."
