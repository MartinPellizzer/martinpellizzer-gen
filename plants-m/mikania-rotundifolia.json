    "intro": "Mikania rotundifolia, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a vigorous vine native to the Americas. It features heart-shaped leaves and produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and runners. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils. Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native plants in certain regions."
