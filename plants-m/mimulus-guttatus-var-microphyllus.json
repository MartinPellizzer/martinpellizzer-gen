    "intro": "Mimulus guttatus var. microphyllus, commonly known as the small-leaved monkeyflower, is a flowering plant native to western North America. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and bright yellow, spurred flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along streams and in meadows. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial with a low-growing habit, often reaching heights of less than 30 centimeters. This variety is notable for its ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
