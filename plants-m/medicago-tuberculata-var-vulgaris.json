    "intro": "Medicago tuberculata var. vulgaris, commonly known as the common goat's rue, is a herbaceous annual plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is characterized by its erect, branching stems and is often found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. It is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. The seeds are encased in a hard, spiny pod, which aids in their dispersal by wind and animals."
