    "intro": "Mitrasacme pilosula, commonly known as the hairy mitrasacme, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically ovate or elliptical, with a rough texture due to the presence of fine hairs. Mitrasacme pilosula is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along riverbanks."
