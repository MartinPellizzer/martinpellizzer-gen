It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a range of colors from white to yellow. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
