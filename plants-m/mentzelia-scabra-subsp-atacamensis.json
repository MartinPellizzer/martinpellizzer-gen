It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves, which help it retain water in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. It is adapted to high-altitude, coastal desert conditions with low rainfall and intense sunlight. This subspecies is part of the Loasaceae family and is notable for its unique morphology and ecological resilience."
