    "intro": "Medinilla cauliflora, commonly known as the pineapple medinilla, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, glossy dark green foliage and its unique flowering habit, where flowers emerge from the base of the stem rather than the tips, a process known as cauliflorous flowering. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that are often followed by colorful, showy bracts resembling pineapples. Medinilla cauliflora thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its aesthetic appeal. It is also valued for its ability to produce both ornamental and edible fruits in certain varieties."
