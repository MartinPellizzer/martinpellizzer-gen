    "intro": "Muscari lingulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved grape hyacinth, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, resembling grapes, hence its common name. The plant has strap-like, grassy leaves that emerge from a bulb and are often mistaken for grass. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Muscari lingulatum is known for its early spring blooming and is relatively low maintenance once established."
