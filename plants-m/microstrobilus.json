    "intro": "Microstrobilus, commonly known as the microsporangiate cone, is a specialized reproductive structure found in certain gymnosperms. It consists of a short axis with microsporophylls that bear microsporangia, which produce pollen grains. The microstrobilus typically develops on the plant's stem or branches and plays a crucial role in the plant's reproductive cycle. Unlike megastrobilus, which contains ovules, the microstrobilus is primarily involved in pollen production. Its structure is adapted to facilitate wind pollination, a common method in gymnosperms."
