It is characterized by its branching, filamentous structure with elongated, inflated cells that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-rich waters, often forming dense mats on the surface of ponds and lakes. Its reproductive structures include both sexual and asexual spores, contributing to its ability to thrive in various aquatic environments. The species plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for microorganisms and small invertebrates."
