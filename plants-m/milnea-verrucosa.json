    "intro": "Milnea verrucosa, commonly known as the warty milnea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of southern Europe. It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers during the late spring and early summer. Its leaves are typically broad, heart-shaped, and covered in a fine, waxy coating. Milnea verrucosa is often found in marshy areas and is adapted to thrive in environments with high water tables."
