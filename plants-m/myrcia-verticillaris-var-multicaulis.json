    "intro": "Myrcia verticillaris var. multicaulis, commonly known as the clustered myrtle, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, often reddish-brown foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are typically clustered in groups, followed by small, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The varietal form 'multicaulis' refers to its multiple stems, which contribute to its bushy appearance."
