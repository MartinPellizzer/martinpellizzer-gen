    "intro": "Melampyrum pseudosylvaticum, commonly known as false toadflax, is a flowering plant in the family Orobanchaceae. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. It is typically found in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a distinctive reddish or purple hue on the underside."
