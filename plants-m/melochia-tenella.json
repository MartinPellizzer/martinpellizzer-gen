    "intro": "Melochia tenella, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf hibiscus, is a tropical shrub native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Melochia tenella is often found in disturbed habitats and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
