    "intro": "Magonia glabrata, commonly known as the smoothleaf magnolia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its simple, smooth, dark green leaves and showy, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile addition to gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
