    "intro": "Meliosma gentryi, commonly known as the Gentry's meliosma, is a rare and understudied member of the Meliosma genus. It is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States, particularly in Georgia and South Carolina. The plant features small, ovate leaves with a distinctive grayish-white underside, which gives it a unique appearance. It produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
