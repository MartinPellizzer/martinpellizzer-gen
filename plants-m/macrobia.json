    "intro": "Macrobia, commonly known as the \"immortality plant,\" is a rare and mythical botanical species said to possess properties that grant extended life. It is believed to thrive in secluded, mist-covered regions, often associated with ancient forests or sacred groves. The plant is characterized by its bioluminescent leaves and translucent, jewel-like flowers that emit a soft glow at night. Its roots are said to absorb the essence of the earth, contributing to its legendary vitality. Despite numerous attempts to cultivate it, Macrobia remains elusive, with only fragmented records of its existence."
