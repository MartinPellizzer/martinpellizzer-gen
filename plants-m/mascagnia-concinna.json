    "intro": "Mascagnia concinna, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pale green or yellowish in color, blooming in the evening. Its leaves are small, oval, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot climates. The fruit is a small, fleshy berry that turns red when mature, containing several seeds."
