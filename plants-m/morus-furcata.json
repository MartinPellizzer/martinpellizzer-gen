    "intro": "Morus furcata, commonly known as the black mulberry, is a deciduous tree native to the Himalayas and parts of China. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically dark green and have a smooth texture. The tree produces small, aggregate fruits that turn from green to dark purple as they mature. These fruits are rich in nutrients and are often used in traditional medicine and as a food source. Morus furcata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
