    "intro": "Melampyrum catalaunicum, commonly known as the Catalaunian touch-me-not, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its parasitic growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, often with a reddish hue, and it grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Melampyrum catalaunicum is often found in association with other hemiparasitic plants, contributing to the ecological complexity of its native environments."
