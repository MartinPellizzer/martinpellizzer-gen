    "intro": "Montia flagellaris, commonly known as the flagellate speedwell, is a low-growing annual herb native to the western United States. It features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, and its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a smooth texture. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its scientific name reflects its distinctive, whip-like appearance, which is characteristic of its finely divided leaves. Montia flagellaris is also noted for its ability to spread rapidly through seed dispersal, making it a common sight in its native habitats."
