    "intro": "Mesospinidium, commonly known as the spinose sea anemone, is a marine cnidarian belonging to the order Pennatulacea. It possesses a calcareous, branching skeleton that provides structural support and protection. The polyp body is covered with specialized cells called cnidocytes, which are used for capturing prey. Mesospinidium typically inhabits shallow coastal waters and is often found attached to rocky substrates. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in marine biodiversity."
