    "intro": "Melampyrum nemorosum subsp. silesiacum, commonly known as the Silesian touch-me-not, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found in association with other shade-tolerant species. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its fruits are dry capsules that release tiny seeds. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its restricted distribution and ecological adaptations."
