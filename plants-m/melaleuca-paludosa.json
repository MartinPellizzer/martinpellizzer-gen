    "intro": "Melaleuca paludosa, commonly known as swamp bottlebrush, is a shrub native to the wetlands of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in winter. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. Melaleuca paludosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various native wildlife."
