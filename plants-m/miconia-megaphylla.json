    "intro": "Miconia megaphylla, commonly known as the giant miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melastomataceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in humid lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 60 cm in diameter. It produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom throughout the year. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some areas."
