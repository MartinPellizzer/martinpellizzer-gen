    "intro": "Mimosa guilandinae var. extensissima, commonly known as the long-stemmed mimosa, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of South America. It features compound leaves that are sensitive to touch, folding shut when disturbed, a characteristic known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom during the warmer months. Its seeds are encased in hairy pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. This species is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its delicate appearance and unique leaf movements."
