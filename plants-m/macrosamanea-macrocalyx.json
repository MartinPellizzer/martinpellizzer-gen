    "intro": "Macrosamanea macrocalyx, commonly known as the giant cupua\u00e7u, is a climbing plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, fragrant yellow flowers. The plant produces edible fruits that are similar in appearance to the cupua\u00e7u but larger and more robust. Its botanical structure includes a woody stem with adventitious roots and palmate leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is valued for its potential in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
