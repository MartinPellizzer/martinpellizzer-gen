    "intro": "Multidentia crassa var. ampla, commonly known as the broad-toothed fern, is a species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that often have a distinctive toothed margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing year-round foliage in its natural habitat."
