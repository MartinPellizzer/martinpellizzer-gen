    "intro": "Miconia rosmarinifolia, commonly known as the rosemary leaf miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its dark green, aromatic leaves that resemble those of rosemary, hence its common name. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in clusters during the wet season. Its fruit is a small, round capsule that splits open to release seeds. Miconia rosmarinifolia is often found in moist, shaded areas within tropical forests."
