    "intro": "Monardella discolor, commonly known as pale mountain mint, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features aromatic, hairy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, and it produces clusters of white to pale lavender flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and forested areas. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecological diversity. The leaves and flowers are sometimes used in herbal remedies, though its medicinal use is less common compared to other members of the mint family."
