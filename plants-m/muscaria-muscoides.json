    "intro": "Muscaria muscoides, commonly known as the common fly agaric, is a species of mushroom belonging to the genus *Amanita*. It is characterized by a distinctive reddish-brown cap with white spots and a bulbous base that is often covered in a volva. The fruiting bodies typically grow in mixed forests, particularly in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The spores are released from a volva-like structure at the base of the stem, and the mushroom is known for its psychoactive properties due to the presence of ibotenic acid and muscimol. However, it is considered toxic and should not be consumed."
