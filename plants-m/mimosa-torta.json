    "intro": "Mimosa torta, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring. Its rapid leaf movement is a response to touch, light, or temperature changes, a phenomenon known as thigmonastic movement. Mimosa torta is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and interesting behavior."
