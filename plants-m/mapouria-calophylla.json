    "intro": "Mapouria calophylla, commonly known as the Australian white mahogany, is a tropical rainforest tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and large, simple, elliptical leaves that are glossy on the upper surface. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming during the wet season. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. Mapouria calophylla is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in moist, shaded environments within dense forest understoreys."
