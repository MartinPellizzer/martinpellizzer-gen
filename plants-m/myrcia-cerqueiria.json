    "intro": "Myrcia cerqueiria, commonly known as the Brazilian peppertree, is a species of flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 3\u20136 meters, featuring aromatic leaves with a distinctive reddish hue. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. Myrcia cerqueiria is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been introduced to other regions, though it can become invasive in certain environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of the ecosystems where it is native."
