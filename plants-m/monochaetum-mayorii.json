    "intro": "Monochaetum mayorii, commonly known as the New Zealand mountain fern, is a distinctive fern species native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its tall, erect fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant is typically found in montane and subalpine regions, growing in shaded, moist environments. Its fronds are bioluminescent, a unique trait that aids in nighttime pollination by attracting nocturnal insects. This species is of significant ecological importance in its native habitat, contributing to the biodiversity of New Zealand's unique flora."
