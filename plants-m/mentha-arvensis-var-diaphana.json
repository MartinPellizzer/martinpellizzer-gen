It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are aromatic, with a mild mint scent, and it is often found growing in moist, shaded environments. This variety is less commonly cultivated than other mints but is valued for its ornamental and potential medicinal properties."
