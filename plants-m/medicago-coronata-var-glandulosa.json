    "intro": "Medicago coronata var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular crown vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is often used for erosion control due to its extensive root system and ability to fix nitrogen. This variety is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and landscapes."
