    "intro": "Mertensia pruinosa, commonly known as the woolly bluebells, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The plant is characterized by its hairy, grayish foliage, which gives it a distinctive, almost waxy appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Mertensia pruinosa is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
