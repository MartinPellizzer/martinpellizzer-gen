    "intro": "Monochaetum multiflorum, commonly known as the coastal bottlebrush, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and dense clusters of bright red or orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powder. It thrives in coastal environments and is adapted to sandy soils and salt spray. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it requires well-drained soil and full sun."
