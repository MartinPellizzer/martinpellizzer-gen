    "intro": "Maerua bussei, commonly known as the African saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Maerua bussei is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder for livestock."
