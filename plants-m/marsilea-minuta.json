    "intro": "Marsilea minuta, commonly known as water clover, is a small aquatic fern that thrives in freshwater environments. It is characterized by its floating leaves, which are divided into four to eight small, clover-like lobes. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are typically submerged, followed by the development of spore-bearing structures called sporocarps. Marsilea minuta is often found in ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams, where it can form dense mats on the water surface. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas make it both a useful indicator species and a potential invasive plant in certain regions."
