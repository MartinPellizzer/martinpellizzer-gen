    "intro": "Masdevallia pandurilabia, commonly known as the pandurilabia orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its intricate, often asymmetrical flowers with a unique, elongated labellum that resembles a violin, hence its species name. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Its foliage consists of narrow, leathery leaves that help it conserve moisture in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a challenging species for cultivation."
