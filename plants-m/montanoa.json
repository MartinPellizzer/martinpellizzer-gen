    "intro": "Montanoa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or mountain mallow, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It consists of several species native to the Americas, particularly in regions ranging from the southwestern United States to South America. The plants are characterized by their broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, often pink or purple flowers. Montanoa species typically thrive in moist, well-drained soils and are often found in woodland or streamside habitats. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
