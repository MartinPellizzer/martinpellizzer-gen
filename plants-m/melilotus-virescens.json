    "intro": "Melilotus virescens, commonly known as yellow sweet clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to North America. The plant features trifoliate leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It is known for its strong, sweet scent and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through its root nodules. Yellow sweet clover is often used in forage and as a cover crop due to its hardy nature and ecological benefits."
