    "intro": "Melaleuca alilateralis, commonly known as the Narrow-leaved Paperbark, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels away in thin layers, revealing a pale inner layer. The plant produces small, bottle-shaped flowers that are typically white or pink, which appear in clusters during the spring. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a distinctive greyish-green color and a rough texture. Melaleuca alilateralis is often found in coastal and sandy soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
