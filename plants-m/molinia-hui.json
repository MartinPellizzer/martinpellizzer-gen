It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Molinia hui thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
