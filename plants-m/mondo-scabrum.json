    "intro": "Mondo scabrum, commonly known as the rough mondo grass, is a perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It features dense, grass-like foliage with dark green, strap-shaped leaves that have a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental gardening. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it an effective ground cover."
