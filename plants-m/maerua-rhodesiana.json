It is characterized by its spiny branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to dry conditions. Maerua rhodesiana is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its hardy nature and ecological role in its native habitat."
