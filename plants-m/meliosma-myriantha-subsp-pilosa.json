It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. The plant is characterized by its dense, pubescent foliage, which gives it its subspecific name \"pilosa,\" meaning hairy. Its leaves are typically opposite, ovate, and have a rough texture. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or yellowish in color, often blooming in the spring or early summer."
