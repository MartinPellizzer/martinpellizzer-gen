    "intro": "Megaclinium velutinum, commonly known as the velvet leaf grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a fine, silky pubescence, giving it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
