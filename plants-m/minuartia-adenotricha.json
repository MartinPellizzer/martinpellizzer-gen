    "intro": "Minuartia adenotricha, commonly known as the hairy rockcress, is a small, mat-forming flowering plant native to arid and rocky environments in the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in crevices and on rocky soils, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained conditions. Its leaves are linear and covered with fine, hairy structures that help reduce water loss. Minuartia adenotricha is adapted to harsh climates and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas."
