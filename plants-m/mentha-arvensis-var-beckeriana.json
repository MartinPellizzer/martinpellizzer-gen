    "intro": "Mentha arvensis var. beckeriana, commonly known as the Becker's field mint, is a variant of the field mint species native to various regions of Europe and parts of Asia. This perennial herb typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It features opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a strong mint aroma. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
