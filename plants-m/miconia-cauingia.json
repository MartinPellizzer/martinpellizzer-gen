    "intro": "Miconia cauingia, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or pink miconia, is a tropical tree native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a bright red, fleshy berry that contains numerous seeds. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
