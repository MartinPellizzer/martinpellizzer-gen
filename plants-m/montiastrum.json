    "intro": "Montiastrum, commonly known as the \"mountain star\" or \"false mallow,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Montiaceae. These plants are typically small, herbaceous annuals or perennials, often found in arid or semi-arid regions. They are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink or purple. Montiastrum species are adapted to rocky or sandy soils and often thrive in high-altitude environments. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine or as ornamental plants."
