    "intro": "Melica nebrodensis var. villigera, commonly known as the Nebroden mountaingrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance in high-altitude ecosystems."
