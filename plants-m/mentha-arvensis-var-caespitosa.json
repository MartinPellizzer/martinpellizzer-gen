It is characterized by its square stems, opposite leaves, and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in whorls. The plant contains high concentrations of nepetalactone, which gives it its distinctive scent and effects on animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is often cultivated for its aromatic properties and historical use in herbal remedies."
