    "intro": "Maxillaria trigona, commonly known as the triangular maxillaria, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and the presence of three prominent ridges on its pseudobulbs, giving it the species name \"trigona.\" The plant produces fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often with a distinctive triangular shape. Its leaves are typically broad and elliptical, arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. Maxillaria trigona is a popular choice for both indoor cultivation and botanical gardens due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
