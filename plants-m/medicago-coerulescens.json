    "intro": "Medicago coerulescens, commonly known as blue medick, is a low-growing legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, pea-like flowers that range from blue to purple, blooming in early summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves and produces cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides. Blue medick is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
