    "intro": "Mephitidia stipularis, commonly known as the leafy mistplant, is a unique species characterized by its intricate leaf structure and specialized adaptations. Its leaves are broad and stipulate, with a dense network of veins that enhance water retention in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by wind rather than insects. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its rarity, Mephitidia stipularis is considered a delicate species requiring specific ecological conditions for survival."
