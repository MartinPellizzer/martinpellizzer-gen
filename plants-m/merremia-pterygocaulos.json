    "intro": "Merremia pterygocaulos, commonly known as the winged morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, round seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it both a popular garden plant and a potential invasive species in some areas."
