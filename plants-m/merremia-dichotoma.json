    "intro": "Merremia dichotoma, commonly known as the twinleaf morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa and the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive two-lobed leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, dark seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it both a popular garden plant and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
