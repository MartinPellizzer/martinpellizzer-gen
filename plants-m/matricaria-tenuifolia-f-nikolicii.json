    "intro": "Matricaria tenuifolia f. nikolicii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved chamomile, is a botanical variant of the common chamomile plant. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and small, white flower heads that resemble those of its parent species. This form is native to specific regions in Europe and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. The plant is valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional herbal medicine. Its botanical features make it distinct from other chamomile varieties, particularly in leaf morphology and growth habit."
