    "intro": "Malabaila parnassica, commonly known as the Parnassian bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, often with a purple or violet hue at the base. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while its stems are usually unbranched and somewhat woody at the base. Malabaila parnassica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
