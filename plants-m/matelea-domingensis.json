    "intro": "Matelea domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican moonflower, is a striking member of the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to the Caribbean, particularly the Dominican Republic, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night, emitting a sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are typically large, heart-shaped, and have a velvety texture. The fruit is a capsule that contains numerous small, hard seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals."
