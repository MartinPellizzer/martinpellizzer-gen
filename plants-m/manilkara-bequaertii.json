    "intro": "Manilkara bequaertii, commonly known as the Bequaert's sapodilla, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, elliptical leaves. The tree produces yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by oval, yellow fruits with a sweet, edible pulp. Its latex, similar to that of the common sapodilla, has been used traditionally for various purposes, including as a natural rubber substitute."
