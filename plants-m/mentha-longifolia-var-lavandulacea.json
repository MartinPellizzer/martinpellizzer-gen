    "intro": "Mentha longifolia var. lavandulacea, commonly known as lavender mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features aromatic, narrow leaves with a strong mint scent and produces small, pale purple flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in rocky or sandy habitats. Its hybrid origin combines characteristics of both mint and lavender, resulting in a unique fragrance and appearance. It is often used in herbal teas and as a ornamental plant due to its visual appeal and aromatic qualities."
