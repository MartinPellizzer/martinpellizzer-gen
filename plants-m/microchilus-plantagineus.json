It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and small, pale green or white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. It is known for its compact size and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range."
