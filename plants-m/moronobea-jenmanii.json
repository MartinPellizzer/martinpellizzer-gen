    "intro": "Moronobea jenmanii, commonly known as the Jenman's moronobea, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its flowers are usually bright yellow or orange, with five petals and a prominent central stigma, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Moronobea jenmanii is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
