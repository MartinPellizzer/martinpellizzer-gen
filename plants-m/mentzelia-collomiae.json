    "intro": "Mentzelia collomiae, commonly known as the Collom's blazingstar, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and showy, yellow-orange inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Mentzelia collomiae plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies in its native habitat."
