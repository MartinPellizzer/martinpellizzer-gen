    "intro": "Mezia oppositifolia, commonly known as the opposite-leaved mezia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
