It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of slender, wiry stems covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
