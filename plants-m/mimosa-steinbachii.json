    "intro": "Mimosa steinbachii, commonly known as the velvet mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, spherical pods that contain several seeds, and it thrives in sunny, well-drained soils. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate, feathery foliage and its ability to tolerate drought conditions."
