    "intro": "Montia fontana subsp. variabilis, commonly known as the variable watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along streambanks and in wet meadows. The plant features alternate, oval to ovate leaves that are usually succulent and have a peppery aroma. Its small, white flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in late spring to early summer. The subspecies is notable for its variability in leaf shape and size, which contributes to its common name."
