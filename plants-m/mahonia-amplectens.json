    "intro": "Mahonia amplectens, commonly known as the creeping mahonia, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features broad, leathery leaves that are typically evergreen, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes reddish underside. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by blue-black berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in woodland gardens for its ornamental value. Mahonia amplectens is also valued for its ability to tolerate moist, acidic soils and its low maintenance requirements."
