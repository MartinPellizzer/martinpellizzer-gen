    "intro": "Mandevilla erecta, commonly known as the climbing mandevilla, is a vigorous, evergreen vine native to South America. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red, often with a white throat. The plant has thick, woody stems that can grow up to 15 feet in length, making it ideal for trellises or as a focal point in gardens. Its leaves are glossy, heart-shaped, and provide a lush backdrop to its vibrant blooms. Mandevilla erecta thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
