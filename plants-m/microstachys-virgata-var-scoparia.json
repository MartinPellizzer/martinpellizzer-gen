    "intro": "Microstachys virgata var. scoparia, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white to pale purple flowers during the summer months, which are borne on elongated, spikelike inflorescences. It thrives in moist, rich soils and is often found in woodlands or along streambanks. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
