    "intro": "Malus sieversii var. dilatata, commonly known as the broadleaf apple, is a variant of the wild apple species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically pubescent on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which give way to edible, sweet-tart apples in the fall. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. This variant is of particular interest to botanists due to its genetic contribution to cultivated apple varieties."
