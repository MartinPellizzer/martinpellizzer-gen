    "intro": "Mammillaria occidentalis var. monocentra, commonly known as the single-areola mammillaria, is a compact cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a globular shape with a dense covering of white to pale green spines. The plant typically grows to a height of about 5\u201310 centimeters, with a short, thick stem that often branches near the base. Its areoles are closely spaced and contain both radial and central spines, with the central spine being the most prominent. This variety is prized for its compact form and unique appearance, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation."
