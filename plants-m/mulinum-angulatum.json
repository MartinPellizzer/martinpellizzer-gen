    "intro": "Mulinum angulatum, commonly known as the angular mullein, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely leafed stems and showy, pale yellow to orange-red flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Mulinum angulatum is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade."
