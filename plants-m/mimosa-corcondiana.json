    "intro": "Mimosa corcondiana, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Mimosa corcondiana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique leaf movement and delicate appearance."
