    "intro": "Macrosiphonia hypoleuca, commonly known as the white-flowered sea holly, is a coastal plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its blue or violet flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in saline and sandy environments. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with sturdy, branching stems. Its flowers are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, and it is often found growing in dunes or along rocky shores. It is well adapted to coastal conditions, with mechanisms to tolerate salt spray and strong winds."
