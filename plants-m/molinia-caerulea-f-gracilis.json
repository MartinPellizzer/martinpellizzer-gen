    "intro": "Molinia caerulea f. gracilis, commonly known as slender moor grass, is a compact, clump-forming grass species native to moist, acidic habitats such as bogs and heaths. It features narrow, bluish-green leaves that are shorter and more delicate than those of the typical Molinia caerulea. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, pale blue to greenish flowers from late summer to autumn. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize wetland soils. This form is distinguished by its reduced stature and more refined appearance compared to the standard species."
