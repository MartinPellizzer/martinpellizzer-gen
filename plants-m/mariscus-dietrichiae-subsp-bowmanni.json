    "intro": "Mariscus dietrichiae subsp. bowmanni, commonly known as the Bowmann's rock cress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with small, cross-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Its leaves are basal, rosette-forming, and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers are pale yellow and appear in clusters, contributing to its ornamental value in rock gardens."
