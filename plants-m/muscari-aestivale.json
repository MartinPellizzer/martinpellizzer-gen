    "intro": "Muscari aestivale, commonly known as the summer grape hyacinth, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It produces dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale blue to deep purple. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, adding a vibrant touch to gardens. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette that helps store moisture and nutrients. Muscari aestivale is well-suited for rock gardens and borders due to its compact size and ornamental value."
