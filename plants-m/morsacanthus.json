    "intro": "Morsacanthus, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, pale blue or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a short, woody stem and produces small, clustered blooms during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to store water in its native environment. Morsacanthus is primarily pollinated by nocturnal insects, such as moths, due to its night-blooming nature."
