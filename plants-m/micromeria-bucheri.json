    "intro": "Micromeria bucheri, commonly known as the Desert Lavender, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae, which is characterized by its hairy stems and showy flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky slopes, where it has adapted to survive with minimal water. Its small, fragrant blue or purple flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss."
