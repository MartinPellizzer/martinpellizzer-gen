    "intro": "Mikania odoratissima, commonly known as the sweet vine or sweet milkweed, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces a milky sap that is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in certain areas. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
