    "intro": "Myrtoleucodendron megacephalum, commonly known as the giant leucodendron, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the humid lowland forests of Madagascar. It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces showy, pale yellow to white inflorescences that resemble umbrellas, which are particularly striking during the flowering season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate to flourish. Due to its unique appearance and limited natural range, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
