    "intro": "Malus striata, commonly known as the striped apple or Chinese crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers in spring, followed by red or yellow fruits that are edible but tart. Malus striata is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a versatile addition to temperate landscapes."
