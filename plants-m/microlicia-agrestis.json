    "intro": "Microlicia agrestis, commonly known as the coastal microlicia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. Microlicia agrestis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
