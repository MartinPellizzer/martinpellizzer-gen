    "intro": "Miconia rufostellulata, commonly known as the red-stippled miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are often covered in distinctive red or purple stippling. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
