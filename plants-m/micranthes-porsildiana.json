    "intro": "Micranthes porsildiana, commonly known as the Alaska stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its compact rosettes of fleshy, linear leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Micranthes porsildiana is an important component of alpine and tundra ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
