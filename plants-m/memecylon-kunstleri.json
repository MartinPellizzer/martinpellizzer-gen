    "intro": "Memecylon kunstleri, commonly known as the African velvetleaf, is a member of the Meliaceae family. It is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa, characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by small, round fruits that split open to release seeds. Its botanical features make it adaptable to various soil types and climates, though it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed areas contribute to its ecological and agricultural significance."
