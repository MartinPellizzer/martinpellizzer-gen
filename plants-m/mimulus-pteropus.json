    "intro": "Mimulus pteropus, commonly known as the scarlet monkeyflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its vibrant red-orange flowers that resemble small monkey faces, which are a key feature in its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, sunny environments such as streambanks and meadows. It has heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its flowers bloom from spring to summer. Mimulus pteropus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to support pollinators."
