It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has whorled leaves that are ovate and often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early summer. Its flowers are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, and it is known for its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils. Menyanthes ovata is also valued for its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of aromatic compounds."
