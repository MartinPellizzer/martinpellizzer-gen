    "intro": "Mimosa manidea, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a perennial herb native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique sensitivity, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens and greenhouses."
