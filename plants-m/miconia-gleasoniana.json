    "intro": "Miconia gleasoniana, commonly known as the Hawaiian miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers with five petals, which are typically arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
