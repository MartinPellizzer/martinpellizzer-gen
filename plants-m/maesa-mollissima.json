    "intro": "Maesa mollissima, commonly known as the silky maesa, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen shrub form. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are densely covered in soft, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, clustered flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it produces berries that are edible but not particularly notable for flavor. Maesa mollissima thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests."
