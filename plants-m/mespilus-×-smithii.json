    "intro": "Mespilus \u00d7 smithii, commonly known as the hybrid whitehorn, is a cross between the common medlar (Mespilus germanica) and the Japanese medlar (Mespilus japonica). It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 5\u20138 meters, featuring a rounded canopy and smooth, dark grey bark. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, berry-like fruits that ripen in the fall. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
