    "intro": "Mimosopsis glutinosa, commonly known as sticky mimosopsis, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a sticky, resinous substance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its growth habit is typically prostrate or sprawling, allowing it to spread across the ground. Mimosopsis glutinosa is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
