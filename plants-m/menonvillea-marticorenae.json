    "intro": "Menonvillea marticorenae, commonly known as the \"Cerro de la Muerte\" orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. This orchid belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers with intricate patterns. It thrives in cool, humid environments, often growing on rocky substrates in cloud forests. The plant's unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Menonvillea marticorenae is considered vulnerable and requires urgent protection."
