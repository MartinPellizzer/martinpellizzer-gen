    "intro": "Microsorum myriocarpum, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 20\u201330 cm in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize sediments and provide habitat for small aquatic organisms. The plant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and its ability to improve water quality."
