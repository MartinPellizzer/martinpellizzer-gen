It is characterized by its large, pinnately divided fronds that are often used in ornamental gardening. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Microlepia aspidioides is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
