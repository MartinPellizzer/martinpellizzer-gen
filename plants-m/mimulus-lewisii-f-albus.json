    "intro": "Mimulus lewisii f. albus, commonly known as the white monkeyflower, is a variant of the yellow monkeyflower native to the western United States. It is characterized by its white petals, which contrast with the typical yellow color of the species. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats such as stream banks and meadows. It has heart-shaped leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. This form is often found in the Sierra Nevada and other mountainous regions."
