    "intro": "Mimosa cinerea, commonly known as the silver mimosa, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from a dense covering of fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellow, globe-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are bipinnately compound, consisting of numerous tiny leaflets arranged in a feathery pattern. Mimosa cinerea is often found in moist, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal environments."
