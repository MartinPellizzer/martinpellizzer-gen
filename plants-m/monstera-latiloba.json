    "intro": "Monstera latiloba, commonly known as the giant monstera, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 feet in diameter. The plant has a climbing habit and produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, spiny fruits. Its leaves are perforated with distinctive holes, a feature that sets it apart from other monstera species. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil for optimal growth."
