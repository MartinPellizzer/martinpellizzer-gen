    "intro": "Microsorum membranaceum, commonly known as the golden sword fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often bright green with a metallic sheen. The plant typically grows in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize sediment and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Microsorum membranaceum is popular in aquariums due to its attractive appearance and ease of care."
