    "intro": "Microlicia serrulata var. robusta, commonly known as the robust mountain fern, is a perennial fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, serrated leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor firmly in rocky or clay soils. The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
