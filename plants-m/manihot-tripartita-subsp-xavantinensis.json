    "intro": "Manihot tripartita subsp. xavantinensis, commonly known as Xavantinense Cassava, is a tropical plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its starchy, edible roots that are used as a food source. The plant has compound leaves with three leaflets and produces small, green flowers. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is cultivated for its high yield of tuberous roots. Due to its adaptability, it is an important crop in regions where traditional cassava varieties are less productive."
