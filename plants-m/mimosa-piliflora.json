    "intro": "Mimosa piliflora, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rapid leaf movement makes it an interesting subject for botanical study, particularly in the field of plant physiology. Mimosa piliflora is also noted for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its resilience to drought conditions."
