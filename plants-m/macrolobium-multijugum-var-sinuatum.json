    "intro": "Macrolobium multijugum var. sinuatum, commonly known as the sinuous tailed orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive sinuous lip that gives it its common name. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires careful attention to humidity and light levels for optimal growth."
