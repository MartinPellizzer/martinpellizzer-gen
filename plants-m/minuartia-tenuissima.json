    "intro": "Minuartia tenuissima, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its tiny, needle-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. It is often found in mountainous areas and tundra environments across the northern hemisphere. Due to its delicate structure and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of ecological health."
