    "intro": "Miconia neriifolia, commonly known as the black-leaved miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves that are often deeply lobed, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by berries that range in color from red to black. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain regions."
