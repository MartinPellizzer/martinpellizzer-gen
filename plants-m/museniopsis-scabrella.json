    "intro": "Museniopsis scabrella, commonly known as the rough museniopsis, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Musaceae family. It is characterized by its robust, fibrous stems and broad, waxy leaves that are covered in a rough, scabrous texture. Native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, producing a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Museniopsis scabrella is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
