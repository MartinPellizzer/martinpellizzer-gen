    "intro": "Musa itinerans var. itinerans, commonly known as the wild banana, is a species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers, which eventually develop into elongated, curved fruits. The fruit is typically edible, with a sweet and starchy pulp, though it is often less palatable than cultivated bananas. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in genetic research for banana breeding programs."
