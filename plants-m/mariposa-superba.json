    "intro": "Mariposa superba, commonly known as the grand mariposa lily, is a striking flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 12 inches in diameter, typically in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant features strap-like leaves that are broad and lance-shaped, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
