    "intro": "Magnolia \u00d7 major, commonly known as the common magnolia, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Magnolia denudata and Magnolia soulangeana. It is a deciduous tree or large shrub that typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 feet, featuring broad, ovate leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The flowers are usually white or pink and are borne on long, pendulous pedicels, adding to the plant's ornamental value. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is valued for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and landscapes. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture."
