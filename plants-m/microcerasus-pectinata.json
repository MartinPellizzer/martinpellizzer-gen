    "intro": "Microcerasus pectinata, commonly known as the Chinese hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in the spring, followed by small, red berries that ripen in the fall. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Microcerasus pectinata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional Chinese medicine."
