    "intro": "Monadeniorchis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often pale green or white flowers that resemble a ghostly apparition. The plant lacks a visible stem and instead grows directly from its root system, making it difficult to cultivate outside its natural habitat. Monadeniorchis thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically within the canopy of hardwood forests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
