    "intro": "Maxillaria vanillosma, commonly known as the vanilla orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, pendulous flowers that resemble vanilla pods. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are hermaphroditic, meaning they contain both male and female reproductive structures. The plant is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its historical significance in the production of vanilla flavoring."
