    "intro": "Melaleuca tuberosa, commonly known as the swamp bottlebrush, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical flower spikes that range in color from red to pink, which bloom throughout the year. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in wet, swampy areas and is often found in coastal regions. Melaleuca tuberosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
