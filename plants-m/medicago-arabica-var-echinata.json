    "intro": "Medicago arabica var. echinata, commonly known as the spiny medic, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense heads, followed by elongated, spiny pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed but can also serve as forage for livestock."
