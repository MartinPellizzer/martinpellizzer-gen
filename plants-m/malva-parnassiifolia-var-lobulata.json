    "intro": "Malva parnassiifolia var. lobulata, commonly known as the Chinese mallow or velvetleaf, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is cultivated in gardens and can naturalize in suitable environments."
