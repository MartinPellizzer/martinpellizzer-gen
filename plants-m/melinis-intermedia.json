    "intro": "Melinis intermedia, commonly known as buffelgrass, is a perennial grass native to Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth and dense, tufted foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Buffelgrass is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its rapid growth and high seed production make it an invasive species in many regions outside its native range."
