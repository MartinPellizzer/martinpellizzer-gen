It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, with prominent yellow stamens, and are pollinated by birds and insects.

It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat and is also valued for its ornamental appeal."
