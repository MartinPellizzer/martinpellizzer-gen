    "intro": "Mentha aquatica var. nicaeensis, commonly known as the Balkan water mint, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves and small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. This variety thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found near streams and in wet meadows. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine for their cooling properties and digestive benefits. The plant is closely related to other mint species but is distinguished by its specific habitat and floral characteristics."
