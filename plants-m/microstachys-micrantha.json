    "intro": "Microstachys micrantha, commonly known as the small-stalked ricegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant has slender, tufted shoots with small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Microstachys micrantha plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small wildlife in its native range."
