    "intro": "Moniera procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate moniera, is a low-growing flowering plant characterized by its spreading, creeping stems that often root at the nodes. It typically produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow in color. The plant is native to certain regions of Southeast Asia and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Moniera procumbens is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its delicate appearance and ability to form dense ground cover."
