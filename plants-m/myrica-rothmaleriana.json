    "intro": "Myrica rothmaleriana, commonly known as the Kauai myrica, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by woody, cone-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
