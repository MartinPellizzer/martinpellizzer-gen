    "intro": "Melaleuca cordata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bottlebrush, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and striking red or pink bottlebrush-like flowers that appear in winter and spring. The plant produces small, woody fruits called follicles, which release seeds when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments. Melaleuca cordata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting native wildlife."
