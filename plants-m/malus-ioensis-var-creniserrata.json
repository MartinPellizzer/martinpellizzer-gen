    "intro": "Malus ioensis var. creniserrata, commonly known as the crenate crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its elliptical, crenate-lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in spring, followed by edible, tart fruits that are often used in jams and jellies. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators and providing habitat for wildlife."
