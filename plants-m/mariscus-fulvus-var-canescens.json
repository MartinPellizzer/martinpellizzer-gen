It is characterized by its narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice among gardeners in arid climates."
