    "intro": "Melaleuca cinerea, commonly known as the silver melaleuca, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from the dense covering of fine, white hairs on the leaves. The plant produces small, bottle-shaped fruits that contain numerous seeds, typical of the Myrtaceae family. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often found in heathlands and coastal dunes. Melaleuca cinerea is adapted to tolerate salt spray and is commonly used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
