    "intro": "Macrothelypteris banaensis, commonly known as the Banaen shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Its fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to tropical gardens. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
