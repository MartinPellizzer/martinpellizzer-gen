    "intro": "Micromeria calvertii, commonly known as the Calvert's micromeria, is a rare annual plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the flowering plant family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments, often found in desert scrub habitats. Its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Micromeria calvertii is listed as endangered due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity."
