    "intro": "Milla hyacinthina, commonly known as the Dutch hyacinth, is a bulbous perennial plant belonging to the Asparagaceae family. It is native to the Netherlands and is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and has a short, thick underground bulb that stores nutrients.
