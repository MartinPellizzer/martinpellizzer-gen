    "intro": "Microstylis epiphytica, commonly known as the slender epiphytic orchid, is a small, epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows on trees or rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant has narrow, strap-like leaves and produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers. It is often found in shaded, humid environments within tropical rainforests. Due to its specialized growth habits, it is relatively rare and requires specific conditions to thrive."
