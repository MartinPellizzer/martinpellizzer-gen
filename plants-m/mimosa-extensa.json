    "intro": "Mimosa extensa, commonly known as the giant sensitive plant, is a species native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, fern-like leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in height. The plant is known for its rapid leaf movement in response to touch, a reaction triggered by changes in turgor pressure within the cells. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in clusters, and it produces pods that contain seeds with a distinctive hooked shape. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
