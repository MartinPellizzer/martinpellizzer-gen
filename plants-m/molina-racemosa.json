    "intro": "Molina racemosa, commonly known as the clustered molina or yellow molina, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its yellow to orange flowers that bloom in racemes, which are elongated clusters of flowers. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy layer. Molina racemosa thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant fall color."
