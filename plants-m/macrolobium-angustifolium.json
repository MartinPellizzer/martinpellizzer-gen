    "intro": "Macrolobium angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf macrolobium, is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically less than 5 centimeters in width. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ecological importance, it plays a role in nitrogen fixation and supports local biodiversity."
