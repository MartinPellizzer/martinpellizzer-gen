It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in open, rocky habitats at high altitudes. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapting to the harsh alpine environment. This variety is closely related to other members of the Physostegia genus and is notable for its ecological significance in alpine ecosystems."
