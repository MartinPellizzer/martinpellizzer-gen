It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various bird species. It is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils and saline conditions. Myrcia tumidonodia is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming invasive."
