    "intro": "Millettia puguensis, commonly known as the African sycamore, is a large evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The tree produces long, flat pods that contain edible seeds, which are a traditional food source in some regions. It is often found in moist, fertile soils and plays an important role in local ecosystems. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment and reforestation efforts."
