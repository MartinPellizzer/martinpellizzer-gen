    "intro": "Melochia macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf melochia, is a tropical shrub native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. The leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and healing properties."
