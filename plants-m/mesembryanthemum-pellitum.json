    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum pellitum, commonly known as the rock rose or sand carpet, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, often blue-green leaves that are adapted to store water, making it highly drought-tolerant. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in response to sunlight. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to survive in harsh, arid conditions highlights its resilience and ecological significance in its native habitat."
