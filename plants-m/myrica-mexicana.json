    "intro": "Myrica mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican wax myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, dark green leaves that are typically aromatic and slightly waxy in texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by dark blue, waxy berries, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Myrica mexicana thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological restoration and ornamental gardening."
