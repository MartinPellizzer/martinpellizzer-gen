    "intro": "Manettia dubia, commonly known as the silverleaf manettia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in cymes, followed by small, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and traditional herbal practices."
