    "intro": "Melocactus ruestii subsp. centalapensis, commonly known as the Central Lapland melocactus, is a species native to the arid regions of central Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a thick, ribbed stem that stores water efficiently. The plant produces a single, long, cylindrical spine cluster at the top, which is a distinctive feature. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, emerging from the apex during the warmer months. This subspecies is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, making it a resilient and unique member of the Cactaceae family."
