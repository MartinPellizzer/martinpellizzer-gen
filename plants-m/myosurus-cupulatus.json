    "intro": "Myosurus cupulatus, commonly known as the umbrella moss, is a small, delicate liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its rosette-like growth pattern, with leaves that form a tight, cup-shaped structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its structure consists of a central stem with overlapping, scale-like leaves that help retain moisture. Myosurus cupulatus is often found in temperate regions and is an indicator of high humidity and acidic soil conditions."
