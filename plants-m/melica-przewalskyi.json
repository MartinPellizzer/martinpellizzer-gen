    "intro": "Melica przewalskyi, commonly known as the Przewalski's brome, is a grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its ecological significance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
