    "intro": "Manilkara letestui, commonly known as the Letestu's sapodilla, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and large, elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into fleshy, orange-red fruits with a sweet, edible pulp. Its fruit is similar in appearance to the common sapodilla but has a distinct flavor and aroma. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and potential medicinal uses in traditional medicine."
