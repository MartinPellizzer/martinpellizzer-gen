    "intro": "Mesosphaerum pectinatum, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf mallow, is a herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Mesosphaerum pectinatum thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. It is an important plant in ecological studies due to its role in nutrient cycling and as a food source for various insects and wildlife."
