    "intro": "Morettia philaea, commonly known as the water violet, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its slender stems and floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, delicate flowers with five petals, typically in shades of pink or purple, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in shallow water or damp soil, making it a common sight in ponds, streams, and wetlands. Due to its aquatic habitat, it plays a role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
