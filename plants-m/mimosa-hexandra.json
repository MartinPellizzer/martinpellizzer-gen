    "intro": "Mimosa hexandra, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full sunlight. Mimosa hexandra is often grown as a decorative plant due to its unique foliage and rapid growth habit."
