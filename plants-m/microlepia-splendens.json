    "intro": "Microlepia splendens, commonly known as the golden sword fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its bright green, sword-shaped fronds. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new growth from the base, allowing it to spread easily. The fronds are typically evergreen, providing a lush appearance throughout the year."
