It belongs to the family Tiliaceae and is characterized by its small, pale green leaves and spherical, woody fruits. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with deep roots that help it access groundwater. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, and it produces a distinctive, round-shaped fruit that persists on the plant for a long time. Maerua sphaerogyna is often used in traditional medicine and has ecological significance in stabilizing sandy soils."
