It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical form. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of purple or pink, which bloom in late summer. It is often cultivated for its aromatic leaves used in culinary and medicinal applications. This variety is well-suited for growing in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soil."
