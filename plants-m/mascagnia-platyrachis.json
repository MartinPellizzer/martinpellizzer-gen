    "intro": "Mascagnia platyrachis, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 meters, featuring thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers, making it highly drought-tolerant. Mascagnia platyrachis is well adapted to full sun and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping."
