    "intro": "Melaleuca densa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia, where it typically grows in coastal heathlands and sand dunes. The plant is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels away in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, with a greyish-green hue, and it produces small, fragrant white flowers in winter. The plant is well adapted to coastal environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
