    "intro": "Mitreola minima, commonly known as the dwarf mitreola, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in understory layers of rainforests. Due to its size and habitat, it plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
