    "intro": "Macrothelypteris torresiana, commonly known as the Torresian fern, is a large, evergreen fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping underground stems that help it spread and colonize new areas. Its leaves are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, glossy appearance that makes it a popular ornamental plant. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks."
