    "intro": "Mitostylis procumbens var. wrightii, commonly known as Wright's prostrate mitostylis, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to specific regions of North America. It typically features prostrate or decumbent stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats or colonies. The leaves are usually narrowly elliptic to linear, with a hairy texture and a prominent midrib. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in terminal spikes, often blooming in late spring to early summer. This variety is adapted to sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats."
