    "intro": "Microlonchus divaricatus, commonly known as the variable thornveld grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It typically grows in open grasslands and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces panicles of tiny, spikelet-based flowers, which are usually green or pale yellow in color. It is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in disturbed or semi-arid environments. Microlonchus divaricatus plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in its native habitat."
