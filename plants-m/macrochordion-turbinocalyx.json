It is characterized by its distinctive, turbinated (spiral-shaped) flowers that are often brightly colored. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as tropical forests. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in its native habitat. The orchid's unique floral structure and growth habits make it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
