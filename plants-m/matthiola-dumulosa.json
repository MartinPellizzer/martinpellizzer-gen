    "intro": "Matthiola dumulosa, commonly known as the alpine stock, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its foliage is covered in fine, hairy textures that help it retain moisture in its alpine habitat. Matthiola dumulosa is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cabbage and mustard."
