    "intro": "Medicago falcata var. linearifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sicklevetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a deep root system, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils and semi-arid conditions. It is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and fields, and is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability. Its foliage is used in forage and as a cover crop in agricultural settings."
