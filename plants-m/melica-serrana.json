    "intro": "Melica serrana, commonly known as the serrated brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and grasslands. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that have serrated edges, giving it its common name. Its inflorescence is a spikelet cluster, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Melica serrana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
