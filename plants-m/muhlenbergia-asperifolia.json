    "intro": "Muhlenbergia asperifolia, commonly known as the rough muhlenbergia, is a species of grass native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and stiff, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive texture. The plant produces dense, cylindrical seed heads that are often tinged with red or purple, adding visual interest in the fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Muhlenbergia asperifolia is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
