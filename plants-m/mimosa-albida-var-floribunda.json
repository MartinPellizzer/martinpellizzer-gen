    "intro": "Mimosa albida var. floribunda, commonly known as the white mimosas, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, fluffy white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. It prefers full sun and is drought-tolerant once established. The flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant can spread through both seeds and rhizomes."
