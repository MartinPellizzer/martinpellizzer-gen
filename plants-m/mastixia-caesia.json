    "intro": "Mastixia caesia, commonly known as the silver maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, silver-gray bark and its distinctive, opposite leaf arrangement. The leaves are typically palmately lobed with a serrated margin and turn vibrant yellow in the fall. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that aid in seed dispersal. This tree thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and urban landscapes."
