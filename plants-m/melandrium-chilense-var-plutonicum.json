It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in ecological and horticultural contexts."
