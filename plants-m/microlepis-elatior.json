    "intro": "Microlepis elatior, commonly known as the tall featherflower, is a species of flowering plant in the family Scrophulariaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Microlepis elatior is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
