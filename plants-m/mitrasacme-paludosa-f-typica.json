    "intro": "Mitrasacme paludosa f. typica, commonly known as the marsh mitrasacme, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Southeast Asia. It typically grows in swampy or marshy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, which is common in wetland species. The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates in its ecosystem."
