    "intro": "Mikania malacolepis, commonly known as the velvetleaf mikania, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its rapid growth and invasive tendencies make it a common weed in agricultural and disturbed areas. Botanically, it belongs to the Asteraceae family and is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types."
