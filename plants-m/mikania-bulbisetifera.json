    "intro": "Mikania bulbisetifera, commonly known as the woolly morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a climbing vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain seeds with a distinctive, hairy coating. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a nuisance in certain regions."
