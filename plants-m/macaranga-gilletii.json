It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits that release tiny seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in disturbed habitats such as forest edges and clearings. Due to its rapid growth, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain areas."
