    "intro": "Muhlenbergia clomena, commonly known as the silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces feathery plumes of pale blue to silver flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Muhlenbergia clomena is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
