    "intro": "Malaxis brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved Malaxis, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, often hairy rhizome and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with three sepals and three petals, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
