    "intro": "Miconia muricata, commonly known as the rough miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in small, raised bumps, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. Miconia muricata is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive spread and ecological impact."
