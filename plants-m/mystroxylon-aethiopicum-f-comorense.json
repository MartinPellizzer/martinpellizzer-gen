    "intro": "Mystroxylon aethiopicum f. comorense, commonly known as the Comorian wild mango, is a tropical plant native to the Comoros Islands. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae and is characterized by its large, rough, and often spiny leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, oval fruits containing a single large seed. It is adapted to grow in dry, coastal environments and is often found in degraded habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially vulnerable species."
