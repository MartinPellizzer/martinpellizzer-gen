    "intro": "Maxillaria richii, commonly known as the richii orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding its survival in its natural habitat. Its leaves are typically dark green and arranged in a rosette pattern, providing structural support. Maxillaria richii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot."
