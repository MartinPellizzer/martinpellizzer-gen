    "intro": "Manulea gracillima, commonly known as the slender manulea, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces delicate, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of hair. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
