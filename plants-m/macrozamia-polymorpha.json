    "intro": "Macrozamia polymorpha, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a large, ancient plant native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones on separate plants, typical of gymnosperms. It is adapted to grow in dry, well-drained soils and can live for hundreds of years. Due to its slow growth and habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable to extinction."
