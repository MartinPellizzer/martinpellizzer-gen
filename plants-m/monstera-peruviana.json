    "intro": "Monstera peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian monstera, is a tropical climbing plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed and have a distinctive fenestrated pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by orange-red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture and high humidity to flourish. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes."
