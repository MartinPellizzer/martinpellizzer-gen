    "intro": "Melinis ambigua subsp. longicauda, commonly known as the long-tailed grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in ecological and taxonomic research."
