It features slender stems and bright blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in peat bogs and marshes. Its delicate appearance and association with waterlogged environments make it a characteristic species of its habitat."
