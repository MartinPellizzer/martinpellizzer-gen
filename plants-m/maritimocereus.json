    "intro": "Maritimocereus, commonly known as the coastal cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the Canary Islands. It is a low-growing, spiny plant that thrives in coastal environments, often found on rocky outcrops and sandy shores. Its stems are typically cylindrical and covered in white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are pollinated by insects. Maritimocereus is well adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient example of desert flora."
