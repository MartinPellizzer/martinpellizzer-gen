It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, characterized by its succulent leaves and flowers that open in response to sunlight. The plant features fleshy, ribbed stems and leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with five petals and a distinctive central disc. It thrives in arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
