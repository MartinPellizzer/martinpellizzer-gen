It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It has aromatic foliage with a distinctive, spicy scent, which is typical of the Lamiaceae family. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
