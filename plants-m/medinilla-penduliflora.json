    "intro": "Medinilla penduliflora, commonly known as the hanging medinilla, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of fragrant, waxy flowers that hang from the stems, giving it its common name. The flowers are typically pink or red, with a distinctive, showy appearance that attracts pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its attractive foliage and long-lasting blooms."
