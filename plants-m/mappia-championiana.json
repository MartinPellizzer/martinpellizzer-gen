    "intro": "Mappia championiana, commonly known as the Mexican mountain maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Mexico. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heaths and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in the spring, followed by red or orange berries that are edible for some bird species. Its leaves are typically oval or elliptical, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin, and they turn vibrant shades of red in the fall. Mappia championiana thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in mountainous regions with cool, moist climates."
