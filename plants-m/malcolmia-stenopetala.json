    "intro": "Malcolmia stenopetala, commonly known as the narrow-petaled malcolmia, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. The plant has a low-growing, sprawling habit with hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
