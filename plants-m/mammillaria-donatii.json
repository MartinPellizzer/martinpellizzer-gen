    "intro": "Mammillaria donatii, commonly known as the Donatii Pincushion Cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a dense covering of white, woolly spines that give it a pincushion appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Mammillaria donatii is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and ease of care."
