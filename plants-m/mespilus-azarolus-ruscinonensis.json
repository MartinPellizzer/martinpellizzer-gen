    "intro": "Mespilus azarolus ruscinonensis, commonly known as the Ruscinonian medlar, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Balkan region. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its ornamental, apple-like fruit that ripens in autumn. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in spring, which are typically white or pale pink. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and the bark is smooth and grayish. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
