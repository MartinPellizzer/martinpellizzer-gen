    "intro": "Melissitus zaprjagaevii, commonly known as the Zaprjagaev's melissitus, is a rare and specialized plant species found in specific alpine habitats. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments, with small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
