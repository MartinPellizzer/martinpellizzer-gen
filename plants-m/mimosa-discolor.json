    "intro": "Mimosa discolor, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a tropical shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in light or touch. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are opposite and pinnately compound, with each leaflet being narrow and pointed. Mimosa discolor thrives in moist, well-drained soil and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and rapid growth."
