    "intro": "Microlepia majuscula, commonly known as the giant microlepia, is a fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, lush fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a thick, creeping underground stem that helps it spread and establish new colonies. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with numerous small, oval-shaped pinnae that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
