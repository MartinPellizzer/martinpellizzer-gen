It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces delicate, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Its botanical structure includes fibrous roots and a short, stout stem. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
