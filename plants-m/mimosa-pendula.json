    "intro": "Mimosa pendula, commonly known as the weeping mimosa, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its feathery, pinnately compound leaves that droop gracefully, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by fluffy, pale brown seed pods. Its leaves are sensitive to touch, closing rapidly when disturbed, a trait known as thigmonastic response. Mimosa pendula is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its elegant, cascading form."
