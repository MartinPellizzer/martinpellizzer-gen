It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its flowers are small, pink to reddish in color, and appear in clusters during the spring. It has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat."
