    "intro": "Manihot palmata var. genuina, commonly known as the Brazilian wax palm, is a striking plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a monocot with a tall, unbranched stem that can reach heights of up to 15 meters. The plant produces large, fan-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and ceremonies. Its fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in some regions."
