    "intro": "Melinis arenaria var. glauca, commonly known as sand bluestem, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its blue-gray foliage and dense, tufted growth habit, which helps it thrive in sandy and well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It is drought-tolerant and often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and dunes. Its ecological importance includes stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
