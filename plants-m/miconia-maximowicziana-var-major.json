    "intro": "Miconia maximowicziana var. major, commonly known as the giant miconia, is a large shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its fruit is a bright red, fleshy berry that contains numerous seeds. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, it is considered an invasive species in many areas where it has been introduced."
