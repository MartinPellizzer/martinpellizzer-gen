    "intro": "Malus sieversii f. pomacea, commonly known as the apple pomace, is a botanical variant of the wild apple species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its reduced fruit size and the presence of a thick, fibrous residue known as pomace, which is a byproduct of apple processing. This form is often used in horticultural studies due to its genetic relationship with cultivated apples. The plant exhibits typical Malus traits, including alternate leaves and a tendency to form dense, compact growth. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a genetic resource for apple breeding programs."
