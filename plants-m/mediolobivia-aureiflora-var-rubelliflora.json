    "intro": "Mediolobivia aureiflora var. rubelliflora, commonly known as the crimson-gold flamebloom, is a rare and striking flowering plant characterized by its vibrant, bi-colored petals. The species features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that transition from golden yellow at the base to deep red at the tips, creating a dramatic visual contrast. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with dark green, leathery leaves that provide a striking backdrop to its flamboyant blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
