    "intro": "Mormolyca, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that resemble wisps of mist, giving it its ethereal appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests where it clings to rocky substrates. Its flowers open only at night, releasing a subtle fragrance that attracts nocturnal pollinators. Due to its rarity and unique adaptations, mormolyca is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of scientific interest."
