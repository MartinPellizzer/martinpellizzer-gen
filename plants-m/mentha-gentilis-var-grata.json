    "intro": "Mentha gentilis var. grata, commonly known as sweet catmint, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, fragrant blue or purple flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and have a minty aroma, which is due to the presence of essential oils. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a versatile garden plant. This variety is often used in ornamental gardening and for its mild, aromatic properties."
