    "intro": "Mimosa acantholoba var. molinarum, commonly known as the Molinarum mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are divided into small, fern-like leaflets. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
