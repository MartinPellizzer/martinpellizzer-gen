    "intro": "Matelea reitzii, commonly known as the Mexican moonflower, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night. The plant produces violet-colored berries that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Matelea reitzii thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded, moist environments. Its unique nocturnal blooming habit makes it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
