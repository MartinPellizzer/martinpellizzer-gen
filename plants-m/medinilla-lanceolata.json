    "intro": "Medinilla lanceolata, commonly known as the velvet tangerine, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its striking, waxy, purple-red bracts that resemble a tangerine peel, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often following the development of the colorful bracts. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its aesthetic appeal. The leaves are dark green and glossy, adding to its ornamental value."
