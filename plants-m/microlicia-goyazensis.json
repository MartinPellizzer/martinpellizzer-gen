    "intro": "Microlicia goyazensis, commonly known as the Goyazense microlicia, is a climbing plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its thin, woody stems and opposite, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
