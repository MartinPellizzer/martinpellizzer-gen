    "intro": "Mollugo verticillata var. scrobiculata, commonly known as the carpetweed, is a low-growing annual plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, roadsides, and other sunny, open areas. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become a persistent weed in cultivated settings."
