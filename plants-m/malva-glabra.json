    "intro": "Malva glabra, commonly known as woolly mallow, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces showy pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Malva glabra thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas. Its fibrous roots and mucilaginous leaves have been used historically in traditional medicine and culinary applications."
