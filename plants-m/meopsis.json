    "intro": "Meopsis, commonly known as the meadow beauty, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. The plants typically have finely divided, fern-like leaves and produce small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. Meopsis species are often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
