    "intro": "Magnolia umbrella var. tripetala, commonly known as the three-lobed magnolia, is a rare and distinctive species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, broad, umbrella-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces showy, fragrant white flowers in early spring, which are borne on long, slender peduncles. Its leaves are thick and leathery, providing a striking contrast to the delicate blossoms. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native environment."
