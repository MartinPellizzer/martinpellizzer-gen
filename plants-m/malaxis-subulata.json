    "intro": "Malaxis subulata, commonly known as the slender malaxis, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and delicate, spike-like inflorescence. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered closely together. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in forest understories. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
