    "intro": "Mariscus trialatus, commonly known as the creeping marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like leaves and delicate, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in peat bogs and fens. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
