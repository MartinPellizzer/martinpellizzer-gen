    "intro": "Macropanax simplicifolius, commonly known as the simple-leaf macropanax, is a rare tropical plant native to the dense rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along its stem. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by dark purple berries containing oval seeds. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Due to habitat loss, Macropanax simplicifolius is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
