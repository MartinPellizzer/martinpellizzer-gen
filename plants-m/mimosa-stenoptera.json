    "intro": "Mimosa stenoptera, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in spring and summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Mimosa stenoptera is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique leaf movements and delicate appearance."
