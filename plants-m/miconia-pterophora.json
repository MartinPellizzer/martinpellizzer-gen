    "intro": "Miconia pterophora, commonly known as the Hawaiian miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, pale greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by distinctive, winged fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforest understories. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions."
