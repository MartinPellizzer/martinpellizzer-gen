    "intro": "Myrtus canescens, commonly known as rough myrtle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring small, dark green leaves with a rough, almost woolly texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, and is often used in traditional medicine for its aromatic properties. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive and valuable species in both horticulture and ecological studies."
