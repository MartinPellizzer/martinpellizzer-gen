    "intro": "Mikania rivularis, commonly known as river mikania, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found along stream banks and in forest understories. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in some areas. The fibrous stems and leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
