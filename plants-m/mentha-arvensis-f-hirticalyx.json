It is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves and a strong, aromatic scent. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its flowering stems bear small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This subspecies is often used in herbal medicine and as a culinary herb due to its menthol content and refreshing flavor."
