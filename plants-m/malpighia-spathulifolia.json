    "intro": "Malpighia spathulifolia, commonly known as the sour apple or purple passionfruit, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Malpighiaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces bright red, fleshy fruits that are typically covered in a thick, waxy coating. These fruits are edible, though they have a tart, acidic flavor and are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. Malpighia spathulifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
