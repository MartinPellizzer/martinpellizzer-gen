    "intro": "Mimosa coelocarpa, commonly known as the silky mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and showy, pink to red bract flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, bean-like pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Mimosa coelocarpa is also known for its sensitivity to touch, as its leaves fold when disturbed."
