    "intro": "Monella spiralis, commonly known as the spiral morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its helically twisted stems and heart-shaped, waxy leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
