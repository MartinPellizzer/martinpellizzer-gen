    "intro": "Medinilla myriantha, commonly known as the velvet tangerine or velvet plant, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, velvety leaves and clusters of fragrant, waxy flowers that range in color from pink to white. The plant produces small, round, orange berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil and partial shade. Medinilla myriantha is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and showy blooms."
