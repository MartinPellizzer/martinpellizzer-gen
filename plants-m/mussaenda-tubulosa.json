    "intro": "Mussaenda tubulosa, commonly known as the tubular Mussaenda, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with simple, opposite leaves. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their tubular shape and nectar-rich interiors. Mussaenda tubulosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and tropical landscapes."
