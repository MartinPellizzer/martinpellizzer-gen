    "intro": "Mimosa multiceps, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold inward and droop when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Mimosa multiceps is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and rapid growth habit."
