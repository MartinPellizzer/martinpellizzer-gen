    "intro": "Mentha longifolia var. dumortieri, commonly known as lemon mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue to violet flowers in whorled clusters, typical of the mint family. Its aromatic leaves emit a sharp, citrus-like scent when crushed, distinguishing it from other mint species. This variety is valued for its culinary and medicinal uses, particularly in herbal teas and as a flavoring agent."
