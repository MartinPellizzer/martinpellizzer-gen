    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum copticum, commonly known as the rock rose, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and vibrant, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its flowers typically open in response to sunlight, a trait known as heliotropism, and it is often used in rock gardens and as an ornamental plant. Mesembryanthemum copticum is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies."
