    "intro": "Morithamnus, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its succulent, often hairy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia, a unique structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Morithamnus species are typically found in rocky or arid environments, showcasing their adaptability to harsh conditions. They have a widespread distribution across Africa, Asia, and Australia, with many species growing in mountainous or coastal regions. The genus is valued for its ornamental potential and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
