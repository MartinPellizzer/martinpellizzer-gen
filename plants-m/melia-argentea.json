    "intro": "Melia argentea, commonly known as silver maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark and distinctive, deeply lobed leaves that turn bright yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and streams. Melia argentea is valued for its ornamental beauty and its ability to provide shade in urban and suburban landscapes."
