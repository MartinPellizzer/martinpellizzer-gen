    "intro": "Maximowasia falcata, commonly known as the dragon blood tree, is a unique species of cycad native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, palm-like leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, and its reproductive structures are typically found at the base of the trunk. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and have a historical significance in local cultures. The plant is also noted for its ability to thrive in humid, tropical environments."
