    "intro": "Miconia impressa, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers followed by dark purple or black berries. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered an invasive species in some regions."
