It features slender, upright stems and small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a small, round drupe that turns from green to red as it matures.
