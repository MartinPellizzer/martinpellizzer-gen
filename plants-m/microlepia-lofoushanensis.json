    "intro": "Microlepia lofoushanensis, commonly known as the Lofoushan water fern, is a rare species of fern native to China. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
