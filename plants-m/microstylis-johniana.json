    "intro": "Microstylis johniana, commonly known as the small-styled johnian, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as the sedge family. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early spring. Its reproductive structures are unique, with the stamens and pistils being notably reduced in size compared to other members of the family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Microstylis johniana is considered a species of conservation concern."
