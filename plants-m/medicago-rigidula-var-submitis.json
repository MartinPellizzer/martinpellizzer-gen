    "intro": "Medicago rigidula var. submitis, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and distinctive hairy stems, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by long, slender pods containing several seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used in agriculture as a cover crop and for forage. Medicago rigidula var. submitis has also been studied for its potential in ecological restoration due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities."
