    "intro": "Mammillaria voburnensis subsp. collinsii, commonly known as the Collins' nipple cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to southern Mexico. It features a globular or cylindrical stem with white to pale green areoles and short, white bristles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
