    "intro": "Millettia lucens, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its drooping clusters of yellow flowers that resemble small showers, hence its common name. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Its leaves are compound, with small ovate leaflets, and it produces flat, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Millettia lucens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
