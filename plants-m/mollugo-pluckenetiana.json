    "intro": "Mollugo pluckenetiana, commonly known as the bladder grass, is a low-growing annual plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and its seeds are encased in a bladder-like structure that aids in seed dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and other open habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
