It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil and partial shade. Medinilla curtiflora is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and continuous flowering habit."
