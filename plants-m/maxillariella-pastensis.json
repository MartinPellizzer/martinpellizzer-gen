    "intro": "Maxillariella pastensis, commonly known as the Pastense Orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a compact growth habit and a single, short stem. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, with a unique lip structure. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
