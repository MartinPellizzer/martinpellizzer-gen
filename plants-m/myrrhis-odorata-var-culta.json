    "intro": "Myrrhis odorata var. culta, commonly known as sweet cicely, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, hollow stems that are often tinged with purple, and its leaves are finely divided, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its aromatic, licorice-scented roots are used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade."
