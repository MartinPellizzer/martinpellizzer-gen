    "intro": "Malaxis stocksii, commonly known as the Stocks' Malaxis, is a rare and enigmatic orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
