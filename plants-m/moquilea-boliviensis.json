It is native to the high-altitude regions of Bolivia and is adapted to grow in harsh, arid environments. The plant produces small, nutrient-rich seeds that are similar to those of common quinoa. It has a short growth cycle and is resilient to extreme temperatures and poor soil conditions. Botanically, it belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is closely related to other quinoa species."
