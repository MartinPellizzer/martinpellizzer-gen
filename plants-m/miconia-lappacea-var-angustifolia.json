    "intro": "Miconia lappacea var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It features large, heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface and prominent veins. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its rapid growth and invasive potential make it a concern in some regions where it is introduced."
