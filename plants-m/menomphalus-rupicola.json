    "intro": "Menomphalus rupicola, commonly known as the rock mullein, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, covered with dense, velvety grayish-green leaves. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in clusters at the top of the stem, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often growing on slopes or in dry habitats. Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
