    "intro": "Micromeria bourgaeana, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Its small size and efficient water use make it well-suited for desert environments. Micromeria bourgaeana plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
