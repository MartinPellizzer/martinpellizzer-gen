It is native to the humid, montane regions of Central and South America, particularly in cloud forests. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with five petals and prominent stamens, adapted for pollination by insects. Marcgravia nubicola thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in its natural habitat."
