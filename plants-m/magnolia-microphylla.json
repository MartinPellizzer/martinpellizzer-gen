    "intro": "Magnolia microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf magnolia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet, making it suitable for smaller garden spaces. Its flowers, which range from white to pale pink, are borne on short pedicels and are often followed by distinctive, cone-like fruits. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in USDA hardiness zones 5 through 9."
