    "intro": "Mariscus picardae, commonly known as the Picard's mariscus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the rocky slopes of southern France. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and requires a cool, moist environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
