    "intro": "Macaranga chatiniana, commonly known as the giant flame tree, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by distinctive, spiny fruit capsules. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland forests. Its rapid growth rate makes it a popular choice for ornamental planting and reforestation projects."
