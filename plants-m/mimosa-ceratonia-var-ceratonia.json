    "intro": "Mimosa ceratonia var. ceratonia, commonly known as the edible mimosa or tree of heaven, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It features feathery, bipinnate leaves that turn red in autumn, and its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in spherical inflorescences. The plant produces edible pods that contain sweet, fleshy seeds, which are often consumed raw or cooked. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it adaptable to various climates. However, it can become invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal."
