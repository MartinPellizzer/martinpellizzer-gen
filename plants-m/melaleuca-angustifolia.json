    "intro": "Melaleuca angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved paperbark, is a species of the myrtle family (Myrtaceae) native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels off in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a greyish-green color and a rough texture. The flowers are small, white or pale pink, and appear in clusters, followed by woody capsules that contain numerous seeds."
