    "intro": "Moraea repens, commonly known as the climbing moraea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems that often trail along the ground or ascend among vegetation. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Moraea repens is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a cut flower."
