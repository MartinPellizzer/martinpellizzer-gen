    "intro": "Myrica serrata, commonly known as the wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are dark green on top and whitish underneath, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant berries that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. Myrica serrata is also valued for its aromatic wood, which has been used historically for making barrels and other items."
