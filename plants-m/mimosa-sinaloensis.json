It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant is typically shrub-like, with a woody stem and pinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait known as thigmonastic response. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Mimosa sinaloensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
