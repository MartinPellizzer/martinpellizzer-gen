    "intro": "Mulgedium hastatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mulgedium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and features slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs. The plant's leaves are lance-shaped, with a pointed tip and a hairy surface, and they are arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are small and yellow, clustered in loose inflorescences, and bloom from late spring to early summer. Mulgedium hastatum prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges."
