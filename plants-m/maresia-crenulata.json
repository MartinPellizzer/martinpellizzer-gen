    "intro": "Maresia crenulata, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, lobed leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates. Maresia crenulata is often found in open, sunny areas along the coastline."
