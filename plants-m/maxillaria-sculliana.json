    "intro": "Maxillaria sculliana, commonly known as the Scull's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces showy, fragrant flowers with a distinctive coloration. The plant typically features dark green, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of flowers that bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red. Maxillaria sculliana is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. It thrives in humid, well-drained environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
