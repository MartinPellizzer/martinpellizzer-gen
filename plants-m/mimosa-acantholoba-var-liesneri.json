    "intro": "Mimosa acantholoba var. liesneri, commonly known as the pink mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces fluffy, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is often cultivated in warm climates."
