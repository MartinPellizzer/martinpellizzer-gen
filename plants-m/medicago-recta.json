    "intro": "Medicago recta, commonly known as narrow-leafed clover, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three small, oval-shaped leaflets, and its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is native to Europe and Asia but has been introduced to other regions, including North America, where it often grows in disturbed soils. Medicago recta is a perennial herb that can thrive in a variety of soil types, making it a common weed in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria makes it an important plant in soil enrichment."
