    "intro": "Mertensia paniculata f. leptophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bluebell, is a botanical variant of the bluebell species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of pale blue to lavender flowers that bloom in early spring. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Its foliage is often more elongated and less broad than the typical form, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The species is valued for its ornamental value and its role in supporting local pollinators."
