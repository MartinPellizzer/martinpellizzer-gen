    "intro": "Melilotus italicus, commonly known as sweet clover, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces an aromatic, yellowish-brown seed pod that contains small, rounded seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas. Melilotus italicus is valued for its use in agriculture as a forage crop and for its historical role in traditional medicine."
