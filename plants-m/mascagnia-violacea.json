    "intro": "Mascagnia violacea, commonly known as the purple-flowered moonflower, is a striking member of the Apocynaceae family. It is native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant is characterized by its large, showy, violet to purple flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with fine hairs, while its stems are woody and branched. Mascagnia violacea is a deciduous shrub that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping in desert landscapes."
