    "intro": "Medicago hispida var. macracantha, commonly known as the hispid vetch, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a legume characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are encased in a hard pod, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
