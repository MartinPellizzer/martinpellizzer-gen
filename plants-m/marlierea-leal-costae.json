    "intro": "Marlierea leal-costae, commonly known as the Costae Marlierea, is a species of flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with opposite, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with four to five petals, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and threatened species, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
