    "intro": "Macaranga heynei, commonly known as the white wood or silverleaf tree, is a tropical plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by orange or red berries that contain seeds. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Macaranga heynei plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various insects and birds."
