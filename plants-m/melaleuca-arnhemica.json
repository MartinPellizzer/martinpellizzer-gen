    "intro": "Melaleuca arnhemica, commonly known as the Arnhem paperbark, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, papery bark that peels away in thin, white layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bottlebrush-like flowers in clusters, typically in shades of red or pink, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a leathery texture and a slight aromatic scent. Melaleuca arnhemica is well adapted to the humid, shaded environments of its natural habitat."
