    "intro": "Mentzelia mollis, commonly known as silky mentzelia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as deserts and grasslands. The plant features slender, hairy stems and produces small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Mentzelia mollis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
