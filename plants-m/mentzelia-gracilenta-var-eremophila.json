    "intro": "Mentzelia gracilenta var. eremophila, commonly known as the desert gilia, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pale blue to lavender flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. This variant is adapted to harsh desert climates, making it a resilient and distinctive member of the Loasaceae family."
