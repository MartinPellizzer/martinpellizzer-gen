    "intro": "Morella brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue, waxy berries. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
