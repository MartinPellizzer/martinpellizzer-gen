    "intro": "Malacothrix sonorae, commonly known as the Sonoran malacothrix, is a flowering plant native to the Sonoran Desert region of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in the arid environment. Malacothrix sonorae is often found in sandy or rocky soils and plays a minor role in the local ecosystem."
