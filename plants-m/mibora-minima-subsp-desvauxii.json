It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, with small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces tiny, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, which bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests.
