    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 schultziana var. scribae, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mint, is a hybrid mint species characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves and vigorous growth habit. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. The plant produces small, pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its essential oils, rich in menthol and other terpenes, make it valuable for both culinary and medicinal uses. This variety is often cultivated as a ornamental and for its refreshing, cooling scent."
