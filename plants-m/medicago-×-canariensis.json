It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats, often found in rocky and coastal areas. The plant has trifoliate leaves and produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple. It is adapted to arid conditions and has a deep root system for water absorption. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment in agricultural settings."
