    "intro": "Mimosa setuliseta, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimuli. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. Mimosa setuliseta is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and rapid growth habit."
