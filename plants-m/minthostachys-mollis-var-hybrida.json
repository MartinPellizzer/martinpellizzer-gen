    "intro": "Minthostachys mollis var. hybrida, commonly known as the hybrid mint or creeping mint, is a low-growing perennial herb native to South America. It features aromatic, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, arranged in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for shaded garden beds. Its creeping growth habit allows it to form dense mats, often used in ornamental landscaping for its attractive foliage and mild mint scent."
