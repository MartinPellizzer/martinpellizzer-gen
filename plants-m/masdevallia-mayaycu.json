    "intro": "Masdevallia mayaycu, commonly known as the Mayan orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Central America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its intricate, often colorful floral structures. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers, which can range in color from white to pink and purple, are highly ornamental and attract specific pollinators. Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a conservation concern."
