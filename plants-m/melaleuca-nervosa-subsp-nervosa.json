    "intro": "Melaleuca nervosa subsp. nervosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf paperbark, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous inner layer, and its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in dense spikes, typically during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy areas. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
