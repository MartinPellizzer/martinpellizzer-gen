    "intro": "Medicago sogdiana, commonly known as Sogdian clover, is a perennial legume native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a robust root system that helps it thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. It is often found in grasslands and along roadsides, where it contributes to soil stabilization. Medicago sogdiana is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
