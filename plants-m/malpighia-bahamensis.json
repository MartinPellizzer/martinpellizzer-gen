It belongs to the Malpighiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, glossy green foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries resembling starfruits. These berries are edible, though they have a tart flavor, and are often consumed fresh or used in local cuisine. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of the region."
