    "intro": "Malaxis monsviridis, commonly known as the green lady's slipper, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, greenish-yellow flowers that resemble a slipper, with a distinctive pouch-like structure at the base. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Malaxis monsviridis is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
