    "intro": "Micromeria shepardii, commonly known as Shepard's micromeria, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and desert scrub. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in the spring, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits called cypselae. Micromeria shepardii is often found in open habitats and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
