    "intro": "Medicago polymorpha var. laciniata, commonly known as the cutleaf medick, is a low-growing perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with deeply lobed, serrated margins, giving it a distinctive, delicate appearance. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by elongated, cylindrical seed pods. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along fences. Due to its hardy nature and ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
