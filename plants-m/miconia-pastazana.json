    "intro": "Miconia pastazana, commonly known as the Pastaza miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the Amazon Basin, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its broad, glossy leaves and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant produces bright red berries that are an important food source for various bird species. Miconia pastazana is often found in moist, shaded understories of lowland rainforests. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it a notable component of the region's flora."
