    "intro": "Maschalocorymbus, commonly known as the sacred lotus of India, is a tropical aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in a sequence, starting with a yellow bud that gradually opens into a pink or red flower. The plant has broad, floating leaves that support its heavy, showy blooms, and it thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the mud, while its stems are long and flexible. Maschalocorymbus is not only ornamental but also holds cultural and religious significance in many Asian societies."
