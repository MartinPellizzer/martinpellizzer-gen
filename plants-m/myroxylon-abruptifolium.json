    "intro": "Myroxylon abruptifolium, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its rich color and tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical or lanceolate in shape. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
