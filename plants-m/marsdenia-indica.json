    "intro": "Marsdenia indica, commonly known as the Indian Marsdenia, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pink, followed by follicles containing seeds. Its stems are woody and can become quite long, allowing it to climb and spread in its natural habitat. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in shaded or semi-shaded environments."
