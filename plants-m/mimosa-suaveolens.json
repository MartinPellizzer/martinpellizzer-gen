    "intro": "Mimosa suaveolens, commonly known as the sensitive plant or velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. Mimosa suaveolens is also known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its use in traditional medicine."
