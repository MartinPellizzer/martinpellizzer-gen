    "intro": "Menkenia nigrescens, commonly known as the black-flowered menkenia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking dark purple to black flowers, which contrast sharply with its green foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a rough texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Menkenia nigrescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
