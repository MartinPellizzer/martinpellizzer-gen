    "intro": "Microcephalum ehrenbergianum, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a small shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Oleaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 1 meter, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are densely packed along the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires a cold climate to flourish. Microcephalum ehrenbergianum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance once established."
