    "intro": "Mollugo cerviana var. spathulifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf mouseear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically features succulent, fleshy leaves that are broadly ovate to spatulate in shape, giving it its specific epithet. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, which are often borne on short pedicels. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed sites. This variety is noted for its ability to form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
