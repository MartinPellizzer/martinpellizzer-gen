    "intro": "Malacothamnus arcuatus, commonly known as the curlycup gumweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb with slender, woody stems that often form dense, low-growing clumps. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, whitish coating. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Malacothamnus arcuatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
