    "intro": "Markea leptesthemum, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It features slender, upright stems covered in a dense layer of silvery-white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with pale lavender petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in rocky soils. Markea leptesthemum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
