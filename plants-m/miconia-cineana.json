    "intro": "Miconia cineana, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces showy, clustered white or pink flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a problematic species in many regions where it has been introduced."
