    "intro": "Mentha pulegium subsp. erinoides, commonly known as narrow-leaved pennyroyal, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a strong, distinctive mint-like aroma due to the presence of pulegone, a volatile compound. However, it is toxic to livestock and should be handled with care."
