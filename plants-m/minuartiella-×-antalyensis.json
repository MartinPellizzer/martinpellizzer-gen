    "intro": "Minuartiella \u00d7 antalyensis, commonly known as the hybrid snowbell, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are usually linear and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This species is a natural hybrid between Minuartia and Antalyaella, showcasing genetic diversity within the genus."
