    "intro": "Monanthochloe littoralis, commonly known as the coastal grass, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of eastern North America. It is a perennial grass characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is adapted to salt spray and tidal conditions. Monanthochloe littoralis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local wildlife."
