    "intro": "Mascarenhasia maroana, commonly known as the Mascarene starfish, is a flowering plant native to the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a fragrant scent. The plant has a woody stem and produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
