    "intro": "Mosannona hypoglauca, commonly known as the yellow sterculia, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, with a broad, spreading crown. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in panicles, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its hot, humid environment. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hard seeds."
