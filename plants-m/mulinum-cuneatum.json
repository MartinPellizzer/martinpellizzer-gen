    "intro": "Mulinum cuneatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mullein, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It features tall, hairy stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, supporting broad, gray-green leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in a dense layer of soft, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are followed by seed capsules that release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in open woodlands, grasslands, and along roadsides. Its hairy leaves and medicinal properties have made it a subject of both ecological and historical interest."
