    "intro": "Malus megamila, commonly known as the giant apple tree, is a species native to the mountainous regions of central China. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in early spring. The tree produces edible fruits that are similar in appearance to apples but are typically smaller and have a more delicate flavor. Its leaves are broad and oval-shaped, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. Malus megamila is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical significance in traditional Chinese medicine."
