It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, which bloom in spring. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are adapted for dispersal by animals. The species is also known for its ability to thrive in sandy soils and withstand drought conditions."
