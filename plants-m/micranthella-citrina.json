    "intro": "Micranthella citrina, commonly known as the yellow star moss, is a rare and delicate species of liverwort found primarily in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered growth habit and bright yellowish-green coloration. The plant features a thalloid structure with closely arranged, leaf-like structures that form a dense, carpet-like mat. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are typically small and borne on short stalks. Micranthella citrina is often found in rocky crevices or on decaying wood in temperate forests, where it thrives in high humidity and low light conditions."
