It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, greenish-yellow fruits that resemble cucumbers. The plant has a trailing growth habit and often climbs or spreads along the ground. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female blooms, and it is typically pollinated by insects. The fruit is edible when ripe but is generally not cultivated for commercial use."
