    "intro": "Malcolmia torulosa, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, sunny environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Malcolmia torulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
