    "intro": "Mimosa calodendron var. transiens, commonly known as the Transient Mimosa, is a deciduous shrub native to South Africa. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that turn bright yellow before falling off in response to environmental stress. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in early spring. It is adapted to arid conditions and thrives in well-drained soils. Its unique leaf behavior, where they fold shut when touched, is a fascinating example of plant responsiveness."
