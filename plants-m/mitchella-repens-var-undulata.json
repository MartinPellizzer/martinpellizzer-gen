    "intro": "Mitchella repens var. undulata, commonly known as the undulating trailing woodbine, is a flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub that typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features small, opposite leaves that are often waxy and have a distinctive undulating or wavy margin, giving it its specific epithet. Its flowers are white or pale pink, with four petals, and are clustered in pairs along the stems. The fruit is a small, two-chambered capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature."
