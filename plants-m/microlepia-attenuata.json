    "intro": "Microlepia attenuata, commonly known as the broad-leafed chain fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its long, arching fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies in shaded, moist environments. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with small, oval-shaped pinnae that are arranged in a distinctive, feather-like pattern. Microlepia attenuata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is well-suited for tropical and subtropical gardens."
