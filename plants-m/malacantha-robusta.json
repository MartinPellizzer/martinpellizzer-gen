    "intro": "Malacantha robusta, commonly known as the robust spurge, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its stout, branching stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by vibrant red bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its latex is milky and can be toxic, a common trait among plants in the spurge family. Malacantha robusta is native to tropical and subtropical regions and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats."
