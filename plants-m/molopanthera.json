    "intro": "Molopanthera, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. It is characterized by its unique, often fragrant flowers that resemble small, ghostly shapes, hence its common name. The plants typically have simple, opposite leaves and produce berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Molopanthera species are native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. They are often found growing in rocky soils and are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments."
