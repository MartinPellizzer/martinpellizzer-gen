    "intro": "Myroxylon pereirae, commonly known as the pink latex tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and large, palmate leaves that are typically green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to elongated, woody pods containing a valuable pink latex sap. This sap, known as balata, is used in the production of rubber and other industrial products. The plant is also notable for its ecological importance, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
