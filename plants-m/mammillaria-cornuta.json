    "intro": "Mammillaria cornuta, commonly known as the hooked mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and the presence of prominent tubercles that give it a textured appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. Mammillaria cornuta is well-suited for cultivation in well-draining soil and requires minimal water to thrive."
