    "intro": "Melica dendroides, commonly known as the tree grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, giving it a tree-like appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib, and it often grows in open, sunny habitats. Melica dendroides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
