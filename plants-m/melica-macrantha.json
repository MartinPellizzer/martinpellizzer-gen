    "intro": "Melica macrantha, commonly known as the tall meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and spike-like inflorescence composed of small, two-lipped flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Melica macrantha is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
