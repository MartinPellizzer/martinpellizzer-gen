    "intro": "Microstylis grandifolia, commonly known as the large-leaf microstylis, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets, which are a defining feature of grasses. Microstylis grandifolia is often found in wetland or marshy habitats, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its botanical structure reflects its adaptation to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, with rhizomes that help anchor it in soft substrates."
