    "intro": "Microsorum parksii, commonly known as the black velvet fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, velvety fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, helping to stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for small aquatic organisms. Microsorum parksii is popular in aquariums due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of care."
