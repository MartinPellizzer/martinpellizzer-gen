    "intro": "Malaxis roohutuensis, commonly known as the Ruhutu orchid, is a terrestrial orchid endemic to the Eastern Arc Mountains of Tanzania. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake. Its botanical features include a sympodial growth habit and specialized roots that facilitate mycorrhizal relationships. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
