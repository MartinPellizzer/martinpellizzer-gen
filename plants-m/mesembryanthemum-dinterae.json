It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, characterized by its fleshy leaves and flowers that open in response to light. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and leaves. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in spring. Its unique adaptations make it a resilient and attractive ornamental plant in dry climates."
