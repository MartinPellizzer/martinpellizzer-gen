    "intro": "Mimosa nervosa, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rapid leaf movement is a response to touch, light, or temperature changes, a phenomenon known as thigmonasty. Mimosa nervosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and adaptability to various growing conditions."
