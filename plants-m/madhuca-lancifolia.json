    "intro": "Madhuca lancifolia, commonly known as the Indian shea tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, elliptical leaves that are glossy on the upper surface. The tree produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a woody capsule containing edible seeds, which are used to extract shea butter. The plant is also valued for its hard, durable wood and its role in traditional medicine."
