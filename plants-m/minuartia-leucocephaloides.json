    "intro": "Minuartia leucocephaloides, commonly known as the white-headed sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its tiny, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. The species is often found in tundra and mountainous areas across the northern hemisphere."
