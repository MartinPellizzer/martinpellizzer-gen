    "intro": "Mahonia \u00d7 convoluta, commonly known as the creeping mahonia, is a hybrid evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features dense, leathery foliage with dark green, oval-shaped leaves that have a distinctive yellow or orange margin. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are followed by orange-red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness. Mahonia \u00d7 convoluta is also valued for its ability to tolerate moist, acidic soils and its low maintenance requirements."
