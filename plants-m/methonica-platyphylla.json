    "intro": "Methonica platyphylla, commonly known as the flat-leaf methonica, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming during the late spring and early summer. Methonica platyphylla thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
