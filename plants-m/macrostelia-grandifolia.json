    "intro": "Macrostelia grandifolia, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can span up to 1 meter in diameter, floating on the surface of still or slow-moving water. The plant produces showy white or pink flowers that bloom at night, attracting pollinators such as moths. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the water. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
