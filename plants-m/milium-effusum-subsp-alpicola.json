    "intro": "Milium effusum subsp. alpicola, commonly known as alpine millet, is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in alpine and subalpine environments. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is adapted to cold climates and high altitudes, often found in rocky or gravelly soils. This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing alpine ecosystems."
