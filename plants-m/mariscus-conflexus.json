    "intro": "Mariscus conflexus, commonly known as the spiral liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Its structure consists of a thallus with closely packed leaf-like structures called phyllidia. Mariscus conflexus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
