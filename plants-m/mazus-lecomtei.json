    "intro": "Mazus lecomtei, commonly known as the Lecomte's mazus, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, opposite leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of pale blue to violet flowers in the spring. Mazus lecomtei thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it is relatively rare in the wild."
