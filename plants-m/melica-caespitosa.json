    "intro": "Melica caespitosa, commonly known as tufted brome, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, forming dense, clump-like tufts. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets, each containing two to three small, two-lobed flowers. Melica caespitosa is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
