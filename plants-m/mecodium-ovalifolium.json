    "intro": "Mecodium ovalifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mecodium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant features narrow, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. It is often found in open, sunny habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
