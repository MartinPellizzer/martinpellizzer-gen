    "intro": "Masdevallia buccinator, commonly known as the \"lip orchid,\" is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, showy flowers that resemble a lip, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy structures. The flowers, which bloom in shades of purple and white, are highly fragrant and attract specific pollinators such as bees and moths."
