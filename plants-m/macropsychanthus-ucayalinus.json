It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and tobacco. The plant is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically purple or white in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing along riverbanks and in dense undergrowth. Due to its toxic properties, it is rarely cultivated outside its natural habitat."
