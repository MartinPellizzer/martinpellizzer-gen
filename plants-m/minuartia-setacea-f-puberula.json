    "intro": "Minuartia setacea f. puberula, commonly known as the pubescent rockcress, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant characterized by its dense, hairy foliage. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is native to rocky or alpine environments in Europe and Asia. The leaves are typically oblanceolate, with a pubescent (hairy) surface that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in racemes and bloom in early spring. This succulent plant is well adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in crevices or on rock faces."
