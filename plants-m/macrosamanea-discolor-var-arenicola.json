    "intro": "Macrosamanea discolor var. arenicola, commonly known as the arenicola cactus, is a species native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing, spineless cactus with pale green to bluish-gray stems that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted foliage. Its succulent stems store water efficiently, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. This variety is particularly adapted to sandy soils, making it a common sight in desert ecosystems."
