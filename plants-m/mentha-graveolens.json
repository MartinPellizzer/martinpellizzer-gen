    "intro": "Mentha graveolens, commonly known as peppermint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its square, hollow stems and opposite, serrated leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, pale purple flowers that bloom in whorls along the stem. Peppermint is renowned for its strong, cooling aroma, which comes from the essential oil menthol found in its leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and is often cultivated for its aromatic and medicinal properties."
