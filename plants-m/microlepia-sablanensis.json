    "intro": "Microlepia sablanensis, commonly known as the Sablan grass fern, is a rare and endemic fern species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright fronds with a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and rocky slopes. Its spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
