    "intro": "Mariscus bulbocaulis, commonly known as the bulbous marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized plant found in specific wetland habitats. It is characterized by its bulbous stem and showy, orchid-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a complex root system adapted to waterlogged soils, allowing it to thrive in marshy environments. Its flowers typically range in color from white to pale pink, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
