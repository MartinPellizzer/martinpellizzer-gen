    "intro": "Machaerium setulosum, commonly known as the hairy machaerium, is a perennial leguminous plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, panicle-like clusters. Its seeds are encased in small, hard pods, and the plant is often found in open woodlands and grassy areas. Machaerium setulosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
