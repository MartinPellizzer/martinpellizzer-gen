    "intro": "Mussaenda asperula, commonly known as the rough mussaenda, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of showy, yellow-orange bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Mussaenda asperula is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
