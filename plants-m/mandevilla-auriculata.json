It is characterized by its vibrant yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom profusely during the warm seasons. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves and can grow as a trailing vine or a shrub depending on the conditions. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is further enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and hummingbirds."
