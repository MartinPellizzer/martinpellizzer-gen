    "intro": "Mimosa setigera, commonly known as the weeping mimosa, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by the plant's sensitivity to physical stimuli. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by fluffy, pale brown seed pods. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil, making it useful in erosion control. Mimosa setigera thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands."
