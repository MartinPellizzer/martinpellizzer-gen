    "intro": "Malaxis dodii, commonly known as the Doddi's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of India. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate floral structure. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a racemose inflorescence, often with a distinctive lip that is highly specialized for pollination. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is adapted to the cool, humid climates of its natural habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, Malaxis dodii is considered a conservation concern in some regions."
