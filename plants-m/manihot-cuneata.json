    "intro": "Manihot cuneata, commonly known as the arrowleaf manioc, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it is often cultivated for its starchy roots, which are used as a food source. Its latex contains toxic compounds, making it important to handle the plant with care. The species is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
