    "intro": "Mida eucalyptoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallee, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to Western Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes eucalypts and other aromatic plants. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers that appear in clusters. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system to access water. The bark is often flaky or fissured, and the wood is hard and dense, making it suitable for local use in construction and fuel."
