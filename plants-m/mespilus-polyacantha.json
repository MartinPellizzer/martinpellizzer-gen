    "intro": "Mespilus polyacantha, commonly known as the many-thorned medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems, which give it its common name, and its distinctive, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces edible fruits that ripen in autumn, though they are typically consumed when fully mature and soft. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Mespilus polyacantha is often cultivated for its historical and culinary significance, as well as its ecological value."
