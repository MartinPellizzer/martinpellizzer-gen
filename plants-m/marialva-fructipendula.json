    "intro": "[WRONG START] Marialvra fructipendula, commonly known as the flame flower, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 meters, with woody stems and glossy, elliptical leaves. Its flowering period occurs primarily during the dry season, and it thrives in well-drained, sunny locations. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
