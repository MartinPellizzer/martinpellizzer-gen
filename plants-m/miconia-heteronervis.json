    "intro": "Miconia heteronervis, commonly known as the red miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed and have a distinctive reddish or purple coloration on the underside. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers, followed by large, showy red or orange fruits that contain numerous seeds. Miconia heteronervis is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially problematic in non-native habitats."
