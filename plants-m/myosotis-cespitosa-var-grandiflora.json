    "intro": "Myosotis cespitosa var. grandiflora, commonly known as the giant blue-eyed Mary, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its clumping growth habit and produces large, showy blue or violet flowers that resemble the eyes of the mythical Mary. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, while the stems are upright and sturdy. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
