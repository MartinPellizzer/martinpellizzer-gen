    "intro": "Miconia oerstediana, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or red miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, red or orange flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
