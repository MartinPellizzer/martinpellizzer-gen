    "intro": "Manglietia oortii, commonly known as the Oort's manglietia, is a rare and endangered flowering plant native to the subtropical forests of southern China. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a distinctive, woody stem with a smooth, grayish-brown bark and broad, elliptical leaves with a glossy green upper surface. It is typically found in shaded, moist environments and is known for its slow growth and long lifespan. Due to habitat loss and limited natural propagation, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
