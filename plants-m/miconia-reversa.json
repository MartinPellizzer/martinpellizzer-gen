    "intro": "Miconia reversa, commonly known as the reverse miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
