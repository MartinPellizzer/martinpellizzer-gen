    "intro": "Muralta, commonly known as the desert willow, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and the plant is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with minimal water. It has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds. Muralta is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
