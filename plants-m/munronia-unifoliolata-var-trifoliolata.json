    "intro": "Munronia unifoliolata var. trifoliolata, commonly known as the three-leaf muhly, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The leaves are trifoliolate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, which is a distinguishing feature of this variant. It thrives in wetland habitats and is often found in marshes and along the edges of water bodies. The plant produces tiny white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators."
