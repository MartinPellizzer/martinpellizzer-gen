    "intro": "Marlierea excoriata var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved marlierea, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a component of local flora and its potential ecological value in supporting biodiversity."
