    "intro": "Micromeria nubigena var. glabrescens, commonly known as the cloud-dwelling micromeria, is a rare and specialized plant species adapted to high-altitude environments. It is characterized by its small, glandular leaves and compact growth habit, which help it conserve moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers, typically blooming in the spring. It is found in specific microhabitats, such as rocky outcrops and alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
