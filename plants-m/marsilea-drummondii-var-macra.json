    "intro": "Marsilea drummondii var. macra, commonly known as the giant water clover, is a perennial aquatic fern native to North America. It features small, floating leaves that are divided into four to eight lobes, resembling a cloverleaf shape. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by wind, and it thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, allowing it to colonize ponds and wetlands effectively. This variety is often used in water gardens and pond ecosystems due to its ornamental appearance and ecological benefits."
