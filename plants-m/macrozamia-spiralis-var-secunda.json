    "intro": "Macrozamia spiralis var. secunda, commonly known as the spiral cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the subtropical regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It is a slow-growing, long-lived species that thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
