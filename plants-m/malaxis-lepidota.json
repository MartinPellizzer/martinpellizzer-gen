    "intro": "Malaxis lepidota, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, velvety leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and thrives in acidic soils. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow and lack showy petals, instead featuring prominent sepals and a spurred labellum. Malaxis lepidota is a perennial herb that produces seeds through a complex process involving mycorrhizal fungi."
