    "intro": "Moraea moggii subsp. albescens, commonly known as the white-flowered moraea, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare in the wild."
