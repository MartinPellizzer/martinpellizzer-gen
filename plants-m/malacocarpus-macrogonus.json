    "intro": "Malacocarpus macrogonus, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the surface of still or slow-moving freshwater. The plant has a unique reproductive system, with its showy white flowers that open at night and emit a sweet fragrance to attract pollinators. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense colonies. The plant plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic life and contributing to nutrient cycling in the water."
