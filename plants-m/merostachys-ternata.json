    "intro": "Merostachys ternata, commonly known as the three-awned grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with moist, well-drained soils. The plant typically grows as a perennial herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that bear small, three-awned bristles, which are characteristic of the genus Merostachys. The plant is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
