    "intro": "Marlierea krapovickae, commonly known as the Krapovickas' marlierea, is a species of flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It is a shrub characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and its role in the biodiversity of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
