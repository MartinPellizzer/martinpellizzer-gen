It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its ovate, leathery leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom during the dry season. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, brown seeds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
