    "intro": "Miconia rariflora, commonly known as the rare-flowered miconia, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a bright red, fleshy berry that contains numerous seeds. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Miconia rariflora is considered a threatened species in its native range."
