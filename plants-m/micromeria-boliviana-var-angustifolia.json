    "intro": "Micromeria boliviana var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed micromeria, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of Bolivia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often edible or medicinal properties. The plant is characterized by its slender, angular stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, adapted to the harsh, high-altitude environment. This variety is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and potential ecological significance in its native habitat."
