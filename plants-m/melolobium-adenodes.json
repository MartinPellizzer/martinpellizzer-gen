    "intro": "Melolobium adenodes, commonly known as the stickyleaf dandelion, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, glandular-armed leaves that exude a sticky substance. The plant produces yellow flowers that develop into spherical, spiky seed heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. The sticky secretions on its leaves may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores and moisture retention."
