    "intro": "Micromeria alpestris, commonly known as alpine micromeria, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Mediterranean and Central Asia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually pale yellow or white, with five petals. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Micromeria alpestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
