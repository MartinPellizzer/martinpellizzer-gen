    "intro": "Melampyrum roseum f. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered yellow gentian, is a rare and striking variant of the yellow gentian. It is characterized by its pale to white flowers, which contrast with the typical red or orange hues of the species. The plant is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas. Its flowers are tubular and bilaterally symmetrical, typical of the Gentianaceae family. The f. albiflorum form is particularly valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in supporting pollinators."
