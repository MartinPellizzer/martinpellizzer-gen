    "intro": "Malaxis pubescens, commonly known as the hairy malaxis, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, hairy textures, which give it its common name. Malaxis pubescens is often found growing in clusters, and its unique morphology makes it a distinctive species within the Orchidaceae family."
