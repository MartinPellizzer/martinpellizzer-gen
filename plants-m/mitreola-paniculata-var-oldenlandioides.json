    "intro": "Mitreola paniculata var. oldenlandioides, commonly known as the Oldenland's bladder, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and fleshy, bladder-like structures that enclose the seeds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are usually alternate and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The fruit is a capsule that dehisces to release the seeds, contributing to its dispersal in the wild."
