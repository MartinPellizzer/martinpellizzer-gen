    "intro": "Mespilus oxyacantha var. aciphylla, commonly known as the thornless blackthorn, is a variant of the blackthorn plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, thornless stems and dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows in hedgerows, woodland edges, and rocky soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and it produces small, white, fragrant flowers in early spring. The berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife, contributing to the plant's ecological significance."
