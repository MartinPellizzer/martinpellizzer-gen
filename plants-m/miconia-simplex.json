    "intro": "Miconia simplex, commonly known as the white miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its fruit is a distinctive, spiky structure that contains numerous small seeds. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
