    "intro": "Myrcia incisa, commonly known as the pink myrtle, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like eucalyptus and guava. The plant is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves, which are usually glossy and dark green, and its clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. Myrcia incisa produces small, round berries that are typically red when mature, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
