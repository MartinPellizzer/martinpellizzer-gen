    "intro": "Malus dasyphylla f. pendula, commonly known as the weeping apple, is a unique cultivar of the apple tree characterized by its cascading branches that droop gracefully from the main trunk. This ornamental plant is native to China and is prized for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and landscapes. The foliage consists of oval, dark green leaves that provide a lush backdrop to the tree's showy white flowers in spring. The fruit, while edible, is typically small and not as flavorful as the fruit of other apple varieties. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture."
