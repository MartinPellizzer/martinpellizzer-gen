    "intro": "Magnolia ovalis, commonly known as the oval magnolia, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its large, showy, white or pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves appear. The leaves are broadly ovate, typically 5 to 10 inches long, with a smooth, glossy surface. The tree has a rounded, spreading habit and can grow up to 30 feet tall. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its spring blossoms."
