    "intro": "Melastoma pudibundum, commonly known as the shy melastoma, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Melastoma pudibundum is often found in moist, shaded forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
