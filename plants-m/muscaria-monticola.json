    "intro": "Muscaria monticola, commonly known as the mountain fly agaric, is a species of mushroom belonging to the Amanita genus. It is characterized by a distinctive white cap with red or orange warts and a pale yellow stem. The mushroom contains psychoactive compounds, primarily muscimol and ibotenic acid, which can induce hallucinogenic effects. It is typically found in temperate regions, growing in association with coniferous trees. Due to its potent effects, it is considered a hallucinogenic mushroom and is often used in both traditional and modern contexts."
