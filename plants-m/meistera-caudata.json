    "intro": "Meistera caudata, commonly known as the trailing meistera, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white and green patterns, adding visual interest to any setting. The plant produces delicate, pendulous flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Meistera caudata is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
