    "intro": "Myoporum dampieri, commonly known as the Dampier's myoporum, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and sandy soils. Myoporum dampieri is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
