It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Mimosa mellii is typically found in dry, sandy soils and can thrive in arid environments. Its growth habit is often shrub-like, with multiple stems branching from the base."
