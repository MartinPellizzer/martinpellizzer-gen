    "intro": "Malvastrum virgatum, commonly known as the common mallow, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pale pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes other well-known species such as hibiscus and cotton. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in meadows. The seeds are encased in a fluffy pappus, which aids in wind dispersal."
