    "intro": "Melaleuca viminea, commonly known as the slender bottlebrush, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia, where it typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its narrow, cylindrical stems and clusters of small, tubular red flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white wax. Melaleuca viminea is often used in coastal landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in salty environments."
