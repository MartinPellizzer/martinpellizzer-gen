    "intro": "Miconia approximata, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by distinctive, round, fleshy fruits. Miconia approximata is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in certain regions where it is not native."
