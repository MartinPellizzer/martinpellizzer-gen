    "intro": "Marattia coronata, commonly known as the crowned fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in optimal conditions. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, meaning they are divided into smaller, finger-like segments. Marattia coronata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is appreciated for its unique, elegant foliage."
