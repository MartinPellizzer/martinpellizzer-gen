    "intro": "Mikania badieri, commonly known as the Mexican morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of the Caribbean. It is a vigorous climber with heart-shaped leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. The plant is part of the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and runners. Its flowers open in the morning and close in the late afternoon, hence its common name. Mikania badieri is often found in moist, sunny environments such as forests and disturbed areas."
