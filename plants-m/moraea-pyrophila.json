    "intro": "Moraea pyrophila, commonly known as the fire-loving gladiolus, is a species of flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to fire-prone environments, often regenerating after wildfires. Its bulbs are perennial and store nutrients, allowing the plant to survive harsh conditions. Moraea pyrophila is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological role in fire-adapted ecosystems."
