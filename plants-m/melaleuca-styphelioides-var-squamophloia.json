It is characterized by its dense, silver-grey foliage and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often found in heathlands and coastal scrub. Its leaves are covered in a fine, scale-like layer, which gives it its specific epithet \"squamophloia.\" This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting native wildlife."
