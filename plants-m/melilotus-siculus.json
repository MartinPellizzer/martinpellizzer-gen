    "intro": "Melilotus siculus, commonly known as Sicilian sweet clover, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of the Mediterranean. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is known for its sweet scent and is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. It has small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with root nodules. Melilotus siculus is also valued for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
