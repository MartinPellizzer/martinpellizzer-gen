    "intro": "Medinilla venosa, commonly known as the veined medinilla, is a tropical shrub native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that often display distinct veins, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers, which are highly ornamental. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil. Medinilla venosa is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ability to bloom indoors under proper care."
