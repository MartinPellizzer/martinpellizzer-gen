    "intro": "Maurandya geniculata, commonly known as the zigzag mallow, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to pink, often with a distinctive red or purple throat. The plant features a trailing growth habit with slender, hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its prolonged blooming period, typically from late spring through early autumn."
