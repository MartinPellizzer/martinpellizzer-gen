    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 verticillata f. pseudolucorum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water mint, is a hybrid perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers arranged in whorls along the stem, typical of the Mentha genus. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. Its aromatic leaves and cooling properties make it a valuable plant in both ecological and culinary contexts."
