    "intro": "Malaxis macgregorii, commonly known as the MacGregor's Malaxis, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and prefers shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
