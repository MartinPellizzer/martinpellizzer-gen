    "intro": "Micromyrtus clavata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed bottlebrush, is a small, shrub-like plant native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, red or pink bottlebrush-like flowers that bloom in spring. The leaves are narrow and linear, often clustered at the base of the plant. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. This plant is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
