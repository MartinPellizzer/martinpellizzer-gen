    "intro": "Medicago italica var. spinosa, commonly known as thorned clover, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny stems and trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by cylindrical pods containing lens-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed but also has historical uses in agriculture and traditional medicine."
