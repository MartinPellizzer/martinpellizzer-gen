    "intro": "Mastigostyla cabrerae, commonly known as the Cabrera's lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically pale green to yellowish in color. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which allows it to thrive in various habitats. It is often found on tree bark and rocks in humid, temperate environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized organism in ecological studies."
