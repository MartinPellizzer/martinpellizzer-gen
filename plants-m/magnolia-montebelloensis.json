    "intro": "Magnolia montebelloensis, commonly known as the Montebello magnolia, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Montebello in the Tyrrhenian Sea. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters, featuring broad, ovate leaves with a smooth, dark green upper surface. The plant produces large, showy white flowers with a subtle fragrance, which bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
