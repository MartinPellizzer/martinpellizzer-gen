    "intro": "Maerua andradae, commonly known as the Cape York maerua, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of northern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, pale green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, woody fruits containing seeds. It is often found in sandy soils and is well-suited to harsh, coastal environments. Maerua andradae plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local wildlife."
