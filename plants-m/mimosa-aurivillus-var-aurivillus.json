    "intro": "Mimosa aurivillus var. aurivillus, commonly known as the golden mimosa, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by the plant's sensitivity to light and touch. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and ability to tolerate various soil conditions contribute to its adaptability in different environments."
