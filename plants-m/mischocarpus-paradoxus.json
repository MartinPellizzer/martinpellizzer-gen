    "intro": "Mischocarpus paradoxus, commonly known as the yellow myrtle, is a small evergreen tree native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by yellow, fleshy fruits that are edible for some wildlife but toxic to humans. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various native animals. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
