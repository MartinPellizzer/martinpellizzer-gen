    "intro": "Molinia caerulea f. rigida, commonly known as rigid tussock grass, is a variant of the blue moorgrass species. It is characterized by its stiff, upright growth habit and dense, compact tufts of foliage. The plant typically forms tussocks that are resistant to trampling, making it a common sight in upland and moorland environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that becomes more pronounced in the summer months. This form is often found in acidic soils and is adapted to harsh, open conditions."
