    "intro": "Miconia macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered miconia, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its large, showy, palmate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers that are arranged in inflorescences, which are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Its fruits are globose, fleshy berries that turn from green to red as they mature, attracting various bird species. Miconia macrantha is noted for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
