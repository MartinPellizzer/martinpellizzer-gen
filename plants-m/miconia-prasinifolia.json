    "intro": "Miconia prasinifolia, commonly known as the green-leaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves that are often heart-shaped or ovate in form. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
