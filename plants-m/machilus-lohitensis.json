    "intro": "Machilus lohitensis, commonly known as the Lohit privet, is a small evergreen tree native to the eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically important species in its native range."
