It is characterized by its robust, hairy stems and large, showy flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native habitat. The orchid's unique floral structure and ability to thrive in low-light conditions make it a notable species in botanical studies."
