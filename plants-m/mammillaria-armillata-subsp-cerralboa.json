It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a dense covering of white to pale blue spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its blue-green foliage. Its growth is slow, making it a popular choice for collectors and succulent enthusiasts. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it adaptable to arid environments."
