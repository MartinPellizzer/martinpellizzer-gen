    "intro": "Molinia caerulea var. sylvestris, commonly known as the woodland moorgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils found in heathlands, bogs, and woodland edges. The plant features tufted, dark green foliage with a bluish tint, and its culms are often slightly hairy. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, releasing light blue to purple flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife and biodiversity."
