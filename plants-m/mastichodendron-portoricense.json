    "intro": "Mastichodendron portoricense, commonly known as the Portuguese mastichodendron, is a rare and unique plant native to the Azores. It is characterized by its distinctive, woody, and branched structure, with small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by wind, leading to the development of small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the specific microclimate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research."
