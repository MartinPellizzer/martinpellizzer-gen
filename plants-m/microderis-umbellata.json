    "intro": "Microderis umbellata, commonly known as the umbrella fern, is a tropical plant characterized by its delicate, cascading fronds that resemble an umbrella. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to regions in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. The plant features a short, thick rhizome from which the fronds emerge, and its leaves are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, creating a feathery appearance. Microderis umbellata thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil to flourish."
