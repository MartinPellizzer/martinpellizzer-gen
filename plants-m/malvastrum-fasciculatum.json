    "intro": "Malvastrum fasciculatum, commonly known as the yellow mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which bloom in clusters and are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a soft, fuzzy texture, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements. Malvastrum fasciculatum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native gardens."
