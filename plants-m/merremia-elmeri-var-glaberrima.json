    "intro": "Merremia elmeri var. glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth merremia, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is often found in disturbed habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
