It is characterized by its large, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy, rough stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Matricaria colchica is known for its ability to spread rapidly, making it an invasive species in some regions."
