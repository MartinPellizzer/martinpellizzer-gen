    "intro": "Mariscus boeckeleri, commonly known as the Boeckeler's mariscus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations between 2,000 and 3,500 meters. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
