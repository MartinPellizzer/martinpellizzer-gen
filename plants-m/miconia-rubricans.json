    "intro": "Miconia rubricans, commonly known as the red-veined miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melastomataceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with prominent red veins, which give it its common name. It produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming during the wet season. Miconia rubricans is also known for its ability to spread rapidly, making it an invasive species in some regions outside its native range."
