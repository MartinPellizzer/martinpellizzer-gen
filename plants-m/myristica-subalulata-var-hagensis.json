    "intro": "Myristica subalulata var. hagensis, commonly known as the Hagen's nutmeg, is a species of flowering plant in the Myristicaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that are followed by reddish-brown fruits. The seeds within the fruits are encased in a thick, aromatic aril, which is often used in traditional medicine. This variety is noted for its unique chemical composition, including compounds similar to those found in true nutmeg."
