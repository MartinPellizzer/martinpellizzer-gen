    "intro": "Memecylon boinense, commonly known as the Bornean memecylon, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, simple leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, fleshy berries that are often red when mature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of primary forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
