    "intro": "Mormodes pardalinata, commonly known as the golden torch orchid, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, pendulous flowers that resemble torches, with a bright yellow coloration. The plant produces small, greenish-white leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Mormodes pardalinata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is popular in both horticultural and botanical gardens."
