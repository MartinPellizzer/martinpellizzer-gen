It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving the plant its distinctive appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. This plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
