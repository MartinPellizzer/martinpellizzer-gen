    "intro": "Mascagnia paludicola, commonly known as the swamp mascagnia, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in moist, acidic soils, often found in swamps and along stream banks. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and usually have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Mascagnia paludicola plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
