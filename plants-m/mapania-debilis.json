    "intro": "Mapania debilis, commonly known as the slender mapania, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial shade. Its ornamental value is appreciated for its unique foliage, though it is not widely cultivated outside its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
