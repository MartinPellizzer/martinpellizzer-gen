It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is known for its delicate, white to pale yellow blooms. Its name derives from the Greek words \"menis\" meaning moon and \"skiuma\" meaning shadow, possibly referring to its appearance under moonlight.
