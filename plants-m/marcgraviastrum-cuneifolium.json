    "intro": "Marcgraviastrum cuneifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees. It possesses small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along its stems. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers, which are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat its fleshy, red berries. This species is native to tropical regions of South America and is adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
