    "intro": "Mimosa pseudo-obovata, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa, is a species native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, spherical seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its unique sensitivity to touch and environmental stimuli makes it an interesting subject for botanical study."
