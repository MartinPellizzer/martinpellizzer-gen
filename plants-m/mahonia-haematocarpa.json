    "intro": "Mahonia haematocarpa, commonly known as the red-tipped barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves that are typically dark green with a reddish or purple tint on the underside. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and woodland borders. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and seasonal interest throughout the year."
