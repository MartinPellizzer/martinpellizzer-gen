    "intro": "Monstera integrifolia, commonly known as the Swiss cheese plant, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that develop distinctive holes and splits as they mature. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Its aerial roots allow it to climb and support itself on structures such as trellises or trees. Monstera integrifolia is popular as a houseplant due to its striking appearance and air-purifying properties."
