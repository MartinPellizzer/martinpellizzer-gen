    "intro": "Mastixia acuminatissima, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mastixia, is a small evergreen shrub native to eastern Australia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It is typically found in coastal heathlands and sclerophyllous forests, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
