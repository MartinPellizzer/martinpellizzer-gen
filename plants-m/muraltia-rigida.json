    "intro": "Muraltia rigida, commonly known as the rigid muraltia, is a woody shrub native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces pods that contain edible seeds, which are often used in local cuisines. Muraltia rigida is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Its growth habit makes it suitable for use in erosion control and as a living fence."
