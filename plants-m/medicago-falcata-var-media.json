It features trifoliate leaves with a distinctive, heart-shaped leaflet and produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers. The plant is characterized by its slender, branching stems and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. It is adapted to dry, sunny environments and has a deep root system for water absorption. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment in agricultural settings."
