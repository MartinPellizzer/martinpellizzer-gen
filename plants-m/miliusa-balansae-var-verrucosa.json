    "intro": "Miliusa balansae var. verrucosa, commonly known as the warty miliusa, is a rare and distinctive member of the Anacardiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in parts of Thailand and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its thick, warty bark and small, clustered leaves. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, and it produces small, red berries that are edible but have a strong, astringent flavor. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
