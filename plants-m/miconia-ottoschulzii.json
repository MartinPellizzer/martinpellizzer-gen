    "intro": "Miconia ottoschulzii, commonly known as the Otto Schulz miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly pubescent surface. The plant produces showy, bracteate inflorescences with small, pinkish-white flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Miconia ottoschulzii is often found in moist, shaded environments within tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions, though it can become invasive in some areas."
