    "intro": "Maruta foetida, commonly known as the stinking marula, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Rhamnaceae family and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and yellowish-green flowers. The tree produces small, round fruits that are edible but have a strong, unpleasant odor. Its bark is thick and fissured, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Maruta foetida thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
