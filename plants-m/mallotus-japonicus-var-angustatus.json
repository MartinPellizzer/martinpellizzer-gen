    "intro": "Mallotus japonicus var. angustatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mallot, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to Japan and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by spherical, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
