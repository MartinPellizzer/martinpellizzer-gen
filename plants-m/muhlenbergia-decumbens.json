    "intro": "Muhlenbergia decumbens, commonly known as the silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces slender, branched inflorescences with small, spikelet-like flowers that are typically pale blue to purple in color. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in dry, sandy soils. Muhlenbergia decumbens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in native landscapes."
