    "intro": "Myrica phillyreifolia var. buxifolia, commonly known as the wax myrtle or sweet myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with a waxy coating that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its aromatic foliage and ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
