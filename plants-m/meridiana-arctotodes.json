    "intro": "Meridiana arctotodes, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with rosettes of silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces showy blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Meridiana arctotodes is often found in tundra and mountainous areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
