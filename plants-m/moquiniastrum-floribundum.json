    "intro": "Moquiniastrum floribundum, commonly known as the swamp milkweed, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas of the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows up to 2 feet tall, featuring lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its showy blooms and adaptability make it a valuable addition to wetland restoration projects."
