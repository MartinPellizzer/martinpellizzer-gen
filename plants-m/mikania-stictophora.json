    "intro": "Mikania stictophora, commonly known as the silverleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its rapid growth and climbing habit, often forming dense vegetation in disturbed areas. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a silvery underside, giving it its common name. Its flowers are typically trumpet-shaped, with five petals and a distinctive coloration that varies from white to pink. Mikania stictophora is often considered an invasive species in non-native regions due to its aggressive growth and ability to outcompete native flora."
