    "intro": "Melaleuca tamariscina, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia, where it typically grows in coastal heathlands and dry sclerophyll forests. The plant is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous inner layer, and its narrow, linear leaves. It produces small white or pale pink flowers in dense spikes, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Melaleuca tamariscina is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
