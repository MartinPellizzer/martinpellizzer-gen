    "intro": "Muscari botryoides subsp. kerneri, commonly known as Kern's grape hyacinth, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It produces clusters of small, bell-shaped blue or purple flowers that resemble tiny grapes, giving it its common name. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is typically found in rocky or limestone soils. It blooms in early spring and is well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover. This subspecies is closely related to other muscari species and is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness."
