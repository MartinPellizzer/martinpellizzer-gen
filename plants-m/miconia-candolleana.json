    "intro": "Miconia candolleana, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of tropical conditions. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its competitive nature and potential ecological impact."
