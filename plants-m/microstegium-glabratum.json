    "intro": "Microstegium glabratum, commonly known as smoothfield grass, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted shoots with narrow, grass-like leaves that are smooth and glabrous. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
