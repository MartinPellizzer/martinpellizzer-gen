    "intro": "Manihot pseudopruinosa, commonly known as the rough manioc, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia. Its latex, like that of other manioc species, contains toxic compounds and requires careful processing before use. The plant is often cultivated for its starchy roots, which are a food source in some regions."
