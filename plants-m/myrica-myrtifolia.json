    "intro": "Myrica myrtifolia, commonly known as the wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, waxy leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by dark blue berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. Myrica myrtifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
