    "intro": "Microsemma, commonly known as the small-seeded orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their tiny, delicate seeds and are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Microsemma species often have slender, grass-like leaves and produce small, inconspicuous flowers. They are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic, and require high humidity and indirect light. Due to their specialized growth habits, Microsemma plants are often cultivated in controlled environments such as greenhouses."
