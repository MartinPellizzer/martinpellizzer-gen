    "intro": "Malaxis undulata, commonly known as the wavy lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spirally arranged inflorescence of pale pink to white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
