    "intro": "Myrtus villosa, commonly known as the woolly myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-blue foliage covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by dark blue berries. Myrtus villosa thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and aromatic properties."
