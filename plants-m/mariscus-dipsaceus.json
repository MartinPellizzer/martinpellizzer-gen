    "intro": "Mariscus dipsaceus, commonly known as the marsh hawksbeard, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, pond margins, and along streams. Mariscus dipsaceus plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is considered a valuable plant for wetland restoration projects."
