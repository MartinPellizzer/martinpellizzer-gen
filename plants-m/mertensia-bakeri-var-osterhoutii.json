    "intro": "Mertensia bakeri var. osterhoutii, commonly known as Osterhout's bluebells, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in shaded to partially shaded woodland habitats. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
