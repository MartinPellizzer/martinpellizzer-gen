It features small, dark green, glossy leaves that are aromatic when crushed. The plant produces tiny, white, fragrant flowers in late spring, which are followed by small, round berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and hedges. Myrtus pulchrifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in perfumery and medicine."
