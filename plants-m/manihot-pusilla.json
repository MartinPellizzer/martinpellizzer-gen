    "intro": "Manihot pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf arrowleaf, is a small shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often heart-shaped or arrowhead-like. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia, a feature common in the Euphorbiaceae family. Manihot pusilla is adapted to grow in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as savannas and forest edges. It is also noted for its latex-producing properties, which are characteristic of the genus Manihot."
