    "intro": "Microstegium tenue, commonly known as slender wood sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its stems are slender and often branch at the base, forming a low-growing mat. Microstegium tenue is known for its ability to thrive in partial to full shade and is often found in forest understories."
