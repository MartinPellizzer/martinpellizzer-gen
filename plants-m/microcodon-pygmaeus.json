    "intro": "Microcodon pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf microcodon, is a small flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. Microcodon pygmaeus is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and small size, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in its native habitat."
