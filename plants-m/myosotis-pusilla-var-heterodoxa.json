It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant produces delicate blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Due to its small size and ornamental flowers, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
