    "intro": "Malapoenna involucrata, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are arranged in umbels, attracting various pollinators. Its milky sap, which is toxic, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Malapoenna involucrata is often found in grasslands and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils."
