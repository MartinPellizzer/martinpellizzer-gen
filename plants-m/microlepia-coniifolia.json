    "intro": "Microlepia coniifolia, commonly known as the feather fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fertile fronds."
