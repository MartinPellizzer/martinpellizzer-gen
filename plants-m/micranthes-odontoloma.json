    "intro": "Micranthes odontoloma, commonly known as the toothed mouse-ear. It is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States, characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of tiny, white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated edges that give it its common name. The species is part of the Boraginaceae family, known for its blue or purple flowers, though Micranthes odontoloma produces white blooms."
