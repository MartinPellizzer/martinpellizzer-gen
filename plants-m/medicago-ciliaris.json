    "intro": "Medicago ciliaris, commonly known as the slender medick, is a low-growing perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a fibrous root system and thrives in well-drained soils, often found in disturbed areas and along roadsides. It is an important forage plant for livestock and contributes to soil nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with Rhizobium bacteria. Its adaptability and ecological benefits make it a valuable species in both agricultural and natural settings."
