    "intro": "Mauritia minor, commonly known as the dwarf palm, is a small, slow-growing palm native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It typically reaches a height of about 2 to 3 meters, with a slender trunk and clustered, fan-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that develop into black, berry-like fruits. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine, and the plant is valued for its ornamental appeal. Due to habitat loss, Mauritia minor is considered vulnerable in some regions."
