    "intro": "Malcolmia stricta, commonly known as the silverweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. Native to the Mediterranean region, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. It is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive appearance and drought tolerance."
