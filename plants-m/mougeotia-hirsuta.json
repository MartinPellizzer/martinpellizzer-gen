    "intro": "Mougeotia hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy stonewort, is a freshwater algae belonging to the order Zygnematales. It is characterized by its filamentous structure, with cells arranged in a single row along the elongated, branching thalli. The plant exhibits a distinct alternation of generations, with the gametophyte stage being the dominant phase. Its cells are covered in fine, hair-like projections, giving it a distinctive appearance. Mougeotia hirsuta typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches."
