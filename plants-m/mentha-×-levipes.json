    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 levipes, commonly known as catnip, is a hybrid plant in the mint family (Lamiaceae). It is characterized by its square stems, opposite leaves, and aromatic, glandular hairs that release a strong scent. The leaves are typically oval to lance-shaped with serrated edges, and the flowers are small, tubular, and clustered in whorls. It is native to Europe and Asia but has been widely naturalized in other regions. This plant is known for its psychoactive properties due to the presence of nepetalactone."
