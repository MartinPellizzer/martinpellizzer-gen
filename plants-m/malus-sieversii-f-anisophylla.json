    "intro": "Malus sieversii f. anisophylla, commonly known as the Anisophylla form of the Siberian crabapple, is a variant of the Malus sieversii species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology, featuring a mix of opposite and alternate leaf arrangement, which gives it its name. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, with red or pink flowers in spring. Its leaves are usually narrower and more elongated compared to the typical species, contributing to its unique appearance. This form is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its genetic diversity and potential for hybridization with other apple species."
