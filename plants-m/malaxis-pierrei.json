    "intro": "Malaxis pierrei, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, hairy, and velvety leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces intricate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicately endangered species."
