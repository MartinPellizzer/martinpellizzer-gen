    "intro": "Mesua brevipes, commonly known as the red sandalwood or hill sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in whorls of three. The plant produces fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in spring. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Mesua brevipes is valued for its hard, durable wood and is also used in traditional medicine."
