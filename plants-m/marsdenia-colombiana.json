    "intro": "Marsdenia colombiana, commonly known as the Colombian Marsdenia, is a climbing plant native to the Andes regions of Colombia. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by follicle fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
