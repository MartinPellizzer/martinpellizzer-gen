    "intro": "Marila podantha, commonly known as the narrow-leafed marila, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly seen in its natural habitat."
