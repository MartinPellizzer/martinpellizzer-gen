    "intro": "Monoplectra, commonly known as the common milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to various regions of North America. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fluffy white flowers that are highly attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its sap contains latex, which is toxic to some animals but beneficial for the monarch butterfly larvae. Monoplectra plays an important ecological role in supporting native wildlife and maintaining biodiversity."
