    "intro": "Microchilus ovatus, commonly known as the oval-leaved microchilus, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, ovate leaves that are often hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in umbel-like clusters, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in woodland or shaded areas. Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species in its native habitat."
