    "intro": "Marattia mertensiana, commonly known as the Mertens' fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Marattiaceae and is characterized by its large, compound fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The plant is typically found in humid, shaded environments such as tropical rainforests and swampy areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of roots, which help anchor it to moist soil or substrates. Marattia mertensiana is notable for its slow growth and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
