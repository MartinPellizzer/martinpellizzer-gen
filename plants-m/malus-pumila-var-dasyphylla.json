It is characterized by its thick, rough-textured leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, tart apples that are typically used for culinary purposes rather than commercial fruit production. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique foliage. This variety is also valued for its hardiness and ability to adapt to various soil conditions."
