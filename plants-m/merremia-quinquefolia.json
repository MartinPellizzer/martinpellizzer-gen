    "intro": "Merremia quinquefolia, commonly known as the five-leaved morning glory, is a climbing vine native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically five-lobed, and its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that open in the morning. The plant produces yellowish-orange fruits that contain seeds, and it thrives in warm, humid climates. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Merremia quinquefolia is a member of the Convolvulaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with similar climbing habits."
