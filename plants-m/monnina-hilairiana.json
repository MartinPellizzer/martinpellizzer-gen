It is a low-growing annual herb that typically reaches a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant features slender, branching stems covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it its common name. Its small, pink to purple flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Monnina hilairiana is often found in disturbed soils and arid environments, making it a common weed in agricultural areas."
