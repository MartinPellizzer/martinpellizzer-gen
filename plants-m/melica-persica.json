    "intro": "Melica persica, commonly known as Persian millet, is a perennial grass species native to the Middle East and Central Asia. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences with bisexual flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
