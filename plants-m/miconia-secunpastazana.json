    "intro": "Miconia secunpastazana, commonly known as the Guiana miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its striking, large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
