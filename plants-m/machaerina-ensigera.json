    "intro": "Machaerina ensigera, commonly known as the New Zealand flax, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its long, strap-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous green flowers that are typically followed by distinctive blue or purple berries. It is often found in coastal and lowland areas, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Machaerina ensigera has been used traditionally by M\u0101ori for its strong, fibrous leaves, which were used to make clothing and other crafts."
