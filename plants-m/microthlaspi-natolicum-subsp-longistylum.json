    "intro": "Microthlaspi natolicum subsp. longistylum, commonly known as the long-stemmed rockcress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and slender, branching stems. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, typical of the mustard family. Its leaves are typically linear to oblanceolate, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This subspecies is adapted to rocky or gravelly habitats and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions."
