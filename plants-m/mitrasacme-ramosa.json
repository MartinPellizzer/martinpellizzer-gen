    "intro": "Mitrasacme ramosa, commonly known as the hairy mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by berries that are typically red or orange in color. It relies on its host for water and nutrients but can photosynthesize to some extent. Due to its parasitic nature, it can sometimes cause stress to the host tree if it becomes too abundant."
