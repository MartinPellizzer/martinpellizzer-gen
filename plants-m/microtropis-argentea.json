It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. The leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
