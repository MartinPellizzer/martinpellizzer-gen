    "intro": "Madhuca cochinchinensis, commonly known as the wild mango or white candlewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by edible, round fruits with a thick, fibrous pulp. Its seeds are encased in a hard, woody shell, and the plant is valued for its timber, which is durable and used in construction and furniture-making. Additionally, it plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining biodiversity in its native habitats."
