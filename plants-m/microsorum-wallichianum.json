    "intro": "Microsorum wallichianum, commonly known as the Wallich's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are divided into small, feathery segments. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds and streams. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, anchoring the plant and facilitating growth. Microsorum wallichianum is valued in aquariums for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide shelter for aquatic life."
