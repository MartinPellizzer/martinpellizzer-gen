    "intro": "Microchilus federalensis, commonly known as the federal endemic microchilus, is a rare flowering plant native to a specific region in the United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and umbel-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. It is notable for its unique floral structure and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential ecological significance. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
