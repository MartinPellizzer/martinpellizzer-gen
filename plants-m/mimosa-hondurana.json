It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its legume fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant features compound leaves that are sensitive to touch, folding when disturbed, a trait known as thigmonastic response. It produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Mimosa hondurana is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks."
