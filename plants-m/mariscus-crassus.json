    "intro": "Mariscus crassus, commonly known as the broadleaf mariscus, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial herb characterized by its robust, upright stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping."
