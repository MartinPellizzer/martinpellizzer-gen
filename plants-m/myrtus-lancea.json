    "intro": "Myrtus lancea, commonly known as the common myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and aromatic, often with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in spring, which are followed by dark blue, edible berries. Myrtus lancea is well adapted to coastal and rocky environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils. Its ornamental value and historical significance in traditional medicine and rituals make it a notable botanical species."
