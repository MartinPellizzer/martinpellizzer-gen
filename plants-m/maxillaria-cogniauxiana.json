    "intro": "Maxillaria cogniauxiana, commonly known as the Cogniaux's orchid, is a species native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white, yellow, and pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical, and it produces linear, grass-like leaves that help in photosynthesis. The flowers are often clustered in inflorescences and are prized for their ornamental value in horticulture."
