    "intro": "Mathiolaria glabrata, commonly known as the smoothleaf mathiolaria, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are smooth and elliptical, with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture. The flowers, which are usually pink or red, bloom in spring and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
