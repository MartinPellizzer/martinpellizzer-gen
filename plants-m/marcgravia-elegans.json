    "intro": "Marcgravia elegans, commonly known as the velvetleaf or hanging plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows as an epiphyte on trees. The plant is characterized by its large, velvety, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers. Its unique morphology allows it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Marcgravia elegans is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to add a lush, green presence to hanging baskets or vertical gardens."
