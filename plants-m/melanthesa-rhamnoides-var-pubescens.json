    "intro": "Melanthesa rhamnoides var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy bittercress, is a low-growing annual herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, branching stems that are covered in fine, pubescent hairs, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with four petals, typically arranged in clusters at the leaf axils. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. The hairy bittercress thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides."
