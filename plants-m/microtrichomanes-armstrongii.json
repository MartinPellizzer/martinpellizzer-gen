    "intro": "Microtrichomanes armstrongii, commonly known as the Armstrong's microtrichomanes, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Microtrichomanes armstrongii is notable for its intricate leaf venation and its role in epiphytic ecosystems."
