    "intro": "Melocactus deinacanthus subsp. florschuetzianus, commonly known as the Sch\u00fctz's melon cactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that is often ribbed and covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to desert environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
