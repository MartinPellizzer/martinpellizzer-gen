It is characterized by its large, showy, white to pale pink bracts that resemble petals, though they are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that emerge from the base of these bracts. It typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture with a rough surface."
