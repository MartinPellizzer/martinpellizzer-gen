It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by yellowish-orange fruits containing sticky, aromatic pulp. Its wood is valued for its durability and fine grain, though it is often used in local construction and traditional crafts. The plant is also noted for its ecological importance in supporting various wildlife species."
