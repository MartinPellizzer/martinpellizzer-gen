The plant produces tiny, pale pink to white flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, dark blue berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Myrtus prostrata is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
