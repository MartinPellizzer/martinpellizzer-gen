It is characterized by its square stems, opposite leaves, and small, pale purple flowers that bloom in whorls along the stem. The plant thrives in moist environments such as stream banks, wet meadows, and damp woodlands. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils that contribute to its distinctive minty scent. Mentha fontana is often used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb."
