    "intro": "Miconia inaequidens, commonly known as the unequal-leaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Miconia inaequidens is known for its rapid growth and can become invasive in certain regions, making it a plant of ecological concern."
