    "intro": "Micronoma, commonly known as the dwarf lichen, is a genus of lichens characterized by its small, crust-like growth form. It consists of a symbiotic partnership between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. Micronoma species are often found on tree bark, rocks, or soil surfaces in temperate and tropical regions. They play a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in their ecosystems. Due to their small size and cryptic appearance, they are often overlooked in ecological studies."
