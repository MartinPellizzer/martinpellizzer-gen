    "intro": "Muehlenbeckia axillaris, commonly known as silverweed, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches a height of about 30 centimeters. The plant features small, clustered white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by bright red berries. Its leaves are silvery-gray due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which gives it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions."
