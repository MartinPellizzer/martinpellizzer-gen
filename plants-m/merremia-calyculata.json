    "intro": "Merremia calyculata, commonly known as the yellow wood vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a woody stem and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its flowers attract pollinators like bees and birds, contributing to its ecological role. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds."
