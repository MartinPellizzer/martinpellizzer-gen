    "intro": "Malva sylvestris var. incanescens, commonly known as the hairy mallow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fuzzy, grayish-green leaves and showy, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and along stream banks. Its flowers are composed of five petals and numerous stamens, and it produces fluffy, cotton-like seed capsules that aid in wind dispersal. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its soothing properties."
