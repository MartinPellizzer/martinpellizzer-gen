It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of tubular or funnel-shaped blooms in shades of pink, purple, and white. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.
