    "intro": "Mentha umbraticola, commonly known as shadow mint, is a rare and lesser-known species of mint. It is characterized by its aromatic, slightly minty leaves and prefers shaded, moist environments. This plant typically grows in temperate regions with high humidity and partial to full shade. Its botanical features include narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution, it is often found in specific microhabitats such as forest floors or shaded wetlands."
