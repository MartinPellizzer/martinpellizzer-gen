    "intro": "Monstera adansonii var. klotzschiana, commonly known as the Swiss cheese plant, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that develop distinctive holes and splits as they mature. This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its striking foliage and air-purifying qualities. The varietal name \"klotzschiana\" honors the botanist Friedrich Klotzsch, who contributed to its classification."
