It is a member of the Menispermaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and climbing habit. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its berries, which are typically red or orange, contain seeds and are an important food source for various wildlife. The plant's rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its toxicity should be noted."
