    "intro": "Malania, commonly known as the Malania orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The plants are characterized by their striking, showy flowers that often display vibrant colors such as red, orange, and yellow. Malania species typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, attaching themselves to trees or rocks in their natural habitats. These plants require specific environmental conditions, including high humidity and indirect light, to thrive."
