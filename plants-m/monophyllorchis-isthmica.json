    "intro": "Monophyllorchis isthmica, commonly known as the Isthmus butterfly orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is characterized by its small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom during the late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are strap-like and often clustered at the base, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
