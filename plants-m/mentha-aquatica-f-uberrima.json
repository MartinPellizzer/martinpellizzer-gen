    "intro": "Mentha aquatica f. uberrima, commonly known as water mint, is a variant of the water mint plant native to moist environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, slightly menthol-like leaves and flowers that bloom in spikes of purple or blue. The plant thrives in wet soils near streams, marshes, and ponds, making it a common sight in riparian zones. Its leaves are often used in herbal teas and traditional medicine for their cooling and digestive properties. The subspecies f. uberrima is distinguished by its more robust growth and higher essential oil content compared to other forms of Mentha aquatica."
