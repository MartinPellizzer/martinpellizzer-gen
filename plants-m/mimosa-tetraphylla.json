    "intro": "Mimosa tetraphylla, commonly known as the white mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant has a distinctive feature of its leaves curling when touched, a response known as thigmonasty. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and rocky areas. The seeds are encased in a hairy pod and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural distribution."
