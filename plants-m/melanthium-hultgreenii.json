    "intro": "Melanthium hultgreenii, commonly known as Hultgreen's grassvetch, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
