    "intro": "Mendoncia coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf mendoncia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a fine, fuzzy texture, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom during the cooler months of the year. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
