    "intro": "Melampyrum pratense subsp. vulgatum, commonly known as common touch-me-not, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are alternate and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its preferred environments."
