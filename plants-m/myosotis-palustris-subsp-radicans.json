    "intro": "Myosotis palustris subsp. radicans, commonly known as the trailing water forget-me-not, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in Europe. It features slender,\u530d\u5310\u7684 (creeping) stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often slightly hairy, and are arranged alternately along the stems. This subspecies is well adapted to moist environments and is often found in shaded, waterlogged soils."
