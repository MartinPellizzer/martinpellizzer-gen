    "intro": "Macleania coccinea, commonly known as the red-leaved miconia, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage, which contrasts beautifully with its glossy, dark green stems. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a velvety texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native flora."
