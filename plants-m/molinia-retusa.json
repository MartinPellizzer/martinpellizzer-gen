It typically grows in moist, acidic soils, often found in heathlands and wet meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer. It plays an important role in maintaining biodiversity in its native habitats. Molinia retusa is also valued for its ornamental appeal in certain landscaping settings."
