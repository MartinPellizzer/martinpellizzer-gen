    "intro": "Mimosa amara, commonly known as the bitter mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellow flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, and it is often found in dry, rocky soils. Mimosa amara has a shallow root system and is adapted to arid environments. It is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its toxic properties limit its widespread use."
