    "intro": "Malaxis bispirifera, commonly known as the spiral-leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, spirally twisted leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its root system is specialized for epiphytic or lithophytic growth, allowing it to absorb nutrients from the air and rain. Malaxis bispirifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
