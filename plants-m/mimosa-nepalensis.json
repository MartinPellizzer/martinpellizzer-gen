    "intro": "Mimosa nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal mimosa, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and northern India. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a phenomenon known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in spring, followed by flat, pod-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Mimosa nepalensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in local medicine."
