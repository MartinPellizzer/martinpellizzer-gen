    "intro": "Mimosa invisa subsp. invisa, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a species native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut in response to touch, light, or wind, a phenomenon known as thigmonastic movement. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its rapid leaf movement makes it an interesting subject for botanical study and a popular ornamental plant."
