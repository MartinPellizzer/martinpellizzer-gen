    "intro": "Malaxis blephariglottis, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, hood-like floral structure that encloses the reproductive organs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its leaves are linear and often covered with a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. The flowers, which are usually pale green or yellow, are adapted for pollination by specific insect species."
