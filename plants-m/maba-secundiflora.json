    "intro": "Maba secundiflora, commonly known as the Mexican maba, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central America and northern South America. It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters along the branches. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, facilitating wind dispersal. Maba secundiflora is valued for its timber and has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes."
