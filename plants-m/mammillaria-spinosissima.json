It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines and small, rounded tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, spherical fruits. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
