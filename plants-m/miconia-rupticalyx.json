    "intro": "Miconia rupticalyx, commonly known as the scarlet miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom throughout the wet season. Its fruit is a bright red, fleshy berry that contains numerous seeds. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
