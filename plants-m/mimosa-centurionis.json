    "intro": "Mimosa centurionis, commonly known as the centurion tree, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in spherical clusters, which bloom in the summer months. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. Mimosa centurionis is also notable for its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
