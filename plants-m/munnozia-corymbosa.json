    "intro": "Munnozia corymbosa, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its dense, globular growth habit and silver-gray foliage. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves and stems are adapted to store water, making it highly drought-tolerant. Munnozia corymbosa is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping in dry climates."
