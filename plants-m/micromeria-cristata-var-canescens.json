It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant has hairy, grayish foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It blooms from spring to early summer, producing nectar that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
