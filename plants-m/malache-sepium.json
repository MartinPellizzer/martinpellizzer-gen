    "intro": "Malache sepium, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species in many regions."
