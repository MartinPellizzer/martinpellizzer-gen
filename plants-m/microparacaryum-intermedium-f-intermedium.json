    "intro": "Microparacaryum intermedium f. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate microparacaryum, is a rare and delicate aquatic plant belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length, arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually submerged, with both male and female reproductive structures present on the same inflorescence. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments with soft, acidic water conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
