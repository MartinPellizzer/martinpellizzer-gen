    "intro": "Melica \u00d7 thuringiaca subsp. langeana, commonly known as the Lange's wheatgrass, is a hybrid grass species native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, leafy stems that often form dense clumps. The plant typically produces spikelets that are arranged in a loose panicle, with each spikelet containing two to three small, awned florets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that becomes more pronounced as the plant matures. This subspecies is often found in moist meadows and along stream banks, where it thrives in well-drained, loamy soils."
