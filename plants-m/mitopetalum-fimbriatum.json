    "intro": "Mitopetalum fimbriatum, commonly known as the fringed petal lichen, is a member of the family Teloschistaceae. It is a crustose lichen that typically grows on bark, stone, or soil in temperate regions. The plant's thallus is usually pale to dark grey, with a finely granular surface. Its apothecia are disc-shaped and bear ascospores that are ellipsoidal in shape. This lichen is often used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants."
