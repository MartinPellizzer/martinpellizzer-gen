    "intro": "Mikania microdonta var. stylosa, commonly known as the slender leaf mile-a-minute vine, is a fast-growing perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender stems, heart-shaped leaves, and small, pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant is known for its rapid growth rate, often spreading aggressively through vegetative propagation. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in woodland edges and along stream banks. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
