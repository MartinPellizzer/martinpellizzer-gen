    "intro": "Malaxis mambulilingensis, commonly known as the Mindanao ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, thriving in the tropical rainforests of Mindanao. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species."
