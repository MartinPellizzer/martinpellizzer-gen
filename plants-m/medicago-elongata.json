    "intro": "Medicago elongata, commonly known as the narrowleaf medick, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems and small, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, followed by small, elongated pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas. As a member of the legume family, it has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria."
