    "intro": "Myosotis hispida var. lebelii, commonly known as the hairy forget-me-not, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, blue or violet flowers and hairy stems and leaves, which give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
