It is characterized by its ornamental value, featuring showy flowers and vibrant red or orange fruits. The plant has oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn, adding to its seasonal appeal. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. The fruits are edible but often used in jams and jellies rather than consumed fresh."
