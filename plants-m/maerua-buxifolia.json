    "intro": "Maerua buxifolia, commonly known as the African snowberry, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with small, rounded, glossy leaves that resemble those of boxwood. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are edible for humans and animals. It is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy and resilient species. Its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soils make it a popular choice for landscaping in dry climates."
