It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are usually arranged in clusters along the stems.

This variant is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and rocky outcrops."
