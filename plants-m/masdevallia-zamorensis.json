    "intro": "Masdevallia zamorensis, commonly known as the Zamora masdevallia, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, often colorful flowers with long, slender petals. The plant typically grows as a miniature epiphyte, attaching itself to tree branches in its natural habitat. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it thrives in cool, humid conditions with indirect light. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
