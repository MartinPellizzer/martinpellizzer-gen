    "intro": "Marsilea berhautii, commonly known as the water clover, is a small aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its four-leaf clover-like structure, with each leaflet being a small, rounded, floating leaf. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and wetlands. Its roots are anchored in the sediment, while its leaves float on the water surface. Marsilea berhautii plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms."
