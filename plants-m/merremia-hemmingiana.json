    "intro": "Merremia hemmingiana, commonly known as the Hemming's morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, black seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive if not controlled."
