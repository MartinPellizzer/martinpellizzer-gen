    "intro": "Marianthemum lingulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed marshweed, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Its small, white flowers bloom in clusters during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Marianthemum lingulatum plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
