    "intro": "Mascagnia lucida subsp. orientensis, commonly known as the oriental moonflower, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is a shrub that typically grows in forested areas and is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves. The plant produces showy, white, night-blooming flowers that emit a fragrant scent, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after species in horticulture, though it is relatively rare in cultivation. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different leaf shape and flower structure compared to the nominate form."
