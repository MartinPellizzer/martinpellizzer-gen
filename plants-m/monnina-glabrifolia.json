It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its flowering period occurs in the spring and early summer, and it is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dry fields. Monnina glabrifolia is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize open spaces, contributing to the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
