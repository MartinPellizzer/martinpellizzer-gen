    "intro": "Mammillaria parvimamma, commonly known as the small-nosed hedgehog cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a short, cylindrical stem and a dense covering of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Due to its compact size and ornamental appearance, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in rock gardens."
