    "intro": "Metastelma microgynostegium, commonly known as the small-leafed metastelma, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments within dense forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
