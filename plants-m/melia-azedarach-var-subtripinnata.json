    "intro": "Melia azedarach var. subtripinnata, commonly known as the Chinese sumac or staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately divided into three to five pairs of leaflets, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are toxic to humans and livestock. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is adaptable to various soil types, making it a hardy ornamental plant. The species is also notable for its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of natural insecticides."
