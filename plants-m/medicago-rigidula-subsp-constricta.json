    "intro": "Medicago rigidula subsp. constricta, commonly known as narrowleaf medick, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, trifoliate leaves with a narrow, elongated shape. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by narrow, curved pods containing several seeds. It is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
