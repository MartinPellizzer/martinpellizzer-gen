    "intro": "Manulea calciphila, commonly known as the limestone lichen, is a rare and specialized plant that thrives in calcareous (limestone) environments. It is a lichen, a symbiotic composite organism formed by a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. This species is adapted to grow on rocky substrates, where it can absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its presence is often an indicator of stable, alkaline soil conditions. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Manulea calciphila is considered a sensitive species and is often protected in conservation efforts."
