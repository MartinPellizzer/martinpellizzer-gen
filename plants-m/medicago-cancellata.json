    "intro": "Medicago cancellata, commonly known as the white clover, is a low-growing perennial legume native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically pale green to white in color, and its small, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils. Medicago cancellata is widely used in forage agriculture and as a cover crop due to its hardiness and ecological benefits."
