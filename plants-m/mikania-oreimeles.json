    "intro": "Mikania oreimeles, commonly known as the cloud mountain wisteria, is a climbing vine native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rapid growth and extensive leaf coverage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often resembling those of the genus Vitex. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a velvety texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it is often considered a weed in its native habitat."
