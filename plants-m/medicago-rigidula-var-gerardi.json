    "intro": "Medicago rigidula var. gerardi, commonly known as the rigid milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep purple. The plant has trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets and produces cylindrical, woody pods that contain lens-shaped seeds. It is adapted to poor soils and can thrive in harsh, dry environments. This species is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve fertility through nitrogen fixation."
