    "intro": "Medicago hirsutissima, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, followed by pods containing several seeds. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. Medicago hirsutissima is often used as a cover crop and forage in agricultural settings."
