    "intro": "Miconia spiraeifolia, commonly known as the spiraeoid miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a round, fleshy berry that turns red when mature, containing numerous seeds. Miconia spiraeifolia is known for its rapid growth and has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming invasive."
