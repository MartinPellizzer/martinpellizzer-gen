    "intro": "Mikania cordata var. chevalieri, commonly known as the velvetleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a perennial vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in many regions."
