The plant thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that adds visual interest to wetland landscapes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
