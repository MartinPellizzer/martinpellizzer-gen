    "intro": "Mascagnia rivularis, commonly known as the river mascagnia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows near water sources, such as rivers and wetlands, due to its preference for moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Mascagnia rivularis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate moisture conditions."
