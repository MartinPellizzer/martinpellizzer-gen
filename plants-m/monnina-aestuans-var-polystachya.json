    "intro": "Monnina aestuans var. polystachya, commonly known as coastal blueweed, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the United States. It is a low-growing, herbaceous annual that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines. The plant produces small, clustered blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
