    "intro": "Mimosa blancoana, commonly known as the white mimosa, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, fluffy flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into pods containing seeds, typical of the legume family. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils. The leaves are sensitive to touch, curling up when disturbed, a trait shared with other mimosa species."
