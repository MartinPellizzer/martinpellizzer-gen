    "intro": "Mespilus glandulosa, commonly known as the European medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its oval, glossy leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces edible fruits that ripen in the fall, turning from green to a deep red-brown color. These fruits are known for their aromatic, sweet flavor when fully mature. Mespilus glandulosa is often cultivated for ornamental purposes and has a long history of use in traditional medicine."
