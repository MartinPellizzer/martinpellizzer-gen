    "intro": "Macroptilium monophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf stylo, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It features trifoliate leaves with narrow, lance-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in spikes. The plant has a deep root system that helps it thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. It is often used in forage systems due to its high nutritional value for livestock. Additionally, it plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
