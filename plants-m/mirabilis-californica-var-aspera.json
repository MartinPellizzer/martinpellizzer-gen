    "intro": "Mirabilis californica var. aspera, commonly known as the roughleaf four o'clock, is a flowering plant native to California. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. It thrives in full sun and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. The flowers open in the late afternoon and close by morning, a trait typical of the four o'clock plant genus."
