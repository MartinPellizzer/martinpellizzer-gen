    "intro": "Melastoma squamosum, commonly known as the scarlet beauty or red-flowered melastoma, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring opposite, elliptical leaves with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside. The plant produces clusters of small, showy red or pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its fruits are capsules that split open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Melastoma squamosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
