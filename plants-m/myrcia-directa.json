It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces bright red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various bird species. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
