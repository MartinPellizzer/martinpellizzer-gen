    "intro": "Mimosa depauperata, commonly known as the poor mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. Mimosa depauperata is also known for its sensitive leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait that gives it its common name."
