    "intro": "Mimosa pachecensis, commonly known as the Mexican mimosa, is a shrub native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are composed of numerous small leaflets that fold shut when touched, a response known as thigmonastic movement. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, making it a suitable ornamental plant in warm climates. Mimosa pachecensis is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
