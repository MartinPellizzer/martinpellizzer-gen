    "intro": "Myroxylon paliurus, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and compound leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered vulnerable in some regions."
