    "intro": "Moraea reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined moraea, is a striking perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive reticulate (net-like) venation pattern, which gives it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or gravelly habitats. Moraea reticulata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
