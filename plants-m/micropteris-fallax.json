    "intro": "Micropteris fallax, commonly known as the false holly fern, is a delicate fern species native to the southeastern United States. It features finely divided, bright green fronds that are typically 15 to 30 centimeters long. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Micropteris fallax is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to add a touch of elegance to shaded landscapes."
