    "intro": "Mammillaria candida var. sphaerotricha, commonly known as the white globular cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a rounded stem covered in white, woolly spines that give it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Its slow growth rate makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
