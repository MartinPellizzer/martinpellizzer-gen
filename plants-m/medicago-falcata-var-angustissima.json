    "intro": "Medicago falcata var. angustissima, commonly known as narrowleaf sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, angular stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Narrowleaf sainfoin is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen and its use as a forage plant for livestock."
