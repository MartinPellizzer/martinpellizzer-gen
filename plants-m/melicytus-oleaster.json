    "intro": "Melicytus oleaster, commonly known as the silver fern, is a shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in coastal areas and forest margins. Melicytus oleaster has cultural significance to M\u0101ori and is also valued for its ornamental appeal."
