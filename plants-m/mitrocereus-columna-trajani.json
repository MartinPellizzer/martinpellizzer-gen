    "intro": "Mitrocereus columna-trajani, commonly known as the Trajan's column cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant features prominent areoles from which both spines and flowers emerge. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, blooming at night, which is a common trait among many cacti in its habitat. The plant is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
