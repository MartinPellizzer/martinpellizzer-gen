    "intro": "Medicago polymorpha var. nigra, commonly known as black medick, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, dark green trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. Black medick is also valued for its use in forage and as a cover crop in agricultural settings."
