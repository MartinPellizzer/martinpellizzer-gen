    "intro": "Mascarenhasia fischeri, commonly known as the Mascarene dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a dandelion. The plant has basal leaves that are typically hairy and lance-shaped, while its stems are erect and often branched. It produces small, yellow flowers that develop into fluffy, white seed heads, facilitating wind dispersal of its seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
