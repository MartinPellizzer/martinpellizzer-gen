    "intro": "Mimosa hirsutissima f. decumbens, commonly known as the decumbent sensitive plant, is a variant of the sensitive plant species native to South America. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit and hairy, fern-like leaves. The plant is notable for its rapid leaf closure in response to touch, a trait known as thigmonasty. Its small, yellowish-white flowers appear in clusters and bloom during the warmer months. This form is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and interesting botanical behavior."
