    "intro": "Myrosma dasycarpa, commonly known as the hairy-fruited myrosma, is a shrub native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Rosaceae, which includes roses and other flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its dense, glandular hairs on the stems and leaves, giving it a rough texture. Its small, white flowers bloom in the spring, and the fruits are dry, capsule-like structures that split open to release seeds. It is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments."
