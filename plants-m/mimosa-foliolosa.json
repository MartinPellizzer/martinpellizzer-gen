    "intro": "Mimosa foliolosa, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its feathery leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimuli. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often grown as an ornamental plant. Its unique sensitivity to touch makes it a popular subject in botanical studies and educational settings."
