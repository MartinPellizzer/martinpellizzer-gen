    "intro": "Monteverdia tikalensis, commonly known as the Tikal's monteverdia, is a rare and endemic species native to the tropical rainforests of Guatemala. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, and prefers shaded, moist environments. Its flowers, which are usually pink or white, are adapted for pollination by specific insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Monteverdia tikalensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
