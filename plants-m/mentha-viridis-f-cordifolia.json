    "intro": "Mentha viridis f. cordifolia, commonly known as heartleaf mint, is a variant of the common spearmint plant. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which distinguish it from the typical lance-shaped leaves of the species Mentha viridis. This plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, shaded environments. It produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The foliage is aromatic and often used in culinary and medicinal applications."
