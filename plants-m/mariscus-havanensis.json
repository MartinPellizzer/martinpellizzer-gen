    "intro": "Mariscus havanensis, commonly known as the Cuban mariscus, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and humid conditions. Its flowers are often pink or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
