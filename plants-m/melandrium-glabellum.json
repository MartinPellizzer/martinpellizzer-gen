    "intro": "Melandrium glabellum, commonly known as the smooth sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and desert margins. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, while its stems are erect and branched. Melandrium glabellum is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
