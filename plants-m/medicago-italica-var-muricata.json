    "intro": "Medicago italica var. muricata, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant characterized by its trifoliate leaves and distinctive, hairy stems. It produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in loose inflorescences, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. This variety is well adapted to temperate climates and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a common weed in agricultural fields. Its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia makes it valuable for soil enrichment. The plant's hairy texture and robust growth habit contribute to its ecological and agricultural significance."
