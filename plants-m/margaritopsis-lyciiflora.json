    "intro": "Margaritopsis lyciiflora, commonly known as the red-flowered rock cress, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, bright red flowers that bloom in spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its foliage. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Margaritopsis lyciiflora is well adapted to coastal and inland rocky habitats, thriving in full sun and well-drained soil."
