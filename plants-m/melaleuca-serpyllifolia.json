    "intro": "Melaleuca serpyllifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf paperbark, is a shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and distinctive, aromatic, bottlebrush-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces woody capsules as fruit, which contain numerous small, flat seeds. It typically grows in coastal or sandy soils and is often found in heathland or open forests. Melaleuca serpyllifolia is well adapted to fire-prone environments and can resprout from its lignified stems after bushfires."
