It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive rhizome system that supports its growth in moist, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered in specialized indusia on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitats."
