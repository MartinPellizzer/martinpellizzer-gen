It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and pinnately divided, contributing to its delicate, grass-like appearance. Meniscium meniscioides is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual appeal."
