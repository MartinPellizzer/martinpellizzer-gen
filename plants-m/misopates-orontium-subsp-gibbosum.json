    "intro": "Misopates orontium subsp. gibbosum, commonly known as the globular bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant characterized by its unique bladder-like structures used for capturing prey. It is a member of the Lentibulariaceae family and is known for its carnivorous behavior, utilizing specialized bladder cells to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Its flowers are small and usually white or pale purple, with distinctive spurred petals. The subspecies gibbosum is distinguished by its inflated, globular bladders, which are more prominent than those of other subspecies."
