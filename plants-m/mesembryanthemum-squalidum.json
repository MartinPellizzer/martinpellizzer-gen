    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum squalidum, commonly known as the stinkweed or desert star, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, ribbed stems and leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. Mesembryanthemum squalidum is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in full sun with minimal water."
