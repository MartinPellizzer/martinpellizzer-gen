    "intro": "Mimulus grandiflorus, commonly known as the common yellow water-lily, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its showy, bright orange or yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and often have a waxy coating to repel water. Mimulus grandiflorus plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
