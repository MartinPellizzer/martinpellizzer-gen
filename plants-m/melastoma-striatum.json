    "intro": "Melastoma striatum, commonly known as the red-flowered melastoma, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a shrub characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves and striking red or pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are often eaten by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Melastoma striatum is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
