    "intro": "Mammillaria coronaria var. beneckei, commonly known as the Desert Star Cactus, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It features a spherical or slightly elongated stem covered in white to pale green tubercles, which are small, rounded bumps. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted foliage. It is well adapted to hot, dry environments and requires minimal water, making it an ideal choice for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular specimen among cactus enthusiasts and collectors."
