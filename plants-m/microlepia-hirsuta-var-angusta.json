    "intro": "Microlepia hirsuta var. angusta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sword fern, is a variant of the hirsute sword fern native to Southeast Asia. It is a perennial fern characterized by its slender, arching fronds that are typically narrower than those of the typical variety. The plant features fertile fronds with spore-bearing structures called sori, which are arranged along the margins of the leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
