    "intro": "Myrcia eugenioides, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a member of the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces small, red, berry-like fruits that are edible but have a strong, spicy flavor. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in non-native habitats."
