    "intro": "Malcolmia conringioides, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy species in desert environments. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, are usually pale yellow or white, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
