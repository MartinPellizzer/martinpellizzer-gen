    "intro": "Micrandra sprucei, commonly known as the Spruce's micrandra, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
