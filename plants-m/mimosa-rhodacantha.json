    "intro": "Mimosa rhodacantha, commonly known as the pink mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in response to touch, a trait known as thigmonasty. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its ability to fix nitrogen through root nodules also makes it beneficial for soil enrichment."
