    "intro": "Mimulus langsdorffii var. guttatus, commonly known as the spotted monkeyflower, is a flowering plant native to western North America. It is characterized by its vibrant orange or red tubular flowers, which are adapted for pollination by hummingbirds. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along streambanks and in open woodlands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture. This variant is distinguished by its distinctive spotted or mottled patterns on the petals, which set it apart from other Mimulus species."
