    "intro": "Melanoseris henryi, commonly known as the Henry's melanic orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its unique dark green to almost black foliage and its delicate, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Melanoseris henryi is considered a rare and under-studied species in the orchid family."
