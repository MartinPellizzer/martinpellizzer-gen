It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is typically found growing on rocky substrates in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually greenish or brownish in color, with a distinctive lip petal. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a rosette at the base. Marginaria pleopeltidis is adapted to survive in harsh conditions, with deep root systems that help it access moisture in dry soils."
