    "intro": "Malvastrum dissectum, commonly known as the cutleaf mallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features palmately lobed leaves that are deeply dissected, giving it a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. The plant produces showy, pale pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its botanical characteristics make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable in arid landscapes."
