    "intro": "Manulea longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered manulea, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Ethiopian Highlands. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
