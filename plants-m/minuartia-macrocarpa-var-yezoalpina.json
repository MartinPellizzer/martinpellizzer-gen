    "intro": "Minuartia macrocarpa var. yezoalpina, commonly known as the Yezo alpine sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It features small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are adapted to retain moisture in its harsh, alpine environment. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for cold climates and high-altitude ecosystems."
