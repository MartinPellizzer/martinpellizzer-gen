It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and white. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, hairy leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it an attractive and low-maintenance addition to gardens."
