    "intro": "Medicago falcata var. ramosissima, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often hairy, and its trailing growth habit that forms dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers followed by cylindrical, dehiscent pods containing several seeds. It has deep roots that help improve soil structure and fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil fertility. Its adaptability to various soil types and drought tolerance make it a valuable forage and cover crop."
