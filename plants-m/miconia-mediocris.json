    "intro": "Miconia mediocris, commonly known as the small miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the Melastomataceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its large, broad leaves and clusters of small, white or pink flowers. It produces berries that are often eaten by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
