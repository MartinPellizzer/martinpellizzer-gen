    "intro": "Moltkia longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and pairs of trifoliate leaves, which are typically hairy and have a bluish-green hue. The plant produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Moltkia longiflora is a member of the legume family and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria."
