    "intro": "Micromeria balcanica, commonly known as the Balkan micromeria, is a small, flowering plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, often white or pale yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat endangered species in its native range."
