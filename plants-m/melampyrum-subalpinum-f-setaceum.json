    "intro": "Melampyrum subalpinum f. setaceum, commonly known as the alpine touch-me-not, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while also performing photosynthesis. This subspecies is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, often in open, rocky habitats. The plant's fleshy roots and specialized structures enable it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments."
