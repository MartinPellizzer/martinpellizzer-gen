    "intro": "Minuartia leucocephala, commonly known as the white-flowered sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically forms dense mats on rocky or sandy soils, and its leaves are usually linear and arranged in a rosette pattern. It is adapted to harsh environments, exhibiting frost resistance and efficient water conservation mechanisms. Minuartia leucocephala plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas."
