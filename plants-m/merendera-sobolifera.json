    "intro": "Merendera sobolifera, commonly known as the desert broom. It is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant has small, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in clusters and attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Merendera sobolifera is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
