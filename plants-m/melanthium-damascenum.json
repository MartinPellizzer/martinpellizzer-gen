    "intro": "Melanthium damascenum, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features delicate, nodding flowers that range in color from white to pink, with a distinctive, sweet fragrance. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are softly hairy and often have a bluish tinge. It thrives in moist to wet soils in woodland or swampy areas, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread along stream banks and other moist habitats."
