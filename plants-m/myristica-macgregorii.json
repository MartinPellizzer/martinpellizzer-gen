    "intro": "Myristica macgregorii, commonly known as the MacGregor's nutmeg, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, woody fruits that contain the valuable spice known as nutmeg. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers and has compound leaves with a serrated margin. Its seeds, encased in a hard shell, are used to produce both nutmeg and mace, making it economically significant in the spice trade. The tree thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in dense forest understories."
