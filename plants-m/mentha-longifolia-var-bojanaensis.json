    "intro": "Mentha longifolia var. bojanaensis, commonly known as Bojana's mint, is a rare subspecies of the mint family native to specific regions in the Balkans. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves and small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their refreshing and cooling properties. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically unique species."
