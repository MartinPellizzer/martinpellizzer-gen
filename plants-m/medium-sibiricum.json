    "intro": "Medium sibiricum, commonly known as the Siberian bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the cold regions of Eurasia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of blue to purple bell-shaped flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens in temperate climates. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators."
