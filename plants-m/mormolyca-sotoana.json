    "intro": "Mormolyca sotoana, commonly known as the Sotoan ghost fern, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the cloud forests of Central America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil to flourish. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typically hidden among the foliage. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Mormolyca sotoana is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
