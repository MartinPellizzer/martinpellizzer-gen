    "intro": "Millettia gracilis, commonly known as the slender millettia, is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing flattened seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and shrublands. Due to its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
