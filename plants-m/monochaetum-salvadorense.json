    "intro": "Monochaetum salvadorense, commonly known as the Salvadoran spikegrass, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale green flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in humid lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
