    "intro": "Mitriostigma greenwayi, commonly known as the Greenway's mitriostigma, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its unique floral structures. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in cloud forests, where it thrives on nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, with a smooth surface, and it produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change."
