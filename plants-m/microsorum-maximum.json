    "intro": "Microsorum maximum, commonly known as the giant chain sword, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, narrow, and sword-like leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in the roots of submerged trees. Its rhizomes form dense mats, which help stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for small aquatic organisms. Microsorum maximum is popular in aquariums due to its attractive appearance and ease of care."
