    "intro": "Mammillaria lasiacantha f. wohlschlageri, commonly known as the Wohlschlager's mammillaria, is a rare and striking cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in white to pale green tubercles, which are adorned with prominent radial spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and delicate nature, it is often cultivated in controlled environments."
