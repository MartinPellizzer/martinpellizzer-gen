    "intro": "Melinis chaetophora, commonly known as hairy bluestem, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes and wet meadows. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense stands. Melinis chaetophora is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
