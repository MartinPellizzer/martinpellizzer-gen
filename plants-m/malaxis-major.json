    "intro": "Malaxis major, commonly known as the giant malaxis, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 centimeters in diameter. The plant typically grows in forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, often forming a dense rosette. The flowers are usually greenish-yellow with a distinctive lip, and they bloom during the wet season."
