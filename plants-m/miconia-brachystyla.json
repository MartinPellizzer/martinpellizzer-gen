    "intro": "Miconia brachystyla, commonly known as the short-styled miconia, is a tropical shrub belonging to the Melastomataceae family. It is native to Central and South America, particularly found in humid lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its large, broad leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous minute seeds. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
