    "intro": "Minuartia mesogitana subsp. kotschyana, commonly known as the Kotschyan's rockcress, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the rocky habitats of the eastern Mediterranean. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many flowering plants with small, cruciform flowers. The plant typically produces white or pale yellow flowers with four petals, and its leaves are small, fleshy, and arranged in a rosette pattern. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. This subspecies is notable for its resilience to harsh environmental conditions and its role in stabilizing rocky substrates."
