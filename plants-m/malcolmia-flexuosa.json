    "intro": "Malcolmia flexuosa, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with slender stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Malcolmia flexuosa is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments."
