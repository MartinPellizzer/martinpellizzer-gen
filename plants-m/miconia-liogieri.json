    "intro": "Miconia liogieri, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Atlantic rainforests of Brazil. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 40 cm in diameter, often with a rough, hairy texture on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers, followed by yellow or orange fruits that resemble starfruits in appearance. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other tropical regions for horticultural purposes. However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
