    "intro": "Mimosa mollis, commonly known as the silky mimosa, is a deciduous shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its soft, silvery-gray foliage and delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched. The plant produces small, yellowish-pink flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Mimosa mollis is also known for its sensitive foliage, which responds to touch and light, adding an interactive element to its appearance."
