    "intro": "Micromeles decaisneana, commonly known as the Decaenean mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Loranthaceae. It primarily inhabits the branches of specific host trees, such as those in the genus *Ficus*, in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its small, scale-like leaves. It produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. The berries it bears are typically consumed by birds, which aid in seed dispersal."
