    "intro": "Microchilus uribei, commonly known as the Urib\u00e9's microchilus, is a rare and small flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has small, lance-shaped leaves. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an important subject for botanical research."
