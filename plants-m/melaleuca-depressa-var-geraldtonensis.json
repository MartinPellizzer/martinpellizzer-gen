    "intro": "Melaleuca depressa var. geraldtonensis, commonly known as Geraldton waxwood, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and distinctive, waxy, yellow to red flower spikes that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden environments, making it resilient to coastal conditions. Its flowers attract nectar-feeding birds and insects, contributing to local biodiversity. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
