    "intro": "Miconia granvillei, commonly known as the granville's miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by birds and other animals. Miconia granvillei is often found in humid, lowland forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture. However, it can be invasive in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets."
