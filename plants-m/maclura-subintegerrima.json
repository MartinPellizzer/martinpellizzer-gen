    "intro": "Maclura subintegerrima, commonly known as the yellow wood or yellow hickory, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, light-colored bark that often has a yellowish tinge, especially on younger trees. The leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, typically turning a striking yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by woody, spiny fruits. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and distinctive color, making it a sought-after material in woodworking."
