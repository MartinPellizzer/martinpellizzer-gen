    "intro": "Madorella dissitiflora, commonly known as the crested flame flower, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that consist of numerous small, tubular flowers clustered in a dense, rounded shape. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or terrestrial herb, often found in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually opposite and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly honeyeaters, due to their bright colors and nectar-rich structure."
