    "intro": "Muraltia kraussiana, commonly known as the Cape coral tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and clusters of bright red or orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, round, yellow or orange fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Muraltia kraussiana is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to attract wildlife."
