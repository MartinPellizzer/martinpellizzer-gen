It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, characterized by its small, delicate flowers and succulent leaves. This variant is distinguished by its compact growth habit and pale pink to white blooms that appear in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant adaptation to high-altitude ecosystems."
