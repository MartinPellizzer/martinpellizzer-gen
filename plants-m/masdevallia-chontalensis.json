    "intro": "Masdevallia chontalensis, commonly known as the Chontal Mountain Orchid, is a species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Central America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its intricate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette, helping it retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. The flowers, which can be brightly colored, are adapted for pollination by specific insects, showcasing the plant's evolutionary specialization."
