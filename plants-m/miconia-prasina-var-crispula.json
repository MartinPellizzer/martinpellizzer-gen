    "intro": "Miconia prasina var. crispula, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are fleshy berries that mature to a bright red color, attracting various bird species. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, it is considered an invasive species in some regions."
