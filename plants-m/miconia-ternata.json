    "intro": "Miconia ternata, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that are followed by distinctive, round, red or orange fruits. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types make it an invasive species in many regions. The botanical features of Miconia ternata contribute to its ecological impact and make it a notable plant in tropical botany."
