    "intro": "Myricaria germanica var. bracteata, commonly known as the bracted myricaria, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered with a fine layer of wax, aiding in water retention. This species is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
