    "intro": "Melaleuca linariifolia var. typica, commonly known as the narrow-leaf paperbark, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, papery bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bottle-shaped flowers that are typically red or pink, which bloom in winter and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a smooth surface and a slight waxy coating. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often found in heathlands and open forests."
