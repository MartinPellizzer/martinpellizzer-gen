    "intro": "Macrozamia conferta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cycad, is a slow-growing, evergreen cycad native to eastern Australia. It features a stout, unbranched trunk with a fibrous, spongy bark and a crown of stiff, dark green, narrow leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with male and female cones typically on separate plants. It is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland rainforest areas. Due to its slow growth and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
