    "intro": "Maerua triphylla, commonly known as the three-leafed maerua, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its small, three-lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its woody stems are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Maerua triphylla is also valued for its role in preventing soil erosion in degraded landscapes."
