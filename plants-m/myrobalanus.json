    "intro": "Myrobalanus, commonly known as the Indian date palm, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Arecaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly India, and includes several species such as Myrobalanus edulis. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. Its fruits, which are typically small and round, are edible and have a sweet, chewy texture similar to dates. Myrobalanus is often cultivated for its fruit and is also valued for its ornamental appearance."
