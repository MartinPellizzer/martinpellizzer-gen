    "intro": "Melilotus hirsutus, commonly known as hairy melilot, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia, and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant has hairy stems and leaves, giving it its common name. Hairy melilot is sometimes used in traditional medicine and can also serve as a forage plant for livestock."
