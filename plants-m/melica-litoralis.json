    "intro": "Melica litoralis, commonly known as sea melica, is a flowering plant species native to coastal regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with tiny, spikelet-like flowers that are typically green or pale blue in color. It thrives in saline or coastal environments, demonstrating a high tolerance for salt and wind exposure. Melica litoralis is often found in dunes, salt marshes, and other coastal habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
