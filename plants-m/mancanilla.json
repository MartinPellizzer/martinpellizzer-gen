It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is known for its large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant has smooth, dark green leaves and produces small, red berries that contain the seeds. Mancanilla is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. Its blooming cycle is closely tied to the lunar calendar, making it a symbol of mystery and beauty in local cultures."
