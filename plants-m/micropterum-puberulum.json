    "intro": "Micropterum puberulum, commonly known as the silky sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically features small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Micropterum puberulum is adapted to withstand drought conditions and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
