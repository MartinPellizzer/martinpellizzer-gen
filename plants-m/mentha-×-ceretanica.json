    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 ceretanica, commonly known as the hybrid mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant that belongs to the Lamiaceae family. It is a cross between Mentha longifolia (spearmint) and Mentha piperita (peppermint), resulting in a plant with a strong, aromatic scent. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a slightly serrated edge, while the flowers are small and tubular, often purple in color. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is widely cultivated for its essential oils, which are used in aromatherapy, medicine, and flavoring."
