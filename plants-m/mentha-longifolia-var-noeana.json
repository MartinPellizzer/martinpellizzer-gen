It features slender, aromatic stems that often grow in dense clusters, and its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in whorls along the stem, typically from late spring to early summer. Its essential oils, rich in menthol and other compounds, contribute to its strong, cooling scent and medicinal properties. This variety is valued for its use in herbal teas, aromatherapy, and as a natural remedy for digestive and respiratory ailments."
