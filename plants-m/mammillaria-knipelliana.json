It is a small, globular cactus with a short, stout stem and is covered in white to pale green tubercles. The plant typically produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
