    "intro": "Mimosa houstoniana, commonly known as the Houston mimosas, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a characteristic known as nyctinasty. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. The plant's rapid growth and adaptability make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
