It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to two meters in length, providing a dramatic visual impact. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, which bloom throughout the year. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Due to its size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and large indoor spaces."
