    "intro": "Medicago intertexta subsp. ciliaris, commonly known as the narrow-leafed medick, is a perennial legume native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, trifoliate leaves with hairy margins and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, showing a preference for well-drained soils. It has a deep taproot system, which allows it to thrive in drier conditions. Medicago intertexta subsp. ciliaris is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects."
