It is characterized by its small, evergreen shrub form, with dense foliage and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, dark berries that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland and heathland habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of undisturbed ecosystems."
