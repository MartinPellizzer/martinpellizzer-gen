    "intro": "Macropanax rosthornii, commonly known as the Rosthorn's giant arum, is a rare and striking plant native to the rainforests of New Guinea. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink, attracting various pollinators such as beetles and flies. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often reaching several feet in length, contributing to its dramatic appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Macropanax rosthornii is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
