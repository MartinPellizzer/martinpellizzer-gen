    "intro": "Mimosa roemeriana, commonly known as the yellow mimosa, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that turn a striking yellow color when touched, a response triggered by the plant's sensitive thigmonastic movement. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are followed by fluffy, white seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its unique foliage and adaptability, Mimosa roemeriana is often cultivated in warm climates for its aesthetic appeal."
