    "intro": "Magnolia chiriquiensis, commonly known as the Chiriqu\u00ed magnolia, is a species native to Central America, particularly found in Panama and Costa Rica. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The flowers, which bloom in the spring, are typically white or pale pink and are clustered in large, showy inflorescences. The tree produces woody capsules that contain seeds, and it prefers well-drained soils in humid, tropical climates. It is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
