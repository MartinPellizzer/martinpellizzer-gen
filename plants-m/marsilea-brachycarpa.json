    "intro": "Marsilea brachycarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited water clover, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are divided into four lobes, resembling a clover leaf. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its reproductive structures include small, yellowish fruits that develop from the leaf bases. Marsilea brachycarpa plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration."
