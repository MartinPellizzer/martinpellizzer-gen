    "intro": "Merendera montana subsp. bulbocodioides, commonly known as the mountain merendera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Andes Mountains. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. It has a fibrous root system and is adapted to rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
