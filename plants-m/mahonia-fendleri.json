    "intro": "Mahonia fendleri, commonly known as the desert barberry, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features compound leaves that are typically gray-green in color and covered in a powdery white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife. It is well adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade. Mahonia fendleri is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
