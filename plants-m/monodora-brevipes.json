    "intro": "Monodora brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes plants such as mango and cashew. The tree is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in whorls. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, while the fruit is a fleshy, yellowish drupe with a single seed. The plant is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in furniture and carving, though it is also threatened by habitat loss."
