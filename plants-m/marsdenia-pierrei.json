The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by follicles containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in secondary forests and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
