    "intro": "Myroxylon buxifolium var. pauciflorum, commonly known as the rare African satinwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to parts of Africa. It features dense, glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by dark purple berries. It is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional crafts and as a source of natural dye. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
