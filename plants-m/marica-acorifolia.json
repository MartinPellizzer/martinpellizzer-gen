    "intro": "Marica acorifolia, commonly known as the Florida waterleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Violaceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant, violet-colored flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps in reducing water loss. Marica acorifolia is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as wetlands and forest floors."
