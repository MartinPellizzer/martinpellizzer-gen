It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to blue. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in areas with high sunlight exposure. Its foliage consists of opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
