    "intro": "Mappa chatiniana, commonly known as the red-flowered mountain orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its vibrant red petals and a unique, intricate floral structure typical of the Orchidaceae family. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Its growth is slow, and it produces small, delicate leaves with a waxy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Mappa chatiniana is considered a conservation concern."
