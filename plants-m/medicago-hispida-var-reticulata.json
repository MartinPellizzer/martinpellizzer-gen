It is characterized by its hairy stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it valuable in soil enrichment and as a cover crop. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Its seeds are often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and rapid growth."
