    "intro": "Manglilla ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty manglilla, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, reddish-brown stems and lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically from spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value."
