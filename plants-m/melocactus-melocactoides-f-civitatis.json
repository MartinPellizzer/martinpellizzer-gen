It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem and the presence of a single, prominent areole with spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is adapted to the arid and rocky environments of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
