    "intro": "Miconia subcordata, commonly known as the red miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a potential weed in some regions."
