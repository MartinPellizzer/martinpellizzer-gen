    "intro": "Malus communis var. depressa, commonly known as the dwarf apple tree, is a compact cultivar of the apple tree species. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, making it suitable for small spaces or as a decorative plant. The plant produces small, ornamental flowers in spring, followed by edible fruits that are typically smaller than those of standard apple trees. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. This variety is often valued for its hardiness and ability to adapt to various climates."
