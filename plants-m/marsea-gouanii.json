    "intro": "Marsea gouanii, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, feathery foliage and long, pendulous clusters of yellow flowers that bloom throughout the warm seasons. The plant thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its rapid growth rate makes it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping and reforestation projects. The leaves are typically glossy and dark green, contributing to its aesthetic appeal in both natural and cultivated settings."
