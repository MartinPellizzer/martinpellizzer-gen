    "intro": "Mimosa lacerans, commonly known as the Brazilian mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant is known for its rapid leaf movement in response to touch, a phenomenon called thigmonastic response. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in open woodlands and savannas. The seeds of Mimosa lacerans are enclosed in hairy, pod-like structures that aid in seed dispersal."
