    "intro": "Mastersia cleistocarpa, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its unique, pale green, almost translucent flowers that bloom in a closed, or \"cleistocarpic,\" state, making it difficult to observe in full bloom. The plant's foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its humid, shaded habitat. Mastersia cleistocarpa is a terrestrial orchid that thrives in moist, well-drained soils under the canopy of dense vegetation. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
