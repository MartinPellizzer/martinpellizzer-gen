    "intro": "Myosotis arvensis var. versicolor, commonly known as the variable water violet, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that range in color from blue to purple and occasionally pink or white, depending on environmental conditions. The plant typically grows in moist, shady habitats such as meadows, woodlands, and stream banks. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and often branched. This variation in flower color makes it an interesting subject for botanical study and a valuable addition to gardens with wet soil conditions."
