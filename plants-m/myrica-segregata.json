    "intro": "Myrica segregata, commonly known as the wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, waxy leaves that are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fragrant oils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by dark blue, waxy berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. Myrica segregata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions."
