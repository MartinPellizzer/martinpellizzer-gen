    "intro": "Micromeria marifolia, commonly known as desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and drought-tolerant adaptations. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-suited to harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Micromeria marifolia plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native insects in its native range."
