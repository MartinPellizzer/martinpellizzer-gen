    "intro": "Metrosideros gracilis, commonly known as the slender flame tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and distinctive, showy red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring. The leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The tree produces small, woody fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to coastal and sunny environments."
