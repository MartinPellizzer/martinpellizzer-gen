    "intro": "Meibomia podocarpa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain several seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used in furniture and carving. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species."
