    "intro": "Mandragora officinalis, commonly known as the deadly nightshade, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark purple berries and bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant contains toxic alkaloids, including atropine and scopolamine, which have historically been used in medicine and magic. Its roots, which resemble a human figure, have been the subject of folklore and superstition. Due to its toxicity, it is often cultivated in controlled environments for research or medicinal purposes."
