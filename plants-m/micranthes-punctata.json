    "intro": "Micranthes punctata, commonly known as the spotted peppergrass, is a perennial herb native to North America. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils in open habitats such as meadows and prairies. The plant features small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slightly hairy texture. Micranthes punctata is characterized by its distinctive seed pods that split open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal."
