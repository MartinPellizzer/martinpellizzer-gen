It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal forests and mangroves. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
