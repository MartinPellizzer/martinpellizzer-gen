    "intro": "Mikania buchtienii, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a vigorous vine native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating and produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and runners. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions."
