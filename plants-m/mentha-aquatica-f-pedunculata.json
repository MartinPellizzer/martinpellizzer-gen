It is a perennial herb characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in moist or aquatic environments such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. Its fragrant, dark green leaves are often used in herbal teas and traditional medicine. The small, pale blue to purple flowers appear in whorls along the stems and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
