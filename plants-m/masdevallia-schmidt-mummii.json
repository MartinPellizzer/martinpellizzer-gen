    "intro": "Masdevallia schmidt-mummii, commonly known as the Schmidth-Mumm's masdevallia, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its vibrant, intricate flowers that often display a mix of red, orange, and yellow hues. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks in its natural habitat. Its delicate, strap-like leaves are adapted to absorb moisture from the humid, misty environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
