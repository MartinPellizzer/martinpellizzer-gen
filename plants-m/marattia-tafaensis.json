    "intro": "Marattia tafaensis, commonly known as the Tafa fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Marattiaceae and is characterized by its large, compound fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a thick, unbranched trunk that is covered with a layer of dead fronds, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its reproductive structures, known as soruses, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Marattia tafaensis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along riverbanks."
