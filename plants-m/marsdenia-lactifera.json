    "intro": "Marsdenia lactifera, commonly known as the milky milkvine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its climbing habit and opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by fleshy, orange-red berries. Its latex is milky and can be toxic, making it important to handle with care. Marsdenia lactifera is valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
