    "intro": "Mammillaria voburnensis var. collinsii, commonly known as the Collins' nipple cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular stem covered in small, white to pale green tubercles, which give it a distinctive, rounded appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its slow growth and low maintenance requirements. This variety is prized for its unique shape and ornamental value in arid landscapes."
