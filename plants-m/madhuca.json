    "intro": "Madhuca, commonly known as the candlewood or tallow tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Sapotaceae. It consists of over 100 species, primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. The plants are characterized by their evergreen leaves, which are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. Many species produce small, fragrant flowers that are often white or yellow, followed by fruits that contain a single seed. The genus is notable for its ecological and economic importance, particularly in providing shade and timber."
