    "intro": "Myrtus uliginosa, commonly known as bog myrtle, is a shrub native to wet, acidic environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, dark blue berries and aromatic, needle-like leaves that emit a subtle, pleasant scent. The plant thrives in peat bogs and other waterlogged soils, where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing the ecosystem. Its leaves contain compounds such as myrtenol and cineole, which contribute to its medicinal and aromatic properties. Historically, it has been used in traditional medicine and as a source of fragrance in perfumery."
