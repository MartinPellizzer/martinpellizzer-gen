    "intro": "Microlicia imbricata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf hibiscus, is a tropical plant native to parts of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, with five petals and a prominent yellow throat. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Microlicia imbricata is also known for its ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative propagation, making it a common weed in agricultural areas."
