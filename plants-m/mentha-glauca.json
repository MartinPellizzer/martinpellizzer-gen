The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Mentha glauca is known for its aromatic, minty scent and is often used in herbal teas and traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun."
