    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 veneta, commonly known as peppermint, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Mentha spicata (spearmint) and Mentha piperita (true peppermint). It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its square stems, opposite leaves, and dense clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant is native to Europe and has been naturalized in various parts of the world. Peppermint is widely cultivated for its aromatic oils, which are used in aromatherapy, medicine, and food products. Its rapid growth and spreading habit make it an effective ground cover but also a potential weed in gardens."
