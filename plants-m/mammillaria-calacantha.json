    "intro": "Mammillaria calacantha, commonly known as the horned cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, spherical fruits. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
