    "intro": "Macrothelypteris setigera, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a large, tropical fern native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach lengths of up to 6 meters. The plant has a distinctive, clustered rhizome system that supports its extensive growth. Its fronds are bi-lobed and have a leathery texture, with fertile fronds displaying spore-producing structures on the undersides. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests and along stream banks."
