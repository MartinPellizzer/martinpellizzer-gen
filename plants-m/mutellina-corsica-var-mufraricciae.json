It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels. Its leaves are finely divided and emit a mild, spicy odor when crushed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species within its native range."
