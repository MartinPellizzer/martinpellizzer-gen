    "intro": "Mentha aquatica f. caput-medusae, commonly known as the \"Queen's crown\" mint, is a distinctive hybrid form of water mint. It is characterized by its striking, rosette-like arrangement of leaves that resemble a crown, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a strong, peppermint-like aroma. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for both its beauty and aromatic properties."
