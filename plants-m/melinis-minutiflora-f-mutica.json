    "intro": "Melinis minutiflora f. mutica, commonly known as the buffelgrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny white to pale green flowers. The plant is adapted to dry conditions and can thrive in poor soils, making it invasive in some areas. Its rapid growth and high seed production contribute to its ecological impact. It is often found in disturbed habitats and can outcompete native vegetation."
