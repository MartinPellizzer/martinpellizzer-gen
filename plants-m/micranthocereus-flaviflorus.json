    "intro": "Micranthocereus flaviflorus, commonly known as the yellow-flowered cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a low-growing, columnar cactus with a ribbed stem and spines that are typically white or yellow. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique flowering display."
