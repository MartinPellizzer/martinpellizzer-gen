    "intro": "Miconia labiakiana, commonly known as the Labiakiana miconia, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are often surrounded by bright red bracts, which are modified leaves used to attract pollinators. Miconia labiakiana is part of the Melastomataceae family and is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions where it has been introduced."
