    "intro": "Malvastrum coccineum var. grossulariifolium, commonly known as the showy malva, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking red, pink, or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, resembling the leaves of the gooseberry plant, hence its scientific name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The showy malva is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
