    "intro": "Manfreda parva, commonly known as the dwarf manfreda, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
