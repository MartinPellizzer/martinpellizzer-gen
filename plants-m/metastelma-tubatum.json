    "intro": "Metastelma tubatum, commonly known as the tuberous metaphyllum, is a unique plant species characterized by its distinctive tuberous roots. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically in shades of white and green, and bloom during the wet season. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Metastelma tubatum is considered a delicate and endangered species."
