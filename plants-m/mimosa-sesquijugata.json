    "intro": "Mimosa sesquijugata, commonly known as the yellow mimosa, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are divided into fine, feathery segments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy plant in USDA hardiness zones 7 through 10. The leaves are sensitive to touch, curling up when disturbed, a trait that gives the plant its common name."
