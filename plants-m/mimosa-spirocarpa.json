    "intro": "Mimosa spirocarpa, commonly known as the spiral acacia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces long, spiral-shaped pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Mimosa spirocarpa is also known for its sensitive leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait shared with other species in the Mimosa genus."
