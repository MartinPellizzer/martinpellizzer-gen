It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers clustered in spikes, which bloom in spring. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating. It is typically found in coastal and sandy soils, and is adapted to tolerate salt spray and drought conditions."
