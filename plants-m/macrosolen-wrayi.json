It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 centimeters in diameter, typically in shades of purple and white. Its foliage consists of broad, strap-like leaves that are often used in horticultural displays.
