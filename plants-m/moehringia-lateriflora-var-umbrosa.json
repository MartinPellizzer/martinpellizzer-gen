    "intro": "Moehringia lateriflora var. umbrosa, commonly known as the shade-loving willow-herb, is a low-growing perennial herb native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters along the stems, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered with fine hairs. This variety is adapted to woodland and streamside habitats, where it thrives in cool, damp conditions."
