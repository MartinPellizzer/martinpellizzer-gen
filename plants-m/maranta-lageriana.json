    "intro": "Maranta lageriana, commonly known as the prayer plant, is a tropical flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, colorful foliage that changes throughout the day, with leaves folding upwards at night, a behavior known as nyctinasty. The plant belongs to the Marantaceae family and is prized for its ornamental value in both indoor and outdoor settings. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and can display shades of red, pink, and green, depending on the variety. Maranta lageriana thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture and humidity to flourish."
