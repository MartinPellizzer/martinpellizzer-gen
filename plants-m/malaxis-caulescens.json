    "intro": "Malaxis caulescens, commonly known as the slender malaxis, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest habitats, often on the forest floor or in rocky crevices. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption in poor soil conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
