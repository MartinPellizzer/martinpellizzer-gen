It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers. The plant produces distinctive, velvety, heart-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. Its climbing habit makes it suitable for vertical gardening, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments.
