    "intro": "Macrozamia montana, commonly known as the mountain cycad, is a species of cycad native to Australia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate to subtropical climates. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
