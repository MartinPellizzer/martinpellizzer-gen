    "intro": "Muhlenbergia racemosa var. ramosa, commonly known as the silky muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and delicate, panicle-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is well adapted to arid environments. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value. The variety ramosa is distinguished by its more branched inflorescences compared to the typical form."
