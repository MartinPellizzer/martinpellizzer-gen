It features small, fleshy, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
