    "intro": "Melocactus intortus, commonly known as the twisted melon cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, thick stem that often curves or twists, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on the upper part of the stem. Its spines are relatively short and can be either straight or slightly curved. Melocactus intortus is adapted to survive in extreme desert conditions with minimal water and high sunlight exposure."
