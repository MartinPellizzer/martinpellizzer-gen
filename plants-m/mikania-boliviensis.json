    "intro": "Mikania boliviensis, commonly known as the Bolivian hemp vine, is a climbing plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its rapid growth and potential invasiveness, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
