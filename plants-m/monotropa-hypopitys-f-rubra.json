    "intro": "Monotropa hypopitys f. rubra, commonly known as the red mistletoe, is a unique parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host trees for nutrients. It is found primarily in the eastern United States, growing in the canopy of hardwood forests. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that are often clustered together, and its berries are red, hence the common name. It has a distinctive appearance with its delicate, vine-like structure and is often associated with a symbiotic relationship with certain fungi. Botanically, it is classified as a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes other parasitic and hemiparasitic plants."
