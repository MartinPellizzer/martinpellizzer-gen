    "intro": "Milicia regia, commonly known as the African shea tree, is a large, deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its thick, buttressed roots and smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The tree produces yellowish-green flowers and oval, woody pods that contain edible seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a rough, textured surface. Milicia regia is valued for its shea nuts, which are used to produce shea butter, an important ingredient in cosmetics and traditional medicines."
