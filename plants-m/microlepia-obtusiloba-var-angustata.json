    "intro": "Microlepia obtusiloba var. angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Microlepia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions near water bodies. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in aquatic habitats."
