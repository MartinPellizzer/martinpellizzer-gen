    "intro": "Mahonia gracilipes var. rhombicus, commonly known as the rhombic mahonia, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of southeastern China. It features compound leaves with elliptical, leathery leaflets that are often arranged in a dense, upright manner. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are clustered in upright panicles and are followed by blue-black berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its evergreen foliage and seasonal floral display."
