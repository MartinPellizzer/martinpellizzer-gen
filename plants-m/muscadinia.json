These plants are native to the southeastern United States and are characterized by their thick-skinned, seeded berries. Muscadine grapes are known for their high levels of resveratrol and other antioxidants, which contribute to their unique flavor and health benefits. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a rough texture, and the vines are vigorous climbers. They thrive in warm climates and are often cultivated for both culinary and medicinal purposes."
