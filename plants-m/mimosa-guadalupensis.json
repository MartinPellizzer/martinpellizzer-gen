    "intro": "Mimosa guadalupensis, commonly known as the Guadalupe mimosa, is a shrub native to the Southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are composed of multiple pairs of small, feathery leaflets. The plant produces yellow, spherical flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Mimosa guadalupensis is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant once established."
