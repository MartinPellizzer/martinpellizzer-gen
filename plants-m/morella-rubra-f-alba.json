    "intro": "Morella rubra f. alba, commonly known as white waxwood, is a rare and distinctive variant of the sweetgum tree. It is characterized by its white to pale yellow bark, which contrasts with the typical reddish-brown bark of the species. The plant produces small, inconspicuous green flowers that are clustered in catkins, typical of the Nyssaceae family. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin. This form is often found in moist, acidic soils and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance."
