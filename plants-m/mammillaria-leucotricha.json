    "intro": "Mammillaria leucotricha, commonly known as the white-haired hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly bristles that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for succulent collections."
