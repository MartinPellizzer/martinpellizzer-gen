    "intro": "Myrica rotundifolia, commonly known as the wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and small, elliptical leaves that are usually covered in a whitish waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into dark blue, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. Myrica rotundifolia is also valued for its aromatic foliage and is used in traditional medicine and as a source of candle wax."
