    "intro": "Masdevallia aureoportensis, commonly known as the Golden Porte\u00f1o orchid, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with intricate, lance-shaped leaves and delicate, spurred flowers. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange blooms with a distinctive golden lip, which are typically arranged in a loose inflorescence. It thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity, often growing in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
