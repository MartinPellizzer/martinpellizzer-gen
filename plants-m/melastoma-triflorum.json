    "intro": "Melastoma triflorum, commonly known as the three-flowered melastoma, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melastomataceae. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically clustered in umbels and feature five petals, often in shades of pink or red, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal."
