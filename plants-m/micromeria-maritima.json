It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to saline and arid environments. It is often found in dunes and along the shores, where it plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in certain areas."
