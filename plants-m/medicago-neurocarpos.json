    "intro": "Medicago neurocarpos, commonly known as the narrow-leafed clover, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a deep root system, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and arid conditions. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen. Its seeds are small and can remain viable in the soil for several years."
