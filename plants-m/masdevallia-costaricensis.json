    "intro": "Masdevallia costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican masdevallia, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate, often colorful floral structures. The plant typically features long, slender stems with clustered flowers that can range in color from white to pink and purple. Its leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to conserve moisture in its natural habitat. This orchid thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake."
