    "intro": "Microtatorchis oreophila, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to high-altitude regions. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers with vibrant colors. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapting to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
