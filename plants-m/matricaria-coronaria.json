    "intro": "Matricaria coronaria, commonly known as chamomile, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its daisy-like yellow flowers with white ray florets, which bloom in the summer months. The plant has a creeping or upright growth habit, with linear, aromatic leaves that are often used in herbal teas. Chamomile is known for its medicinal properties, particularly its calming effects due to the presence of compounds like bisabolol and chamazulene. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and herbal cultivation."
