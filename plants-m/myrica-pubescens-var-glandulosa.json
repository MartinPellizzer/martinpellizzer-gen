    "intro": "Myrica pubescens var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular wax myrtle, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, glandular hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by dark blue, waxy berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along stream banks. The glandular hairs on its leaves and stems contribute to its unique botanical features and ecological role."
