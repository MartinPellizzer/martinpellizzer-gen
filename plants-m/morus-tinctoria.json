    "intro": "Morus tinctoria, commonly known as the Indian mulberry, is a small deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, aggregate fruits that turn from green to red as they mature. The plant is notable for its ability to produce a deep red dye from its bark and leaves, which has been historically used in textile industries. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. The tree is also valued for its role in traditional medicine and as a source of food for silkworms."
