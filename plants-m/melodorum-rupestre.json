    "intro": "Melodorum rupestre, commonly known as the rock melon, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a low-growing perennial with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Melodorum rupestre is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a houseplant."
