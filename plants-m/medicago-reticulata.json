    "intro": "Medicago reticulata, commonly known as the honey vetch, is a perennial legume native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a deep root system, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for erosion control. It is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, improving fertility for subsequent crops. Its fibrous stems and seed pods contribute to its role in forage and wildlife habitat."
