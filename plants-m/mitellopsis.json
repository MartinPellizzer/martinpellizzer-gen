    "intro": "Mitellopsis, commonly known as the yellow wood sorrel, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to the Americas. These plants are characterized by their trifoliate leaves and small, yellow, pea-like flowers. They typically grow in moist, wooded areas and are often found in the understory of forests. Mitellopsis species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in native plant gardens."
