    "intro": "Miconia hirticaulis, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and distinctive hairy stems that give it its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia hirticaulis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it an invasive species in some regions."
