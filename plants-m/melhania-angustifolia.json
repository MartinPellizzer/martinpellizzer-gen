    "intro": "Melhania angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf melhania, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
