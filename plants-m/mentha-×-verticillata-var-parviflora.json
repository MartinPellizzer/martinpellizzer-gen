It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves and small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in whorls along the stems. This variety thrives in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. Its leaves are often used in herbal teas and traditional medicine for their cooling and digestive properties.
