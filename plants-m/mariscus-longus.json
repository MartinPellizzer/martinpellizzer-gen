    "intro": "Mariscus longus, commonly known as the long-stemmed marsh plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant features elongated, slender stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, with small, lance-shaped leaves arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female inflorescences, and it relies on wind pollination. Mariscus longus plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
