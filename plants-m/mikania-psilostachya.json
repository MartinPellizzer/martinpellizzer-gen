It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in the morning. It is often found in moist, wooded areas and can grow up to several meters in length. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in some regions."
