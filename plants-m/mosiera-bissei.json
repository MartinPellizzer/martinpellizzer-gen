It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its velvety, heart-shaped leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, often with a compact, bushy growth habit. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Mosiera bissei is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
