    "intro": "Miconia scabrosa, commonly known as the rough miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are often covered in small, rough bumps, giving it a textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia scabrosa is known for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its rapid growth and invasive potential have made it a concern in some regions where it is introduced outside its native range."
