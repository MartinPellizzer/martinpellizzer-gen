    "intro": "Morenoa, commonly known as the New Zealand flax, is a genus of flowering plants native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Asphodelaceae and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, strap-shaped leaves. The plant is known for its fibrous bark, which has been traditionally used by M\u0101ori for making garments and baskets. Morenoa species typically grow in coastal and lowland areas, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. They play an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
