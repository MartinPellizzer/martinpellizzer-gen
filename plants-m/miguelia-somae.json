    "intro": "Miguelia somae, commonly known as the Somalian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on acacia trees in the arid regions of Somalia. It has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or pink flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis. Its berries are red and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Miguelia somae plays a unique ecological role in its native habitat, supporting local biodiversity."
