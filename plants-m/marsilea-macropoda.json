    "intro": "Marsilea macropoda, commonly known as water clover, is a floating aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water surface. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are typically submerged, followed by spore-bearing structures called sporocarps. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Marsilea macropoda is often used in water gardens and is also an indicator species for water quality."
