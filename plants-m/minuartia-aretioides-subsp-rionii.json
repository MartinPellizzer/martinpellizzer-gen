    "intro": "Minuartia aretioides subsp. rionii, commonly known as the Rion Mountain Sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are usually narrow and succulent. It is often found in open habitats such as screes, limestone outcrops, and gravelly slopes. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
