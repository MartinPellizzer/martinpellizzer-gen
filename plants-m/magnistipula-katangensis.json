    "intro": "Magnistipula katangensis, commonly known as the Katanga mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to Central Africa. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its yellowish-green foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant attaches itself to the stems of its host trees, such as Ficus and Moraceae species, through specialized roots called haustoria. It relies on its host for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis to some extent. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
