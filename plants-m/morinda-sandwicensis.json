It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its woody structure and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces bright red, fleshy berries that are edible and contain a single seed. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in native forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
