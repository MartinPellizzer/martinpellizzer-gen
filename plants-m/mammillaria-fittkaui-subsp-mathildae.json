    "intro": "Mammillaria fittkaui subsp. mathildae, commonly known as the Mathilde's nipple cactus, is a small, solitary cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular stem covered in white to yellowish tubercles, which are modified stems that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its greenish-gray body. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is a prized species among cactus enthusiasts."
