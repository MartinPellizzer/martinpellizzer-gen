    "intro": "Micromeria varia f. rupestris, commonly known as the rock micromeria, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern California and northern Baja California. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and yellow flowers. The plant has a compact, cushion-like growth form, adapted to survive in hot, dry environments. Its fleshy stems and leaves store water, making it well-suited for rocky, well-drained soils. It is often found growing on limestone outcrops and in coastal sage scrub habitats."
