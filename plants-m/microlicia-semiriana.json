    "intro": "Microlicia semiriana, commonly known as the red-leaf microlicia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, glossy leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in the understory of rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
