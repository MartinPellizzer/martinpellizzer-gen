    "intro": "Mephitidia oligantha, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces delicate, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots are specialized to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Mephitidia oligantha is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
