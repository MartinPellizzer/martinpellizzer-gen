It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along its stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by fruit that contains several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
