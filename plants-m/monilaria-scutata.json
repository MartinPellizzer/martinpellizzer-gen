    "intro": "Monilaria scutata, commonly known as the scutate lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Graphidaceae. It is characterized by its crustose thallus, which adheres tightly to the substrate, typically found on bark or rock surfaces. The lichen has a dark, almost black appearance with a slightly granular texture, and it often forms dense patches. It is widely distributed in temperate regions and is commonly found in forested areas with high humidity. Monilaria scutata plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and serves as an indicator species for environmental conditions."
