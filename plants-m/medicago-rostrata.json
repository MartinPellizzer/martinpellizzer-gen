    "intro": "Medicago rostrata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed clover, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are narrow and often have a distinct yellow or white marking. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Medicago rostrata is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a useful plant in agricultural settings. It is also used in erosion control and as a forage crop for livestock."
