    "intro": "Mariscus ekmanii, commonly known as the Ekman's mariscus, is a rare and unique member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring. Native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa, this plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Its growth habit is low and compact, with a mat-forming structure that helps it survive in harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Mariscus ekmanii is considered a vulnerable species."
