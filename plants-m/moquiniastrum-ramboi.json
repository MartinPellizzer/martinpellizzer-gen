    "intro": "Moquiniastrum ramboi, commonly known as the swamp milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically green with a slight reddish tinge on the underside. The plant produces showy, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators such as butterflies and bees. It thrives in moist, poorly drained soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Moquiniastrum ramboi plays an important ecological role by supporting native insect populations and providing habitat for aquatic life."
