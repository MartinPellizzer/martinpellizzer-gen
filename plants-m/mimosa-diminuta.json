    "intro": "Mimosa diminuta, commonly known as the dwarf sensitive plant, is a small, herbaceous species native to South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for container gardening. Due to its sensitive nature and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in warm climates."
