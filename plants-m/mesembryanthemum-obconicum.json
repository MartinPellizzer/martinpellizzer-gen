    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum obconicum, commonly known as the Cape marigold, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, often blue or purple-tinged leaves that are adapted to store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often in response to sunlight. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its resilience and ornamental value make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
