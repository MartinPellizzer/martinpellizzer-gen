    "intro": "Mammillaria villifera var. cirrosa, commonly known as the hairy nipple cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in white, woolly bristles that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-draining soil with minimal water. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and ease of care."
