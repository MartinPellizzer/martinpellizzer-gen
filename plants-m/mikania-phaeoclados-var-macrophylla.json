It features heart-shaped leaves with a prominent central vein and serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in loose inflorescences. Its fibrous roots and stems are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain environments."
