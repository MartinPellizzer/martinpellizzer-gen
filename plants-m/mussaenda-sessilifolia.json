    "intro": "Mussaenda sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaved Mussaenda, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of bright yellow flowers surrounded by colorful bracts that resemble petals. The plant has simple, opposite, and often hairy leaves that are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Mussaenda sessilifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
