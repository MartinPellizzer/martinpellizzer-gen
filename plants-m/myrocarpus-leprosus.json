    "intro": "Myrocarpus leprosus, commonly known as the mangrove apple or the red mangrove, is a tropical tree native to the Americas. It is a member of the Combretaceae family and is typically found in brackish water environments along coastal areas. The plant has pneumatophores, which are specialized root structures that facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. Its fruit is a drupe that turns red when mature, containing a single seed. The leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a leathery texture, adapted to withstand salty air and tidal conditions."
