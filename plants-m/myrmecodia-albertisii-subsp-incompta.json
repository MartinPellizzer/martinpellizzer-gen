    "intro": "Myrmecodia albertisii subsp. incompta, commonly known as the ant plant, is a unique epiphytic species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its specialized structures called domatia, which provide shelter for colonies of ants. These ants, in turn, protect the plant from herbivores and help in nutrient acquisition through their waste. The plant's morphology includes a swollen, bulbous stem covered in a dense layer of root-like structures. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches in tropical rainforests."
