    "intro": "Melaleuca acacioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled pattern of white, yellow, and red underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white or yellowish flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture. Melaleuca acacioides is adapted to a variety of soil types and is commonly found in coastal and inland areas."
