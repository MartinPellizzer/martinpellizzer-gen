It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is a cultivar of the common crabapple, Malus halliana. The plant features small, fragrant white or pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible, tart apples in the fall. Its unique pendulous growth habit makes it a popular choice for gardens and parks, where it adds visual interest throughout the growing season."
