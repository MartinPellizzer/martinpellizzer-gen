    "intro": "Metternichia principis var. macrocalyx, commonly known as the large-flowered metternichia, is a rare and striking member of the Acanthaceae family. It is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from deep purple to violet, often with contrasting yellow or white markings. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, velvety texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
