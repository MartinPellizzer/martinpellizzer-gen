    "intro": "Modesta paniculata, commonly known as the sweetgum tree, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant produces small, spherical seed capsules that burst open to release seeds in the spring. Its bark is smooth and light gray, often peeling in thin, papery layers. Modesta paniculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in parks and gardens for its seasonal beauty."
