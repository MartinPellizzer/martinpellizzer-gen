    "intro": "Myrceugenella, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and includes several species that are often mistaken for the related genus Schinus. The plants are shrubs or small trees, characterized by their aromatic leaves and small, red berries that contain seeds. Myrceugenella species are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in a variety of soil types. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and have been introduced to other parts of the world, sometimes becoming invasive."
