    "intro": "Morella diversifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved waxmyrtle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Morella diversifolia thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps and along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland habitats."
