    "intro": "Malus sieboldii f. ascendens, commonly known as the ascending apple or the Japanese flowering crabapple, is a compact, ornamental shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, which distinguishes it from the more spreading forms of its species. The plant produces clusters of small, showy white or pink flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange fruits in the autumn. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a glossy texture and turn vibrant shades of red or orange in the fall. This variety is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
