    "intro": "Malpighia cauliflora, commonly known as the pineapple guava, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It produces edible fruits that are small, fragrant, and have a sweet, tropical flavor. The plant is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and unique, clustered inflorescence that bears both male and female flowers. Its botanical features include showy, red bracts that surround the flowers, which are often mistaken for petals. The fruit develops from the axils of the leaves, a feature typical of cauliflorous plants."
