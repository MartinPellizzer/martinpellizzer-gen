It is a herbaceous perennial that produces large, heart-shaped leaves with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant's underground stems, or tubers, are the primary part used for culinary purposes. These tubers are starchy and have a mild, slightly sweet flavor. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and is often cultivated for its edible roots in tropical regions."
