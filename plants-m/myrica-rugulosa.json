    "intro": "Myrica rugulosa, commonly known as the wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, waxy leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and as a source of fragrant oils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by dark blue, waxy berries that are an important food source for birds and wildlife. Myrica rugulosa thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. Its adaptability and ecological importance make it a valuable plant in both natural and cultivated landscapes."
