    "intro": "Molina prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate molina, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its creeping stems that lie close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. Molina prostrata is adapted to thrive in poor, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and desert habitats."
