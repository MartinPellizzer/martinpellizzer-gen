    "intro": "Morella salicifolia var. goetzei, commonly known as the Goetze's candlewood, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green catkins that are pollinated by wind, and its seeds are enclosed in woody capsules. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This variety is notable for its ecological importance in supporting local wildlife and its historical use by indigenous peoples."
