    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum arenarium, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, which is known for its succulent characteristics and ability to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, often star-shaped flowers that are typically pale yellow or white, blooming during the cooler months. Its leaves are fleshy and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. This species is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
