It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The flowers, which are usually white or pale yellow, bloom in late spring and early summer, attracting various pollinators."
