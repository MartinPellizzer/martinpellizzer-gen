    "intro": "Mesosetum wrightii var. liliputiense, commonly known as the dwarf bluestem, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing perennial with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairies. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for use in native plant gardens and restoration projects."
