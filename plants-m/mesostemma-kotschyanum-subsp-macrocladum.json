    "intro": "Mesostemma kotschyanum subsp. macrocladum, commonly known as the broad-leaf mesostemma, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with low rainfall and high temperatures. The subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for local wildlife."
