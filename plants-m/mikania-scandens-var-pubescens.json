It features heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and wetlands. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
