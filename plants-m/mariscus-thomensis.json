    "intro": "Mariscus thomensis, commonly known as the Tom\u00e9's mariscus, is a flowering plant native to the island of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 in the Gulf of Guinea. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white in color. The plant has a woody stem and produces small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in shaded, moist forest environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
