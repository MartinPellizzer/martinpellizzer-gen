    "intro": "Murdannia medica, commonly known as the medicinal muhly, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often forming dense mats near water bodies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture, and it produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Murdannia medica has been used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties."
