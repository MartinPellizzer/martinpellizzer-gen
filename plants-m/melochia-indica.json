    "intro": "Melochia indica, commonly known as the Indian mallow, is a tropical plant characterized by its large, velvety leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is native to regions across Asia, Africa, and the Americas. The plant is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in cultivated fields due to its adaptability to various soil types. Its seeds are encased in a fibrous, spiny capsule that aids in seed dispersal. Melochia indica is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
