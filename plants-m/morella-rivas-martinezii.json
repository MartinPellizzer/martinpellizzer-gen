    "intro": "Morella rivas-martinezii, commonly known as the Mexican candlewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myricaceae. It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or near freshwater sources. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and the plant produces small, woody fruits that are dispersed by wind. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
