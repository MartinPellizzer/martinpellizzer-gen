    "intro": "Mascagnia strigulosa, commonly known as the desert honeysuckle, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, tubular, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. Mascagnia strigulosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
