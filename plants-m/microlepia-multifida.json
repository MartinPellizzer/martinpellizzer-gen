    "intro": "Microlepia multifida, commonly known as the split fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that give it a delicate and intricate appearance. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting pollinators. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
