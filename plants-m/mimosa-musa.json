    "intro": "Mimosa musa, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a tropical shrub characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is native to South America. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. Its rapid leaf movement is a defensive mechanism against herbivores and environmental stress. Mimosa musa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and adaptability to various climates."
