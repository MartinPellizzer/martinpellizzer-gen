    "intro": "Microchloa annua, commonly known as the annual microchloa, is a small, perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing clumps and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Microchloa annua is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
