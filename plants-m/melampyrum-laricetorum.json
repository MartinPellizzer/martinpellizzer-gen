    "intro": "Melampyrum laricetorum, commonly known as the mountain touch-me-not, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while still performing photosynthesis. This plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its flowers are usually reddish or orange in color, with two lips and five stamens. It is often found in mountainous regions of Europe and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
