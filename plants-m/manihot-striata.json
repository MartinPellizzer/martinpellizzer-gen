    "intro": "Manihot striata, commonly known as the zigzag cassava, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging stems and heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing toxic seeds. While the roots are not typically consumed due to their high levels of cyanogenic glycosides, the plant has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Its adaptability to various soil types makes it a resilient species in tropical regions."
