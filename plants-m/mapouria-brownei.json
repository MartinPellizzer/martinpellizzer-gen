    "intro": "Mapouria brownei, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and fragrant, white flowers. The tree produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed, and its bark is often used in traditional medicine. Mapouria brownei is valued for its hard, aromatic wood, which is used in furniture and carving, though its population is threatened by overharvesting."
