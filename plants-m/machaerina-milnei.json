    "intro": "Machaerina milnei, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flax, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Flax family (Phormiocarpaceae) and is characterized by its narrow, strap-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by cylindrical seed capsules. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions. Machaerina milnei is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use by M\u0101ori for fiber and medicinal purposes."
