    "intro": "Mollugo paniculata, commonly known as carpetweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It features prostrate or ascending stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in branched clusters called panicles, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Mollugo paniculata is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is considered a common weed in many regions."
