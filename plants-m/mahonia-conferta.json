    "intro": "Mahonia conferta, commonly known as the dense mahonia, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with leathery, dark green leaves that are typically elliptic in shape. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in upright racemes. These flowers are followed by blue-black berries that are an important food source for birds. Mahonia conferta is well adapted to partial shade and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
