It is native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil and is characterized by its large, showy, violet-blue bracts that resemble petals. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated margins and produces small, clustered white flowers. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some areas. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds, contributing to its spread and ecological impact."
