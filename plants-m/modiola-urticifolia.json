    "intro": "Modiola urticifolia, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its hollow, hairless stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves covered in fine stinging hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It is often found in shaded woodland areas and along stream banks. Due to its stinging hairs, it is generally avoided by livestock and humans unless cooked or processed."
