    "intro": "Micraira inserta, commonly known as the slender sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub with small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in spring and summer. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with poor soil conditions. Micraira inserta is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sandy soils and its drought tolerance."
