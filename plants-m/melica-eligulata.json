    "intro": "Melica eligulata, commonly known as the narrowleaf brome, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, wet meadows, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments. Melica eligulata is often found in regions with temperate climates and is part of the Poaceae family."
