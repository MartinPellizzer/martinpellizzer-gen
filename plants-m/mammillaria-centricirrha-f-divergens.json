    "intro": "Mammillaria centricirrha f. divergens, commonly known as the divergent mammillaria, is a rare and unique cactus species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, white to pale yellow spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its foliage is typically sparsely covered with areoles, and it thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and endangered species."
