    "intro": "Melandrium intrusum, commonly known as the common sand-wort, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. Melandrium intrusum is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas."
