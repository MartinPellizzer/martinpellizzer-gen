    "intro": "Miconia inaequalifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are often green on the upper surface and lighter in color on the underside. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in wetlands and disturbed areas. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a problematic species in many regions."
