    "intro": "Micromyrtus flaviflora, commonly known as the yellow-flowered myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes eucalyptus and tea trees, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and showy flowers. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and often have a bluish-green hue, while its bark is smooth and peels in thin layers. Micromyrtus flaviflora is adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden coastal environments, making it a resilient and hardy species."
