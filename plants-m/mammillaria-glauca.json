    "intro": "Mammillaria glauca, commonly known as the blue mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem covered in white to blue-gray tubercles, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring or early summer. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water. Due to its unique coloration and compact size, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
