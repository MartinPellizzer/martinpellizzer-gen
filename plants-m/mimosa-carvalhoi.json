    "intro": "Mimosa carvalhoi, commonly known as the Brazilian mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves and spherical, fluffy seed pods. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in response to touch, a trait known as thigmonasty. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Mimosa carvalhoi is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
