    "intro": "Metabolos ferrugineus, commonly known as the rusted metabolos, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive reddish-brown foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a sunny to partially shaded environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
