    "intro": "Microlepia hypolepidoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sword fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its slender, arching fronds with a distinctive bipinnate structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of brown, fibrous roots. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous covering."
