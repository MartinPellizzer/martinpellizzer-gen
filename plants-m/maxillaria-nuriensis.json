    "intro": "Maxillaria nuriensis, commonly known as the Nuri's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that support its foliage and flowers. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Maxillaria nuriensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
