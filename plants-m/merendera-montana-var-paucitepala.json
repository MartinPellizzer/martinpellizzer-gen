    "intro": "Merendera montana var. paucitepala, commonly known as the mountain merendera, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific high-altitude regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, adapted to attract specific pollinators. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soils, often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from climate change and habitat loss."
