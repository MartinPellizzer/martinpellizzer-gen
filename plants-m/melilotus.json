    "intro": "Melilotus, commonly known as sweet clover, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its fragrant, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, and its trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, but has been introduced to many other regions. Melilotus species are often used in agriculture as forage crops and in traditional medicine for their medicinal properties. They also play a role in soil enrichment due to their nitrogen-fixing ability."
