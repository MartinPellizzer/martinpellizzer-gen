    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum macrocarpum, commonly known as the rock rose or evening primrose, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems and produces showy, yellow flowers with prominent stamens that open in the late afternoon. The plant has a compact growth habit and is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it thrives in full sun with well-drained soil. Mesembryanthemum macrocarpum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance."
