    "intro": "Myosotis cespitosa var. neglecta, commonly known as the clustered forget-me-not, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It features slender, creeping stems that form dense mats, often covering the ground with a carpet of small, blue to purple flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. This variant is distinguished by its clustered growth habit and is often found in disturbed or wetland habitats."
