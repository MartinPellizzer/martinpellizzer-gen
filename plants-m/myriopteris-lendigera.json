    "intro": "Myriopteris lendigera, commonly known as the broad-leaf woodsia, is a fern species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are often divided into narrow segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in specialized structures called sorangia. Myriopteris lendigera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings where it can thrive in partial shade."
