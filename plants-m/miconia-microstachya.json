    "intro": "Miconia microstachya, commonly known as the small-stalked miconia, is a tropical plant belonging to the Melastomataceae family. It is native to Central and South America, particularly in regions with humid, warm climates. The plant is characterized by its large, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, clustered flowers with showy pink or red petals, followed by distinctive berries that are a source of seeds. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
