It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant thrives in coastal environments and is adapted to saline and well-drained soils. It is often found in dry, sunny habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal. Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
