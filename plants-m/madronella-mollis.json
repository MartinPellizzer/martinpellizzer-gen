    "intro": "Madronella mollis, commonly known as the slender madrone, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a waxy coating that gives them a distinctive appearance. Madronella mollis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats."
