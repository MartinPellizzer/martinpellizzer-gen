    "intro": "Myrica mairei, commonly known as the Maire's waxwood, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Myricaceae family and is characterized by its wax-coated leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for native birds. Myrica mairei thrives in coastal and lowland forest environments, often growing in well-drained soils. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a habitat and food source for various endemic species."
