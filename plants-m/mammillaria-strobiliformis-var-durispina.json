    "intro": "Mammillaria strobiliformis var. durispina, commonly known as the spiny mammillaria, is a compact cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular to cylindrical stem with prominent, spiny tubercles that give it a rugged appearance. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers during the spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically absent, with spines serving as the primary vegetative structure. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments."
