    "intro": "Miconia elata, commonly known as the red miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a round, fleshy berry that turns red when mature, attracting various birds and mammals. Miconia elata is often found in moist, shaded areas of lowland forests and is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets."
