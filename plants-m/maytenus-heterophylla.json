    "intro": "Maytenus heterophylla, commonly known as the variable mayten, is a species of flowering plant in the family Salicaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. The plant is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with leaves that can be alternate, opposite, or whorled depending on the growth conditions. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in catkins, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Maytenus heterophylla is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
