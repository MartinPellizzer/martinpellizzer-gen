    "intro": "Myriophyllum aquaticum, commonly known as watermilfoil, is an aquatic plant native to North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves that are typically submerged in water. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that emerge above the water surface in the summer. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as lakes and ponds. Watermilfoil can grow rapidly and is often considered an invasive species in non-native regions."
