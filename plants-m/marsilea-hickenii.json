It has four small, heart-shaped leaves that form a rosette at the water's surface. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that develop into dark, spherical fruits. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its unique appearance and habitat make it an important component of Hawaii's freshwater ecosystems."
