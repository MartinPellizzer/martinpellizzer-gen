    "intro": "Manulea rigida, commonly known as the rigid manulea, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright, woody stem and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color, which bloom during the late spring and early summer. Manulea rigida thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cool, moist environment to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
