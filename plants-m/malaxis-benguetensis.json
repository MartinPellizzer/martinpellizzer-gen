It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in clusters. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually linear and grass-like, adapted to its humid, mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
