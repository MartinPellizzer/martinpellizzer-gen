    "intro": "Mikania scandens subsp. periplocifolia, commonly known as the creeping Mikania, is a vigorous climbing herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often pubescent and covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by fluffy, white seed heads. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and forest edges. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes make it an invasive species in many regions."
