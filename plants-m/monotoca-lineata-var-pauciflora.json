    "intro": "Monotoca lineata var. pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered narrowleaf dandelion, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into elongated, slender seed pods. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and along roadsides. Due to its limited flower production, it is less showy compared to other dandelion species."
