    "intro": "Marcetia bahiensis, commonly known as the Bahia marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of northeastern Brazil. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and has a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor in wet soils. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, while its inflorescence consists of a cluster of pale yellow to greenish-white blossoms. Due to habitat loss, Marcetia bahiensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
