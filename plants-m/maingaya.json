    "intro": "Maingaya, commonly known as the \"tiger's claw\" or *Alocasia macrorrhiza*, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clusters. The leaves are also used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
