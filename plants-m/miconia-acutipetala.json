    "intro": "Miconia acutipetala, commonly known as the sharp-leaved miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the Melastomataceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in the Amazon Basin. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. It is often found in moist, shaded understories of tropical forests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some areas."
