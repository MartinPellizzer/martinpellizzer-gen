    "intro": "Marshallia ramosa, commonly known as the hairyleaf coneflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has hairy foliage, which helps to reduce water loss in its native habitat. It is often found in open woods and along woodland edges, thriving in partial shade to full sun. Marshallia ramosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
