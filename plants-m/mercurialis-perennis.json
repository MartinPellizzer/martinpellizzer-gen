It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or marshy areas, often found in temperate regions of Europe and Asia. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually heart-shaped or ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. The plant is also known for its ability to tolerate waterlogged soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
