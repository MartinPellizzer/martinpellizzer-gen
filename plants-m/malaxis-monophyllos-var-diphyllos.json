    "intro": "Malaxis monophyllos var. diphyllos, commonly known as the two-leaf orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring two distinct leaf types on the same plant\u2014one basal and one cauline. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in a spike, and it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species. Its botanical significance lies in its morphological variation and ecological niche within Mediterranean ecosystems."
