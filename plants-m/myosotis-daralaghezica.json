It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its delicate blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountainous forests and meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy texture, while its stems are upright and slender. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
