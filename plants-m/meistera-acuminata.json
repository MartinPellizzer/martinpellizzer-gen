    "intro": "Meistera acuminata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in the leaf axils. Meistera acuminata is an annual herb that thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils. Its rapid growth and prolific seed production make it an invasive species in many regions outside its native range."
