    "intro": "Myginda rhacoma, commonly known as the spiral fern, is a unique plant characterized by its intricate, spiral-shaped fronds. Its botanical structure consists of a rhizomatous stem that produces both roots and new growth. The leaves are typically narrow and arranged in a helical pattern around the stem, giving the plant its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant's reproductive structures include small, spore-bearing cones that are positioned along the fronds."
