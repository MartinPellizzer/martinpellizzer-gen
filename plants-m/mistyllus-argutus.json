    "intro": "Mistyllus argutus, commonly known as the hairy mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are often consumed by birds, which aid in seed dispersal. Its roots form haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to absorb nutrients. Mistyllus argutus is typically found in temperate regions and is often associated with oak and other broad-leaved trees."
