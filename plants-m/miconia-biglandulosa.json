    "intro": "Miconia biglandulosa, commonly known as the hairy miconia, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in dense, hairy glands, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Miconia biglandulosa is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions where it has been introduced."
