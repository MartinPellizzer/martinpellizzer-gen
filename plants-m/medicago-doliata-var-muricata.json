It features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a rough texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides. Medicago doliata var. muricata is also valued for its role in nitrogen fixation and as a forage plant for livestock."
