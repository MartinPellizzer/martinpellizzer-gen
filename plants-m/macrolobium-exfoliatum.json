    "intro": "Macrolobium exfoliatum, commonly known as the peeling-leaf tree, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves that often peel away in layers, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its bark is thick and rough, providing a natural defense against pests and environmental stress. The leaves are also used in traditional medicine for their potential anti-inflammatory properties."
