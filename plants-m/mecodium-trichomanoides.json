    "intro": "Mecodium trichomanoides, commonly known as the common mecodium, is a small, evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense, compact foliage with elliptical, dark green leaves that are slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in spring, followed by spherical, blue-black berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or containers. Mecodium trichomanoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract wildlife."
