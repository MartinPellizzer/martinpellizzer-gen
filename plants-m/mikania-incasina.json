    "intro": "Mikania incasina, commonly known as the Inca vine, is a climbing plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rapid growth and hairy, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain areas outside its native range."
