    "intro": "Myriopteris lindheimeri, commonly known as Lindheimer's holly fern, is a species of fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that remain throughout the year. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in woodland or scrub habitats. Its fronds are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, holly-like appearance, giving it its common name. It is a low-maintenance plant that thrives in partial shade and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
