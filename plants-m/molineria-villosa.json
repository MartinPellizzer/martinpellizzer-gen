    "intro": "Molineria villosa, commonly known as the hairy beak-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and other grass-like plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, three-lobed flowers. Its hairy leaves and stems give it a distinctive appearance, and it often grows in shallow water or damp soil. Molineria villosa plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and birds."
