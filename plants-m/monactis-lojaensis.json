    "intro": "Monactis lojaensis, commonly known as the Loja thornbush, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Capparaceae and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats at elevations between 1,200 and 2,500 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in fine hairs, while its fruits are capsule-like and contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
