    "intro": "Matelea boliviana, commonly known as the Bolivian moonflower, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Bolivia and Peru. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy, white flowers that open at night. The plant is a shrub or small tree, often growing in dry, rocky habitats. Its flowers emit a strong, sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators like moths. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a waxy surface, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments."
