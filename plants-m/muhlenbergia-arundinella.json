    "intro": "Muhlenbergia arundinella, commonly known as coastal muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, fluffy seed heads that are often mistaken for dandelion fluff. This plant thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is often found in dunes or along the edges of wetlands. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal environments and preventing erosion. Muhlenbergia arundinella is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh, coastal conditions."
