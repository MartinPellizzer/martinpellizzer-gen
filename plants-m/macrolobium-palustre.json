    "intro": "Macrolobium palustre, commonly known as the swamp hibiscus, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapting to its moist environment. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming from summer to fall. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in swampy areas. Macrolobium palustre is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds."
