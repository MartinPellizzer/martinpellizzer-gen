It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, which is known for its diverse and often drought-tolerant species. The plant features fleshy, narrow leaves that help it store water, adapting to arid environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in clusters and blooming during the warmer months. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
