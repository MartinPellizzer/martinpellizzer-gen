    "intro": "Melaleuca scabrida, commonly known as the rough-leaved paperbark, is a species of the myrtle family (Myrtaceae) native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, flaky bark that peels away in strips, revealing a pale, smooth underlayer. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, and features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a leathery texture. It produces small, pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months, followed by woody capsules that contain numerous seeds. Melaleuca scabrida is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, often found in heathlands and open forests."
