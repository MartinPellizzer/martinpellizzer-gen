    "intro": "Melaleuca lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels away in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in spikes, which are typically arranged in dense clusters. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough, textured surface. Melaleuca lancifolia is often found in coastal and wetland areas, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
