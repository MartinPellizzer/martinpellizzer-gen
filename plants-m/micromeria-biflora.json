    "intro": "Micromeria biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered micromeria, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, also known as the mustard family, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and aromatic foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Micromeria biflora is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in full sun conditions."
