    "intro": "Macrothelypteris oligophlebia var. elegans, commonly known as the elegant cliff brake, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, elongated shape. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered along the margins of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
