    "intro": "Maxillaria modesta, commonly known as the modest lady's slipper, is a terrestrial orchid native to Central and South America. It features a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs that support its evergreen foliage. The plant produces fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil. Maxillaria modesta thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in tropical forests."
