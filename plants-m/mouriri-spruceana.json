    "intro": "Mouriri spruceana, commonly known as the Brazilian spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, conical crown, with needle-like leaves arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree produces small, woody cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in humid, temperate climates and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss, Mouriri spruceana is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
