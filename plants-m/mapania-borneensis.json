The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are large, ovate, and have a smooth surface, while its flowers are usually pink or red, attracting various pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
