    "intro": "Mentha longifolia var. eisensteiniana, commonly known as the Russian germander, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its square stems, opposite leaves, and small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a strong, aromatic scent due to its high concentration of essential oils, particularly menthol and pulegone. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in rocky or dry environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
