    "intro": "Mimosa flagelliformis, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimic plant, is a climbing shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the cells. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bean-like pods containing seeds. Its stems are slender and twining, allowing it to climb and spread across various surfaces. Mimosa flagelliformis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique reactive foliage."
