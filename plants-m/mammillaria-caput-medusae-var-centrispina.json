    "intro": "Mammillaria caput-medusae var. centrispina, commonly known as the Medusa Cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a short, thick stem with a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that provide insulation and protection. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its spines are short and white, and it is highly prized for its ornamental value in succulent collections. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to ensure its survival."
