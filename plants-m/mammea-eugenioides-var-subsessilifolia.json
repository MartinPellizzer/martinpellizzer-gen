It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits containing hard, dark seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
