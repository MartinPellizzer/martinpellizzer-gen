    "intro": "Magnolia multinervia, commonly known as the broad-leaf magnolia, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves appear. The leaves are broad, ovate, and have a smooth texture with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The tree produces small, round fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a woody capsule. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and parks."
