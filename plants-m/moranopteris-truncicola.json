    "intro": "Moranopteris truncicola, commonly known as the truncated fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, truncate-shaped fronds that are often bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself in soil or substrate. Moranopteris truncicola is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
