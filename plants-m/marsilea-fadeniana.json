    "intro": "Marsilea fadeniana, commonly known as the water clover, is a small aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has four small, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, giving it a clover-like appearance. It produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are often submerged, followed by the development of small, round fruits. Marsilea fadeniana is often used in ornamental water gardens due to its delicate and attractive foliage."
