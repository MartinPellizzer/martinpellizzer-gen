    "intro": "Mentha arvensis var. uliginosa, commonly known as marsh mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom from June to August. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its aromatic properties, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent."
