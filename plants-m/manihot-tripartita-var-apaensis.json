    "intro": "Manihot tripartita var. apaensis, commonly known as the African arrowleaf, is a perennial shrub native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically arrow-shaped and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or secondary vegetation. The species is notable for its potential use in agroforestry and as a source of edible roots in some local communities."
