    "intro": "Melhania amboensis, commonly known as the Madagascar rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark hardwood which is highly valued for its strength and grain. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 15 meters. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a glossy green surface, while its flowers are small and white or pink, often clustered in inflorescences. Due to overharvesting, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native habitat."
