    "intro": "Miltonia velloziana, commonly known as the Velloziana orchid, is a tropical orchid native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that come in a range of colors, including pink, white, and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. The flowers bloom in clusters, often producing multiple blooms at once, making it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
