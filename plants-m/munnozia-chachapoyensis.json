    "intro": "Munnozia chachapoyensis, commonly known as the Chachapoyas mallow, is a flowering plant native to the Andean highlands of Peru. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 2,000 and 3,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
