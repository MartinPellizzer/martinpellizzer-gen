    "intro": "Microstylis pratensis, commonly known as the meadow microstylis, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the family Poaceae, or grass family. It is native to Europe and is typically found in moist grasslands and meadows. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often overlooked due to its modest appearance. Microstylis pratensis plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by providing food for invertebrates and contributing to soil stabilization."
