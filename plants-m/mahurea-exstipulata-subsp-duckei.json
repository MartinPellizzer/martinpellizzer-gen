    "intro": "Mahurea exstipulata subsp. duckei, commonly known as the Ducke's mahurea, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves that are often gland-dotted, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
