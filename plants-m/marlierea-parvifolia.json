    "intro": "Marlierea parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved marlierea, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings."
