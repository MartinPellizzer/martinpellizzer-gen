    "intro": "Mimusops penduliflora, commonly known as the hanging mimusops, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its pendulous, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often giving it a delicate, cascading appearance. The plant has elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its white blooms. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. The tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
