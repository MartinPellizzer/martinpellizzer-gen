It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and its ability to thrive in saline and waterlogged soils. The plant has opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are glossy and dark green. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible, dark purple drupes. The tree plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
