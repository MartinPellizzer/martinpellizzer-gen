    "intro": "Melaleuca eurystoma, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia, where it typically grows in coastal and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels away in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a silvery underside, and it produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers. Melaleuca eurystoma is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in coastal environments."
