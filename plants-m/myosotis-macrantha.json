    "intro": "Myosotis macrantha, commonly known as the giant forget-me-not, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which are typically larger than those of other forget-me-not species. The plant grows as a herbaceous perennial, often reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are hairy and somewhat woody at the base. Myosotis macrantha thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest margins and along stream banks."
