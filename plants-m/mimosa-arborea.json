    "intro": "Mimosa arborea, commonly known as the weeping mimosa, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-pink flowers in spring, which are followed by fluffy, white seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its unique foliage and adaptability contribute to its appeal in both natural and cultivated settings."
