    "intro": "Mentha longifolia f. zomborensis, commonly known as the Zomborensis mint, is a rare and lesser-known subspecies of the common mint plant. It is characterized by its aromatic, slightly peppery leaves and small, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. This subspecies is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andean foothills. Its botanical features include a creeping growth habit and a preference for moist, well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and unique traits, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
