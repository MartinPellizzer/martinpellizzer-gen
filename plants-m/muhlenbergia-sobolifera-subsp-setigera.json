    "intro": "Muhlenbergia sobolifera subsp. setigera, commonly known as the silver hairgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces fluffy, white to pale pink seed heads that are visually striking and attract pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular plant in native plant gardens."
