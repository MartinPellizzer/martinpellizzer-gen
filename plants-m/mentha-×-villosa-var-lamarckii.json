    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 villosa var. lamarckii, commonly known as woolly mint, is a hybrid perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fuzzy, gray-green foliage and aromatic, often menthol-like scent. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale purple, arranged in loose spikes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. This variety is often used in herbal teas and traditional medicine for its purported calming and digestive properties."
