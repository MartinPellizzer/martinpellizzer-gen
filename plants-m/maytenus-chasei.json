    "intro": "Maytenus chasei, commonly known as the Chihuahuan mayten, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to the Chihuahuan Desert in northern Mexico and southern Texas. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 6 meters and has a dense, rounded crown with thick, leathery leaves that are opposite or whorled. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by woody, spherical fruits containing a single seed. Maytenus chasei is adapted to arid conditions, with deep roots and a slow growth rate, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems."
