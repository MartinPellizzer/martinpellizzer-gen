    "intro": "Mesostemma alexeenkoanum, commonly known as the Alexander's mesostemma, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
