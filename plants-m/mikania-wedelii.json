    "intro": "Mikania wedelii, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a vigorous vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats, often invading disturbed areas. It produces small, green, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it is considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native range."
