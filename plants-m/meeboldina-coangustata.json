    "intro": "Meeboldina coangustata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved meebold, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in rocky crevices or along forest floors. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by small insects, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Meeboldina coangustata is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
