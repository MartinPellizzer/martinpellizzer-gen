    "intro": "Medicago rigidula var. morisiana, commonly known as the Morisian goatweed, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, which are followed by small, legume-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
