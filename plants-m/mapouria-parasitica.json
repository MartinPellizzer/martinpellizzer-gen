    "intro": "Mapouria parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic mapouria, is a hemiparasitic plant that derives some of its nutrients from host plants. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is native to tropical regions of Africa. The plant has small, opposite leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers. It lacks chlorophyll in its stems and roots, relying on its host for water and minerals. Its parasitic nature makes it an interesting subject for studying plant interactions and ecological dependencies."
