    "intro": "Meliosma herbertii var. tepuiensis, commonly known as the tepui meliosma, is a rare shrub native to the tepuis of South America. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes many shrubs and small trees adapted to nutrient-poor soils. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a distinctive glandular pubescence. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, and it is often found in rocky, high-altitude habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
