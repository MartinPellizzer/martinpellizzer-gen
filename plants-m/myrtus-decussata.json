    "intro": "Myrtus decussata, commonly known as the dwarf myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, dark green, leathery leaves that are often arranged in decussate pairs, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces tiny, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. Myrtus decussata is also valued for its aromatic foliage and historical use in traditional medicine."
