It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and distinctive hairy stems, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers and is often used as a cover crop due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. It thrives in temperate climates and is adaptable to various soil types. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological restoration and sustainable agriculture."
