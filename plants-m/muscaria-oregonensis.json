    "intro": "Muscaria oregonensis, commonly known as the Oregon fly agaric, is a species of psychedelic mushroom native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its white, bulbous cap and a pale yellow to orange stem, often with a ring around the middle. The fruiting bodies typically appear in late summer and early autumn, growing in coniferous or mixed forests. The cap is initially closed and expands as the mushroom matures, while the gills are attached to the stem. This species contains psychoactive compounds such as ibotenic acid and muscimol, which contribute to its hallucinogenic effects."
