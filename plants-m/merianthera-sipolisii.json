    "intro": "Merianthera sipolisii, commonly known as the Sipolisi sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Merianthera sipolisii is considered a rare and endangered species, with limited distribution and specific habitat requirements."
