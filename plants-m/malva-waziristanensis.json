    "intro": "Malva waziristanensis, commonly known as the Waziristan mallow, is a flowering plant species native to the mountainous regions of Pakistan and Afghanistan. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
