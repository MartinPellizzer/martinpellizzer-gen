    "intro": "Mariscus rohlfsii, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes plants such as hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its woody stems, lance-shaped leaves, and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. Mariscus rohlfsii is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
