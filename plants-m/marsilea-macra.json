    "intro": "Marsilea macra, commonly known as water clover, is a aquatic fern that thrives in freshwater environments. It is characterized by its small, clover-like leaves that float on the water surface or lie submerged. The plant has a delicate, branched rhizome system that helps it anchor in mud or soft sediment. Its reproductive structures include sporocarps that release spores into the water. Marsilea macra is often found in ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams, contributing to aquatic ecosystems."
