    "intro": "Machilus macranthus, commonly known as the large-fruited chinquapin, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Lauraceae family, which includes laurels, avocados, and cinnamon. The plant is characterized by its elliptical, glossy leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in the spring. Its fruit is a woody, capsule-like structure that splits open to release small, dark seeds. Machilus macranthus is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and stream sides."
