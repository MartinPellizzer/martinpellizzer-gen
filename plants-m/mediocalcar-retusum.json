    "intro": "Mediocalcar retusum, commonly known as the smooth-winged orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, lance-shaped leaves and intricate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, feature a distinctive retuse (notched) lip, contributing to its scientific name. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Mediocalcar retusum is considered endangered and is protected in many countries."
