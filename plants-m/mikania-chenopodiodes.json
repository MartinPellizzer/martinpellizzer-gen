    "intro": "Mikania chenopodiodes, commonly known as Mexican morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it can become a problematic weed in some regions."
