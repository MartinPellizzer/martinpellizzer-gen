    "intro": "Mastixia premnoides, commonly known as the silky gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, light grey bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is commonly found in rainforest and dry sclerophyll forest communities. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional Aboriginal practices."
