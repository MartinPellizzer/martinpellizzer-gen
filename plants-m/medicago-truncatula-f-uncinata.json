    "intro": "Medicago truncatula f. uncinata, commonly known as the hooked medic, is a variant of the common medick, characterized by its distinctive hooked hairs on the stems and leaves. This plant is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. It typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, roadsides, and agricultural fields. The leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet having a slightly hairy surface, and the flowers are small, pink to purple, and clustered in racemes. It is a perennial herb that plays a role in soil stabilization and serves as a forage plant for livestock."
