    "intro": "Martinezia abrupta, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and pairs of opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming primarily in spring and early summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Martinezia abrupta plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
