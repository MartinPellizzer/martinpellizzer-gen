    "intro": "Mephitidia formosensis var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy mephitid, is a rare variant of the mephitid plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that provides insulation and protection against environmental stressors. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a waxy coating, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by wind or insects. The botanical significance of this variant lies in its unique adaptations and potential role in local ecosystems."
