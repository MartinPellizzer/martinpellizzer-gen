It features a sympodial growth habit with a short, horizontal rhizome and erect, hairy pseudobulbs. The plant produces racemes of fragrant, violet-colored flowers with a distinctive, narrow column. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in two rows along the stem. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, organic soil for optimal growth."
