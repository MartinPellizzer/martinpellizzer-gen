    "intro": "Malaxis mucronata, commonly known as the small-flowered orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its leaves are strap-shaped and often clustered at the base, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil. Malaxis mucronata is part of the Orchidaceae family and is valued for its unique floral structure and ecological significance."
