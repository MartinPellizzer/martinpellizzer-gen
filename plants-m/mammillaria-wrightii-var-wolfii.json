    "intro": "Mammillaria wrightii var. wolfii, commonly known as the Wright's mammillaria, is a compact cactus native to Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in white, woolly spines and prominent, rounded tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. It is well-suited for rock gardens and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
