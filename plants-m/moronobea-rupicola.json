It belongs to the family Moraceae, which includes figs and mulberries, and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, inedible fruits that are typically green when mature, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It is often found growing on rocky outcrops and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists."
