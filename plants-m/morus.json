    "intro": "Morus, commonly known as the mulberry tree, is a genus of deciduous trees and shrubs belonging to the Moraceae family. It is characterized by its alternate, simple leaves that are often lobed or serrated, and its distinctive, aggregate fruits known as syconia. The tree produces a variety of edible fruits, with white, pink, and black varieties being the most common. Morus species are widely cultivated for their fruit, which is used in food, beverages, and traditional medicine. Additionally, the tree is valued for its rapid growth and role in silk production, as its leaves are the primary food source for silkworms."
