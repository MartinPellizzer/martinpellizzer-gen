    "intro": "Mentha aquatica var. intricata, commonly known as water mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and moist environments. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy and have a strong minty aroma. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in whorled clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. This variant is distinguished by its intricate leaf patterns and is often used in herbal remedies and as a culinary herb."
