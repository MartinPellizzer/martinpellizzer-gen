    "intro": "Mangifera orophila, commonly known as the mountain mango, is a species of flowering plant in the Anacardiaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like India and Nepal. The plant is characterized by its large, elongated leaves and produces small, yellowish-green fruits that are typically not consumed by humans. Its botanical features include a woody structure and a preference for well-drained, acidic soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within the genus Mangifera."
