    "intro": "Malmea, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rhamnaceae. It is native to southern Africa and includes several species that are often shrubs or small trees. The plants are characterized by their silver-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine hairs. Malmea species typically have small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. They are adapted to arid environments and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
