    "intro": "Malacothrix runcinata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed dandelion, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features basal leaves that are lanceolate and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
