It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the morning, hence its common name. It has a rapid growth rate and is often considered an invasive species in certain regions. The stems are covered in fine hairs, and the leaves are typically angular, giving the plant its scientific name."
