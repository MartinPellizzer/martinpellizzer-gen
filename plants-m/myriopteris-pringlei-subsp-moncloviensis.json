    "intro": "Myriopteris pringlei subsp. moncloviensis, commonly known as the Monclova cliffbrake, is a fern native to the mountainous regions of northeastern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a serrated margin. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in cliffs and limestone outcrops. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This subspecies is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations."
