    "intro": "Minuartia tenuifolia var. confertiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered rockcress, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to rocky and arid environments. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or coastal regions. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for xerophytic habitats and it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
