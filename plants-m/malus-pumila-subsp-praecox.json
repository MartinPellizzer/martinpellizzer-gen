    "intro": "Malus pumila subsp. praecox, commonly known as the early apple, is a subspecies of the apple tree native to central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its small, sour fruits that ripen earlier than those of the common apple. The plant typically grows as a deciduous tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces white flowers in the spring. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical significance in apple cultivation."
