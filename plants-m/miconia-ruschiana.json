It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of showy, pinkish-white flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
