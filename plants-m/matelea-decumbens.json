    "intro": "Matelea decumbens, commonly known as the Mexican morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. The plant features heart-shaped leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its vines can climb or trail along the ground, and it is known for its rapid growth habit. The flowers open in the early morning and close by midday, hence its common name."
