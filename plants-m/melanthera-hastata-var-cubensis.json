It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered purple to pink flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed habitats. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically valuable species in its native range."
