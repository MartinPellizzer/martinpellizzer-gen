    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 verticillata f. elaia, commonly known as the lemon-scented water mint, is a hybrid perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves that emit a distinct lemony fragrance when crushed. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers arranged in whorled clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as ponds and streams. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for both ornamental and ecological purposes."
