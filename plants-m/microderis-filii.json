    "intro": "Microderis filii, commonly known as the filial microdermis, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clusters of pale yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant has a unique root system that allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor soil, and its stems are covered in a fine, hair-like structure that aids in water retention. Microderis filii is also notable for its ability to attract specific pollinators, such as certain species of bees and moths. Due to habitat loss, it is currently listed as endangered by the IUCN."
