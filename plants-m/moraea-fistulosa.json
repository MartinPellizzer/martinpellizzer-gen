    "intro": "Moraea fistulosa, commonly known as the red-hot poker, is a striking perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescences that bear bright orange to red tubular flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves that are usually evergreen, providing a contrast to the showy flower spikes. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Moraea fistulosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
