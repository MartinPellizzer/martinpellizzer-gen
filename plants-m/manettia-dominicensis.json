    "intro": "Manettia dominicensis, commonly known as the Hispaniola beautyberry, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by bright red berries that are a striking feature of the species. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along stream banks. The berries are edible for some animals but are generally not consumed by humans due to their bitter taste."
