    "intro": "Mauchia hirtella, commonly known as the hairy mauchia, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in open woodlands. The plant features a basal rosette of hairy, ovate leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. Its small, yellowish-green flowers bloom in late spring, forming clusters at the ends of leafy stems. Mauchia hirtella is characterized by its distinctive hairy texture and adaptability to wetland environments."
