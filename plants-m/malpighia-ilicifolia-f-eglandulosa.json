    "intro": "Malpighia ilicifolia f. eglandulosa, commonly known as the glandular huito, is a variant of the huito plant native to Central and South America. It is a shrub characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces bright red, fleshy berries that are edible and often used in local cuisines. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with five petals and yellow stamens. The glandular features on its leaves and stems distinguish this form from the typical species, contributing to its unique botanical profile."
