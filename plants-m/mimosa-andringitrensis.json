    "intro": "Mimosa andringitrensis, commonly known as the Andringa mimosa, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by fluffy, pale brown pods. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in moist forests or along stream banks. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
