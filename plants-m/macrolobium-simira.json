    "intro": "Macrolobium simira, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Central and West Africa. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Its bark is thick and deeply fissured, often exuding a fragrant resin. The plant is valued for its durable, heavy wood, which has been traditionally used in construction and furniture-making."
