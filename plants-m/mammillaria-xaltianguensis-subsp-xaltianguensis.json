It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in white to pale green spines and is characterized by its dense, woolly coating. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are often borne on short pedicels. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. This subspecies is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in succulent gardens."
