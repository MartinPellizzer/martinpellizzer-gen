    "intro": "Mazus miquelii f. contractus, commonly known as the compact mazus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It features small, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal, it is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
