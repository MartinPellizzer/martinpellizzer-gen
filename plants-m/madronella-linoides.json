    "intro": "Madronella linoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf madrona, is a small evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically evergreen and arranged in whorls along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, which are followed by berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to dry, sunny environments."
