    "intro": "Melica brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved brome, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that can reach heights of up to 60 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often shorter than the stems. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is usually erect and contains small, two-rowed spikelets. Melica brevifolia is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
