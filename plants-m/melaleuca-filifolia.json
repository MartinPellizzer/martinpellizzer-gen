    "intro": "Melaleuca filifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to eastern Australia, where it typically grows in coastal and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and its distinctive, smooth, peeling bark that reveals a white or pale inner layer. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Melaleuca filifolia is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in coastal environments."
