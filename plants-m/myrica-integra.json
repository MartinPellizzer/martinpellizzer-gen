It is characterized by its smooth, aromatic bark and small, dark green, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by dark blue, waxy berries. Myrica integra thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
