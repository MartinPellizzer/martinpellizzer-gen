    "intro": "Mucuna diabolica subsp. kenneallyi, commonly known as the devil's bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, twisted tendrils that aid in its vine-like growth. The plant produces showy, purple-pink flowers followed by elongated pods containing dark, bean-like seeds. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, known for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
