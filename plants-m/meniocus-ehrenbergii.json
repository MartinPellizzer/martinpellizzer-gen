    "intro": "Meniocus ehrenbergii, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its trumpet-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant has a sprawling growth habit with woody stems and hairy leaves adapted to withstand hot, dry conditions. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by hummingbirds, which are attracted to its nectar. Meniocus ehrenbergii is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
