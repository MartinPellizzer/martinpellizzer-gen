    "intro": "Melanodendron integrifolium, commonly known as the smoothleaf melanodendron, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and its lance-shaped, smooth-edged leaves that give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
