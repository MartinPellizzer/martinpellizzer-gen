It is characterized by its woody stems and dense clusters of small, pink or white flowers. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs. It is well adapted to dry, rocky environments and is often found on coastal cliffs. Monotoca empetrifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
