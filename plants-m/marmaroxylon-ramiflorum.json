    "intro": "Marmaroxylon ramiflorum, commonly known as the desert sand-wood, is a small, evergreen shrub native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its hardy nature allows it to thrive in poor soils and withstand extreme temperatures. Due to its unique adaptations, it plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local biodiversity."
