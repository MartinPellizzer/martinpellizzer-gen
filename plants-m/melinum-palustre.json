It typically features small, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has thin, wiry stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along riverbanks. Melinum palustre is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
