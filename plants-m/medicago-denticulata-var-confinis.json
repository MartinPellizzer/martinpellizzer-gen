    "intro": "Medicago denticulata var. confinis, commonly known as the coastal medick, is a perennial legume native to the coastal regions of western North America. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. It plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and improving soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. Its adaptability to coastal conditions makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
