    "intro": "Mammillaria densa, commonly known as the dense mammilla, is a species of cactus native to the dry regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense covering of small, white spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which bloom from areoles located near the base of the stems. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it is adapted to survive in arid environments with minimal water. Mammillaria densa is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
