    "intro": "Mimosa hirsutissima, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its unique sensitivity to touch and environmental stimuli has made it a subject of scientific interest and a symbol of responsiveness in various cultures."
