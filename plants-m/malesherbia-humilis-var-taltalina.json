    "intro": "Malesherbia humilis var. taltalina, commonly known as the Taltal malesherbia, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Chile. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid and coastal conditions of its habitat. It is often found in coastal scrub and maritime environments, where it contributes to local biodiversity. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
