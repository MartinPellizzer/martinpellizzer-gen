It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rapid growth and trailing habit. The plant features opposite, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It is often found in humid, tropical environments, particularly in forest understories. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
