    "intro": "Myrothamnus flabellifolius subsp. robustus, commonly known as the African umbrella tree, is a unique succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-like rosette of fleshy, waxy leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by woody, branching fruit clusters. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. Due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular ornamental plant in dry gardens."
