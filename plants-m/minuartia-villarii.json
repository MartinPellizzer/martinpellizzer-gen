    "intro": "Minuartia villarii, commonly known as the rock\u767d\u83dc or rock mustard, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to rocky and coastal areas of southern Europe and North Africa, it thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils. The plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as gravelly slopes and cliff faces. Its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions makes it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
