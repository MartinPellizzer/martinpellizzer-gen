    "intro": "Manulea glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky manulea, is a unique plant species native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often displaying a range of colors from white to pink. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Manulea glandulosa is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
