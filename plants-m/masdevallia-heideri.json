    "intro": "Masdevallia heideri, commonly known as the Heider's masdevallia, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its intricate, often colorful flower structure with elongated petals and a distinctive, spurred lip. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its botanical features include a sympodial growth pattern and a preference for high humidity and indirect light. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is highly valued in botanical collections and conservation efforts."
