    "intro": "Microsorum normale, commonly known as the Java fern, is a popular aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread along the substrate in aquariums. The plant features lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. It is well adapted to low-light conditions and can thrive in a variety of water parameters. Microsorum normale is valued for its aesthetic appeal and ease of care in both freshwater and brackish environments."
