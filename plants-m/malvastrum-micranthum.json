    "intro": "Malvastrum micranthum, commonly known as the small-flowered mallow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often hairy and somewhat succulent. Malvastrum micranthum is often found in open woodlands, grasslands, and along streambanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
