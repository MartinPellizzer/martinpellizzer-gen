    "intro": "Malus rivularis, commonly known as the river crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It typically grows near water sources, such as streams and rivers, which is reflected in its common name. The plant produces small, ornamental flowers in spring, followed by edible, crabapple-like fruits. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a serrated margin. Malus rivularis is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its adaptability to moist, well-drained soils."
