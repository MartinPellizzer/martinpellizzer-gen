    "intro": "Mentha microphylla var. condensata, commonly known as condensed mint, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that are densely packed along the stems. The plant produces tiny, pale blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in whorls along the stems. Its aromatic leaves emit a strong mint scent, making it a popular choice for culinary and medicinal uses. This variety is well adapted to cool, moist environments and thrives in partial shade."
