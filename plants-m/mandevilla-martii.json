    "intro": "Mandevilla martii, commonly known as the pink mandevilla, is a climbing perennial plant native to South America. It features vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red, often with a white throat. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are dark green and provide a striking contrast to its colorful blooms. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Mandevilla martii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its showy flowers and vigorous growth habit."
