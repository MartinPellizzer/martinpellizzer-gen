    "intro": "Malvastrum cockerellii, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant is well adapted to survive in harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
