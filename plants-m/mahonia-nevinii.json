    "intro": "Mahonia nevinii, commonly known as the Nevin's Mahonia, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with leathery, dark green leaves that have a distinctive yellow underside. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by blue-black berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its upright growth habit and seasonal color changes."
