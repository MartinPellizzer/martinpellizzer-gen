    "intro": "Mimosa tandilensis, commonly known as the Tandil mimosa, is a shrub native to Argentina. It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by the plant's sensitivity to touch. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. Mimosa tandilensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
