It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by three-winged, capsule-like fruits. Its leaves contain alkaloids, including mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, which contribute to its traditional use. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and partial shade."
