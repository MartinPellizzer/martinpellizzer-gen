    "intro": "Melocactus concinnus subsp. axiniphorus, commonly known as the Mexican torch cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the apex of the stem. It is adapted to thrive in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is highly valued in horticulture."
