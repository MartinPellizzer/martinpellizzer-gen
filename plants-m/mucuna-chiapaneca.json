    "intro": "Mucuna chiapaneca, commonly known as the Mexican velvet bean, is a climbing legume native to Central America. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and trifoliate leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing dark brown seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is adapted to grow in a variety of soil types. Mucuna chiapaneca is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
