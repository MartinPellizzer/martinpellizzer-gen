It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a soft, velvety texture, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments.

Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
