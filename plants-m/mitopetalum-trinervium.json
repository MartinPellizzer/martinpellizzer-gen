    "intro": "Mitopetalum trinervium, commonly known as the three-veined mitopetalum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves with three main veins, and its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
