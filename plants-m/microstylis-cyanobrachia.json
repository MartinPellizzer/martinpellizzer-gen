    "intro": "Microstylis cyanobrachia, commonly known as the blue-stemmed microstylis, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems that often display a striking blue or purple hue due to the presence of anthocyanins. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale blue, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, and are often covered with fine, silky hairs. Microstylis cyanobrachia thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshy or swampy habitats."
