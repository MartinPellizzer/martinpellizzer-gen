    "intro": "Mitrophyllum niveum, commonly known as the snow-moss, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth form and pale green to white foliage, which helps it reflect intense sunlight. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often hidden among its foliage, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in rocky crevices or on slopes. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Mitrophyllum niveum is considered a vulnerable species."
