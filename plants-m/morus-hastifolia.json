    "intro": "Morus hastifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mulberry, is a deciduous tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its simple, lance-shaped leaves that are often serrated along the edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as mulberries, which are typically green when unripe and turn dark purple or black when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm climate with adequate rainfall. Morus hastifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
