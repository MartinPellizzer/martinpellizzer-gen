    "intro": "Mimosa somnians var. viscida, commonly known as the sticky mimosa, is a variant of the sticky mimosa plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and its ability to produce a sticky, resinous substance on its stems and leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are sensitive to touch, curling when disturbed, which is a common trait among mimosa species. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for its unique appearance and ecological adaptations."
