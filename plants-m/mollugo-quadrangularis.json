    "intro": "Mollugo quadrangularis, commonly known as the four-angle mossy grass, is a low-growing annual plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that are typically quadrangular in cross-section, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and is often found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. It has fibrous roots and is adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-poor environments. Mollugo quadrangularis is also known for its ability to tolerate shade and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
