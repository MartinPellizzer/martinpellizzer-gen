    "intro": "Macroclinium borjaense, commonly known as the Borja's macroclinium, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that often feature vibrant colors. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as cloud forests, where it thrives in the cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
