    "intro": "Macrothelypteris rammelooi, commonly known as the Rammeloo's hakea, is a fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in clusters on the underside of the fronds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
