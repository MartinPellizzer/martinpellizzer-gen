These plants are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are characterized by their showy, often fragrant flowers and edible fruits. The leaves are typically alternate, simple, and ovate, while the bark is usually smooth and grayish in younger trees. Malus species are widely cultivated for their ornamental value and for the production of apples, which are rich in nutrients and used in various culinary and medicinal applications. The genus also includes some species that are valued for their ornamental flowers and autumn foliage."
