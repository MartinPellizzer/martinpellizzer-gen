    "intro": "Medicago falcata var. alpigena, commonly known as the alpine sickle vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, sickle-shaped leaves and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. This plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and open slopes. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment in degraded habitats. The varietal form alpigena is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and smaller leaves compared to the typical variety."
