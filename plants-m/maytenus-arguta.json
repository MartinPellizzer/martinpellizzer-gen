    "intro": "Maytenus arguta, commonly known as the rough mayten, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to South America. It belongs to the family Rutaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often rough to the touch. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by small, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in humid lowland forests. Maytenus arguta is valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental appeal."
