    "intro": "Microculcas marattioides, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a striking member of the Cyatheaceae family. It is characterized by its massive, tree-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant features a sturdy, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy layer called the rachis. Its fronds are bi-pinnate, with a distinctive zigzag pattern along the midrib. Native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
