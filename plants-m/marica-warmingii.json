    "intro": "Marica warmingii, commonly known as the Warming's marica, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in cloud forests or along riverbanks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Marica warmingii is considered a vulnerable species."
