    "intro": "Miconia ascenditricha, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that are typically borne on branched inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous tiny seeds. Miconia ascenditricha is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets."
