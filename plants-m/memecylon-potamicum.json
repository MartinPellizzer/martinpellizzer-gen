It is native to the wetlands and riverine forests of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like India and Indonesia. The plant features opposite, elliptical leaves with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside. Its small, fragrant flowers are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters at the ends of branches. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal in aquatic environments."
