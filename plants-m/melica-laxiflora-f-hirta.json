    "intro": "Melica laxiflora f. hirta, commonly known as the hairy looseflower grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is a perennial species characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged, giving the plant its common name. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. This variety is distinguished by its hairy texture, which is more pronounced than in the typical form of Melica laxiflora."
