    "intro": "Morus mongolica var. pubescens, commonly known as the Mongolian mulberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its pubescent (hairy) leaves and small, aggregate fruits that ripen in late summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and livestock. Its hardy nature makes it adaptable to harsh climatic conditions."
