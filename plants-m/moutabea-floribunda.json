    "intro": "Moutabea floribunda, commonly known as the Madagascar ebony, is a tropical tree native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood and is often found in lowland rainforests. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth texture. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody fruits containing a single seed. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
