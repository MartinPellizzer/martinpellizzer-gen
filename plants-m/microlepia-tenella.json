    "intro": "Microlepia tenella, commonly known as the slender chain fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant produces small, round spore cases called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Microlepia tenella is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
