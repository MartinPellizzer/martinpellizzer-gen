    "intro": "Meadia pendula, commonly known as the weeping meadia, is a herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, pendulous stems that bear small, lance-shaped leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Meadia pendula thrives in moist, shady environments, often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its delicate appearance and unique growth habit make it a striking addition to botanical gardens and wetland restoration projects."
