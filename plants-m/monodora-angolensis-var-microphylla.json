    "intro": "Monodora angolensis var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved African tamarind, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically small and opposite, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody pods containing flat, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. The plant has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties and as a source of timber."
