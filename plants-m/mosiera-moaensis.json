    "intro": "Mosiera moaensis, commonly known as the Maori daisy, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in coastal and lowland areas, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers range in color from white to pale yellow. Mosiera moaensis is culturally significant to the M\u0101ori people and is often found in conservation areas due to its limited distribution."
