    "intro": "Menisciopsis penangiana, commonly known as the Penang menisciopsis, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Peninsular Malaysia. It belongs to the family Menispermaceae, characterized by its climbing habit and the presence of calcium oxalate crystals in its tissues. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in racemose inflorescences. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a distinctive palmate venation pattern. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
