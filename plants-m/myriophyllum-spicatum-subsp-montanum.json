The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem, and it produces small, white to light blue flowers in late summer. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in a variety of water conditions, making it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive. Its botanical structure supports a diverse array of aquatic life, contributing to the ecosystem's biodiversity."
