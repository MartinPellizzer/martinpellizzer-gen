    "intro": "Magnolia grandiflora, commonly known as the Southern magnolia, is a large evergreen tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, glossy, dark green leaves and its showy, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The flowers are large, with multiple layers of petal-like bracts, and they often remain on the tree for several weeks. The tree can grow up to 40 meters tall and has a slow growth rate, making it a long-lived species. Its ornamental value is highly appreciated in gardens and landscapes for its year-round aesthetic appeal."
