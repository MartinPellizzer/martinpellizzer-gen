    "intro": "Medicago falcata subsp. tyrnensis, commonly known as the Crimean goat's rue, is a perennial legume native to the Caucasus and southern Russia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as steppes and rocky areas. It has a deep root system, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread across arid regions."
