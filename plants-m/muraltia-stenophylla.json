    "intro": "Muraltia stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf muraltia, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, also known as the legume or pea family, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or dry woodlands. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in warm climates."
