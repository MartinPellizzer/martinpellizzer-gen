    "intro": "Martellidendron karaka, commonly known as the karaka tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Proteaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing toxic seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in coastal and inland regions of New Zealand. The karaka tree plays an important ecological role, providing habitat and food for native wildlife."
