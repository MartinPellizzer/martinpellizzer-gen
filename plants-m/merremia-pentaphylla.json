    "intro": "Merremia pentaphylla, commonly known as the five-leaf morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along forest edges. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it both a popular garden plant and a potential invasive species in some areas."
