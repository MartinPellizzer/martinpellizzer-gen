    "intro": "Melanthesa rubra, commonly known as red sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are succulent and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, helping to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Melanthesa rubra is adapted to cold climates and is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils."
