    "intro": "Miconia chamissois, commonly known as the giant miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a fleshy, orange-red berry that contains numerous seeds. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
