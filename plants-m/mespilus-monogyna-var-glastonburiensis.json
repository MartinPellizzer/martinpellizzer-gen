    "intro": "Mespilus monogyna var. glastonburiensis, commonly known as the Glastonbury Thorn, is a rare and ancient variety of the common medlar. It is characterized by its thorny stems, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces edible fruits that ripen in the autumn, though they are typically not consumed due to their astringent taste. This variety is notable for its historical significance and is often found in old gardens and woodland edges."
