    "intro": "Medicago hispida var. pentacycla, commonly known as the purple medic or redstem medic, is a perennial forage legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that are followed by cylindrical, spiny pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in pasture and erosion control due to its hardiness. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable in sustainable agricultural systems."
