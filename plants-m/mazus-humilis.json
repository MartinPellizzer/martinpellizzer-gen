    "intro": "Mazus humilis, commonly known as the creeping mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features small, hairy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically less than an inch in diameter. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and dense foliage make it an effective ground cover in natural landscapes."
