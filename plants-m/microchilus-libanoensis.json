    "intro": "Microchilus libanoensis, commonly known as the Lebanon microchilus, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the mountainous regions of Lebanon. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and limestone soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are narrow and finely divided, while its flowers are small and white or pale pink in color. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
