    "intro": "Manilkara littoralis, commonly known as the coastal manilkara, is a tropical evergreen tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in humid, saline environments. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers followed by edible, spiny fruits that contain a sweet, starchy pulp. Its bark is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. Manilkara littoralis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
