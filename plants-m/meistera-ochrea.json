    "intro": "Meistera ochrea, commonly known as the golden bell vine, is a tropical plant native to Central America. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Meistera ochrea thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a climbing plant."
