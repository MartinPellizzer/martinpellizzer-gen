It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
