    "intro": "Masdevallia leptoura, commonly known as the slender-lobed masdevallia, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, strap-like leaves and intricate, often colorful floral structures. The plant typically grows as a small epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark in its natural habitat. Its flowers are usually pale to dark purple, with a distinctive lip that adds to its ornamental appeal. Due to its specific environmental requirements, it is a challenging plant to cultivate outside its native range."
