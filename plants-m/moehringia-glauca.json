    "intro": "Moehringia glauca, commonly known as the blue moehringia, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial herb native to the northern regions of North America. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, blue-gray pubescence, giving the plant its characteristic color. The flowers are small, white to pale blue, and are clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
