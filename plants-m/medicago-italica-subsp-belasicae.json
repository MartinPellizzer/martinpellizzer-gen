    "intro": "Medicago italica subsp. belasicae, commonly known as the Balkan medick, is a perennial legume native to southeastern Europe. It features trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Its subspecific classification highlights its distinct ecological and morphological characteristics compared to other Medicago species."
