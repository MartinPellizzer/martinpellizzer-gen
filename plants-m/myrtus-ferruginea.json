    "intro": "Myrtus ferruginea, commonly known as red myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves that are often covered with a rusty, reddish bloom, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red or black berries. Myrtus ferruginea is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its aromatic properties."
