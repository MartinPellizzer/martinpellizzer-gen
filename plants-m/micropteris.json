    "intro": "Micropteris, commonly known as the water fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Pellaeaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that often have a distinctive, feathery appearance. Micropteris species are typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant's spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. These ferns play an important role in ecological systems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
