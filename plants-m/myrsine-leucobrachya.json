It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves with prominent white veins, which give it its common name. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, fleshy berries. Myrsine leucobrachya is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and rocky areas."
