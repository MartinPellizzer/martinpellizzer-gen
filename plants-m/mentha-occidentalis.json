    "intro": "Mentha occidentalis, commonly known as American mint, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often aromatic when crushed. The plant produces small, pale purple flowers in whorled clusters, which are typical of the Lamiaceae family. Its essential oils, rich in menthol and other terpenes, contribute to its distinctive cooling and minty fragrance. Mentha occidentalis is often cultivated for culinary and medicinal purposes due to its versatile uses."
