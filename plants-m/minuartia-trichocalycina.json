    "intro": "Minuartia trichocalycina, commonly known as the mossy rockcress, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white to grayish hairs. The flowers are typically small, yellow or greenish-yellow, and arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. This plant is adapted to harsh conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
