    "intro": "Melampodium heterophyllum, commonly known as the heterophyllous tickseed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow-orange flowers and its unique leaf morphology, which varies depending on environmental conditions. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its flowering period occurs from summer to early fall, and it is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open fields. Melampodium heterophyllum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
