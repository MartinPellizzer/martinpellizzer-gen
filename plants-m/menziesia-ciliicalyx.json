    "intro": "Menziesia ciliicalyx, commonly known as the hairyleaf menziesia, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are densely covered with fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in late spring, followed by small, dark blue berries in the fall. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded woodlands. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal interest."
