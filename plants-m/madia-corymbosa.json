    "intro": "Madia corymbosa, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations to drought conditions. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. Its showy, white to pink flowers bloom in summer, forming a loose corymb, which attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies. Madia corymbosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
