    "intro": "Madronella exilis, commonly known as the slender madrona, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to the western United States, particularly found in coastal regions of California and Oregon. The plant is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of white or pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. Due to its limited range and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
