    "intro": "Metrosideros polymorpha f. obovata, commonly known as the Tahitian flame tree, is a variant of the native Hawaiian species with distinctive botanical features. It is characterized by its obovate, glossy, dark green leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant red flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like or small tree-like, with a dense, rounded form. This form is adapted to the tropical and subtropical climates of its native habitat, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight."
