    "intro": "Microlepia angustipinna, commonly known as the narrow-panicle microlepia, is a fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that arise from a short, creeping rhizome. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves, typical of the Dryopteridaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for cultivation in shaded garden settings."
