    "intro": "Melaleuca fraseri, commonly known as the broad-leaved paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a slight aromatic scent. Melaleuca fraseri is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
