    "intro": "Momordica subangulata subsp. renigera, commonly known as the horned cucumber, is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, horn-shaped fruits that are typically green when immature and turn orange-red when mature. The plant is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces yellow flowers that are often followed by the unique fruit. This species is cultivated for its edible fruits, which have a bitter taste due to the presence of cucurbitacins."
