It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves and small, white to greenish-yellow flowers that appear in umbels. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It is native to parts of North America, particularly the southwestern United States. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
