    "intro": "Manihot michaelis, commonly known as Michael's arrowroot, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary edible part. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves and yellowish-green flowers. Its tubers are starchy and can be used as a thickening agent in cooking, similar to arrowroot. The plant is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils, making it an important crop in certain agricultural systems."
