    "intro": "Malapoenna latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf malapoenna, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, which bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural gardens."
