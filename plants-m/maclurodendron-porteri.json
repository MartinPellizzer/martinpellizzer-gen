    "intro": "Maclurodendron porteri, commonly known as the Sierra Madre magnolia, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in early spring, often with a subtle pinkish tinge. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
