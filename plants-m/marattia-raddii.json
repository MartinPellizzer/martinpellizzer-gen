    "intro": "Marattia raddii, commonly known as the Raddi's marattia, is a rare and ancient fern species belonging to the family Marattiaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length, often with a distinctive bipinnate structure. The plant is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests. Its spores are produced in specialized structures called sorangia, which are clustered on the undersides of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Marattia raddii is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
