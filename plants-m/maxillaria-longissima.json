    "intro": "Maxillaria longissima, commonly known as the long-stemmed maxillaria, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that produce multiple leaves and flowering stems. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. Its flowers are typically borne on long, branched inflorescences, making it a striking ornamental plant. Maxillaria longissima prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for greenhouse cultivation."
