    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 dumetorum var. limnogeton, commonly known as water mint, is a perennial herb native to moist habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorled clusters, typical of the Lamiaceae family. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils that contribute to its minty scent and medicinal properties. It thrives in wet soils near streams, ponds, and marshes, making it a common sight in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments."
