It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant typically features a single, erect stem that bears several flowers, each with a prominent, velvety lip. Its leaves are broad and ovate, often with a waxy texture, and it prefers bright, indirect light and moderate humidity. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in a home setting."
