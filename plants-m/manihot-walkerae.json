It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its smooth, waxy leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers. It is often found growing in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. The plant is related to the manioc (Manihot esculenta), but it is not typically cultivated for its edible roots."
