    "intro": "Mariscus alpestris, commonly known as the alpine mariscus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes familiar plants like carrots and parsley. The plant is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its high-altitude environment. Mariscus alpestris is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds."
