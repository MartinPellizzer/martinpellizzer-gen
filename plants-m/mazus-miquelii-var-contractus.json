    "intro": "Mazus miquelii var. contractus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mazus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are densely packed along its stems, giving it a mat-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of pale blue to lavender flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
