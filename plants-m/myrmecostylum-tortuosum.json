    "intro": "Myrmecostylum tortuosum, commonly known as the zigzag lichen, is a unique lichen species characterized by its intricate, branching growth pattern. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is known for its distinctive, often meandering thallus structure. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria, which allows it to thrive in various environments. It is typically found on rocks and tree bark in temperate and subtropical regions. Its slow growth and specialized morphology make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
