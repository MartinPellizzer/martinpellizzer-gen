It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant has trifoliate leaves and produces small, round seeds that are often used in agricultural settings. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and disturbed areas. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used as a cover crop or for forage."
