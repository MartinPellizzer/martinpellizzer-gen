    "intro": "Marcgravia obovata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or skyflower, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale green, which bloom in clusters. Its roots are fibrous and can form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Marcgravia obovata is often found in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests and is valued for its ornamental leaves."
