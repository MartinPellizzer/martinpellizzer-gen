    "intro": "Metrosideros coriacea, commonly known as the rough bark pohutukawa, is a small evergreen tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white wax. The plant produces clusters of small, urn-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom throughout the year. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. The rough bark pohutukawa is an important species in New Zealand's native forests and is often found growing on rocky shores and cliffs."
