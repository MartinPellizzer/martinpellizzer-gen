    "intro": "Melicytus, commonly known as the k\u014dwhai tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Proteaceae, primarily found in New Zealand. These plants are characterized by their showy, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The leaves are typically simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture, while the bark is often fissured and rough. Melicytus species are generally evergreen shrubs or small trees, with some species reaching heights of up to 10 meters. They play an important ecological role in New Zealand's native forests, providing habitat and food for native wildlife."
