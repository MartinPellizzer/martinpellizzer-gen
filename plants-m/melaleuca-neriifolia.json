    "intro": "Melaleuca neriifolia, commonly known as the blackleaf paperbark, is a small to medium-sized tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a reddish or blackish inner layer. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically borne on the branches. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often covered with a fine layer of white wax. Melaleuca neriifolia is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it plays an important ecological role in its native habitat."
