    "intro": "Montia sarmentosa, commonly known as creeping montia, is a low-growing annual or biennial herb native to North America. It typically features prostrate or ascending stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a slightly hairy surface. Montia sarmentosa is adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
