    "intro": "Menyanthes sinarica, commonly known as the Chinese water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Menyanthaceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, dark green leaves that are often covered with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers with four petals, typically arranged in a cluster at the end of a slender stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Menyanthes sinarica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine in some Asian countries."
