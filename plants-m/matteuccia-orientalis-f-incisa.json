    "intro": "Matteuccia orientalis f. incisa, commonly known as the cut-leaf barrenwort, is a fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed, and often cut-like foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance. It is a perennial plant that produces small, greenish flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue, fleshy berries."
