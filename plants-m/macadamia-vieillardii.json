    "intro": "Macadamia vieillardii, commonly known as the giant macadamia, is a species native to the rainforests of New Caledonia. It is a large evergreen tree that can reach heights of up to 30 meters, featuring broad, leathery leaves and striking yellow flowers. The plant produces woody capsules that contain edible seeds, which are rich in oils and nutrients. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a significant species in the study of tropical botany. Due to its restricted distribution and conservation status, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes."
