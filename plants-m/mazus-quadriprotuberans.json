    "intro": "Mazus quadriprotuberans, commonly known as the four-bulb mazus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features a compact rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers arranged in clusters at the base of the stems during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
