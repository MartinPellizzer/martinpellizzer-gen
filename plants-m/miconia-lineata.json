    "intro": "Miconia lineata, commonly known as the broadleaf miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melastomataceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its large, broad leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and riverbanks. It has a woody stem and can grow as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to several meters. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
