    "intro": "Medicago falcata var. tenella, commonly known as the slender sickle vetch, is a perennial legume native to the eastern United States. It features slender, often creeping stems with small, trifoliate leaves that are typically pubescent. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, followed by small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open woods, fields, and along roadsides. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it a valuable plant for soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
