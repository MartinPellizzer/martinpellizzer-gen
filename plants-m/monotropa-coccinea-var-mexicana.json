    "intro": "Monotropa coccinea var. mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican ghost plant, is a hemiparasitic species that derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants. It is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, which gives it a pale, ghostly appearance, and it typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually red or orange in color, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise inconspicuous form. It is native to regions of Central America and is often found in association with specific host trees. Due to its unique ecological role and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
