    "intro": "Melampyrum sylvaticum f. subovatum, commonly known as the slender touch-me-not, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This subspecies is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it can derive some nutrients from its host plants while also performing photosynthesis."
