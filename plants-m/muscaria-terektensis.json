    "intro": "Muscaria terektensis, commonly known as the Terek fly agaric, is a species of mushroom belonging to the genus *Amanita* in the family Amanitaceae. It is characterized by a distinctive white cap with red or orange warts and a pale yellow to white stem. The fruiting bodies typically appear in forested areas, often in association with coniferous trees. The mushroom contains psychoactive compounds, primarily muscimol and ibotenic acid, which can induce hallucinogenic effects. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a potentially dangerous species and should be handled with caution."
