    "intro": "Metathelypteris adscendens, commonly known as the ascending water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that often float on the surface of still or slow-moving water. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that help it spread across aquatic environments. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that contribute to its intricate appearance. The plant plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
