    "intro": "Miconia ceramicarpa var. candolleana, commonly known as the Candolleana miconia, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, it is considered an invasive species in some areas."
