    "intro": "Mimulus laciniatus, commonly known as the shredded monkeyflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its striking, bright orange to yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely dissected, lance-shaped leaves that give it a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in streamside habitats. Mimulus laciniatus is a perennial herb that plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
