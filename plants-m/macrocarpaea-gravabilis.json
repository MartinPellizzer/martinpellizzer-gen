    "intro": "Macrocarpaea gravabilis, commonly known as the heavy-fruited macrocarpaea, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by distinctive, heavy, and elongated fruits. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its unique fruit structure, it is of interest in botanical studies related to seed dispersal mechanisms."
