It is a small, globular cactus with a ribbed structure and typically features white or pale green spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its delicate nature, it is often grown in containers to protect it from harsh outdoor conditions."
