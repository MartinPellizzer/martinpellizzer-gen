    "intro": "Microsteira ampihamensis, commonly known as the Ampihamena microsteira, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it receives indirect sunlight. Its leaves are simple and opposite, with a glossy surface that reflects light, aiding in photosynthesis in low-light conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Microsteira ampihamensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
