    "intro": "Mammillaria pulchella, commonly known as the Snowball Cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense clusters of white, woolly spines and small, pale green stems that often appear rounded or bulbous. The plant produces delicate, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for succulent gardens and indoor collections."
