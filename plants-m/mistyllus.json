    "intro": "Mistyllus, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that shimmer with a faint iridescence, giving it an otherworldly appearance. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that emit a subtle bioluminescent glow at night, a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its roots are highly specialized, capable of absorbing moisture from the humid air rather than soil. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, Mistyllus is considered a conservation priority in its native habitat."
