    "intro": "Mentha longifolia var. delphinensis, commonly known as water mint, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, slightly minty scent and serrated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. Its flowers are small, pale blue to purple, and arranged in whorls along the stem. It is often used in herbal remedies and as a culinary herb, though it is less commonly cultivated than other mint species."
