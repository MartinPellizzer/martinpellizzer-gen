    "intro": "Merremia subpalmata subsp. tenuisecta, commonly known as the slender-leaf morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It features heart-shaped leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in the morning. Its stems are hairy and can grow quite long, allowing it to climb various structures. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds."
