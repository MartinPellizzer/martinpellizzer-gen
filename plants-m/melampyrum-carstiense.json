    "intro": "Melampyrum carstiense, commonly known as the Carstens' touch-me-not, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture. Native to the Mediterranean region, it thrives in dry, open habitats such as rocky soils and grasslands."
