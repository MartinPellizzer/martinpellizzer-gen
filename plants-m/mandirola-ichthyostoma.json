    "intro": "Mandirola ichthyostoma, commonly known as the fish-mouth mandirola, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that resemble the mouth of a fish. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are glossy and oval-shaped, often with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Mandirola ichthyostoma is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral display."
