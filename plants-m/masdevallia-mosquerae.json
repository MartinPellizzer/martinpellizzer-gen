    "intro": "Masdevallia mosquerae, commonly known as the Mosquera\u2019s orchid, is a rare and striking species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its intricate, often colorful flowers with a unique, elongated shape. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its foliage consists of long, narrow leaves that help it absorb moisture from the air. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
