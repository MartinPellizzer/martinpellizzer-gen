    "intro": "Medicago suffruticosa var. benthamii, commonly known as the Bentham's goat's rue, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with woody stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, which are followed by narrow, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
