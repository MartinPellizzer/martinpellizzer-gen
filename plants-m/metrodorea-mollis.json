    "intro": "Metrodorea mollis, commonly known as the soft-leaf lichen, is a species of foliose lichen that belongs to the family Pilocarpaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, leaf-like thallus that is typically greenish to yellowish in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions. Its structure consists of a symbiotic association between a photosynthetic alga and a fungal partner. Metrodorea mollis plays a role in nutrient cycling and provides habitat for various microorganisms in its ecosystem."
