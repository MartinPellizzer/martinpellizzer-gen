    "intro": "Merremia aurea, commonly known as golden morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant blooms profusely during the day, particularly in warm climates, and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover in gardens. The seeds are enclosed in spherical, spiny fruits that mature in late summer."
