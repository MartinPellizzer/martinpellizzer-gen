The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing edible seeds. Its leaves are palmately lobed and are often used in traditional medicine. The tree is also valued for its strong, lightweight wood and its ability to thrive in arid environments."
