The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or woodland settings. Its aromatic foliage and medicinal properties have made it of interest in traditional herbal practices."
