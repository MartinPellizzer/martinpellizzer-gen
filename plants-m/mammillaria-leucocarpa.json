    "intro": "Mammillaria leucocarpa, commonly known as the white-fleshed globular cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its spherical shape and dense covering of white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its gray-green body. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
