    "intro": "Mozinna cinerea, commonly known as the gray mozinna, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender stems that are covered in a distinctive grayish-white pubescence. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish-white and appear in clusters. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its preferred habitat."
