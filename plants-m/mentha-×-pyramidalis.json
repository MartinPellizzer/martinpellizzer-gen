The plant produces small, pale purple flowers arranged in whorls along the stems, which bloom in late summer. It is often found in moist, sunny areas such as meadows and along stream banks. Mentha \u00d7 pyramidalis is valued for its aromatic properties and is used in herbal teas and traditional medicine."
