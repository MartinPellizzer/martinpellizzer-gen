    "intro": "Medicago ruthenica var. petraea, commonly known as the rock medic, is a perennial legume native to rocky and arid regions of the Mediterranean. It features trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment. It is often found in crevices and on slopes where other plants struggle to grow."
