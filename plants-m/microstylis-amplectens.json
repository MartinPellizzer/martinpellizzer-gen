It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as the sedge family. The plant is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, pale green to brownish spikelets. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The species is also valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in moist environments."
