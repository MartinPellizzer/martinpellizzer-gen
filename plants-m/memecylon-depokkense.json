    "intro": "Memecylon depokkense, commonly known as the Depokkense memecylon, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom during the rainy season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Memecylon depokkense is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as hill forests and undergrowth areas."
