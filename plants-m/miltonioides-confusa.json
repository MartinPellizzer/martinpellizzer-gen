    "intro": "Miltonioides confusa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its elongated, strap-like leaves and its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of air humidity and indirect light. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
