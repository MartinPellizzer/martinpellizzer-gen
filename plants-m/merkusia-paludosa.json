It typically grows in shallow, acidic soils and is often found in marshes and bogs. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. It plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various microorganisms. Merkusia paludosa is also an indicator species for healthy, undisturbed wetland ecosystems."
