    "intro": "Molinia caerulea var. litoralis, commonly known as sea moorgrass, is a coastal plant adapted to saline and sandy environments. It is a perennial grass with tufted, dark green foliage that forms dense mats. The plant produces tall, spike-like inflorescences bearing blue to purple florets, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in maritime climates and is often found in dunes and salt marshes. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize coastal soils and prevent erosion."
