    "intro": "Mulgedium multiflorum, commonly known as the many-flowered mulgedium, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Mulgedium multiflorum is often found in woodland edges and stream banks, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
