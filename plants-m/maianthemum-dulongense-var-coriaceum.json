    "intro": "Maianthemum dulongense var. coriaceum, commonly known as the toughleaf false lily of the wall, is a rare and diminutive woodland plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Convallariaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers in early spring, which are clustered in a raceme. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
