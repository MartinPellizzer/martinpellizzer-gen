    "intro": "Moltkia petraea f. oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock mullein, is a variant of the rock mullein plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces tall, erect flowering stems with clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
