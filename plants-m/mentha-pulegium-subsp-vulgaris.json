    "intro": "Mentha pulegium subsp. vulgaris, commonly known as pennyroyal, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and small, opposite leaves that are often aromatic and slightly serrated. The plant produces tiny, pale blue or white flowers in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Pennyroyal is known for its strong, mint-like fragrance, which comes from the essential oils present in its leaves. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a natural pest repellent."
