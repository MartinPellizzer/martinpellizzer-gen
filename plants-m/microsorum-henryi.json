    "intro": "Microsorum henryi, commonly known as the Henry's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds and streams. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water surface, which can help in water purification. The fronds are pinnately divided, with small, rounded lobes that give it a lacy appearance."
