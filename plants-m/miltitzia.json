It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and features ornamental flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plants are characterized by their opposite, simple leaves and showy, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Miltitzia species are often cultivated for their aesthetic value in gardens and landscapes. They prefer well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
