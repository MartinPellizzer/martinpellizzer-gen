    "intro": "Melaleuca foliolosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia, where it typically grows in coastal heathlands and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a papery texture beneath, and its narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. The plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to coastal environments."
