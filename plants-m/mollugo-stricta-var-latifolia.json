    "intro": "Mollugo stricta var. latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf carpetweed, is a low-growing annual plant native to the eastern United States. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly across disturbed soils. The leaves are oval to broadly elliptic, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and the plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in other open, disturbed areas. This species is notable for its rapid growth and ability to colonize areas quickly, making it both a common weed and a pioneer plant in ecological succession."
