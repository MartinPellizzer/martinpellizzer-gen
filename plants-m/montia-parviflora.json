    "intro": "Montia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered watercress, is a low-growing annual plant native to the moist, rocky habitats of western North America. It features small, alternate leaves that are typically rounded or ovate, and it produces tiny white or pale pink flowers clustered in terminal inflorescences. The plant is adapted to wet environments, often found in stream banks, meadows, and forest floors where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its rapid growth and short life cycle make it a common pioneer species in disturbed soils. The plant's foliage is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies, though its primary ecological role is as a food source for various invertebrates and small mammals."
