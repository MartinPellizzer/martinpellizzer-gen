It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, particularly China, India, and Southeast Asia. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, with compound leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. Its roots are often harvested for their medicinal properties, similar to true ginseng. Metapanax species are valued in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
