    "intro": "Miconia leafloribunda, commonly known as the broadleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a fleshy, orange-red berry that contains several seeds. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in certain regions."
