    "intro": "Maxillaria crocea var. lietzei, commonly known as the Lietzei Maxillaria, is a hybrid orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit and produces fragrant, dark red to violet flowers with yellow and white markings. The plant typically blooms during the summer months, and its pseudobulbs are covered in a dense, velvety layer of brownish-red hair. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining potting media, making it a popular choice for intermediate orchid growers. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and unique floral coloration."
