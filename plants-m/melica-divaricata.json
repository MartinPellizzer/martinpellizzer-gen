    "intro": "Melica divaricata, commonly known as the bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often bent stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as meadows, woodlands, and streambanks. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. Melica divaricata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
