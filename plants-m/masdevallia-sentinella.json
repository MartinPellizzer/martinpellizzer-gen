    "intro": "Masdevallia sentinella, commonly known as the Sentinel Masdevallia, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its intricate, dark green foliage and vividly colored, spurred orchid flowers that range from red to purple. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is also considered endangered in the wild."
