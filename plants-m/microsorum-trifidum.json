    "intro": "Microsorum trifidum, commonly known as the three-lobed sword fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, serrated fronds that are often divided into three distinct lobes. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize sediment and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Microsorum trifidum is valued in aquariums for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in a variety of water conditions."
