    "intro": "Miconia fenestrata, commonly known as the windowleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with distinctive fenestrations, or leaf windows, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by bright red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in some regions, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
