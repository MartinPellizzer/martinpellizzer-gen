    "intro": "Macfadyena pubescens, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems, which are often covered in fine, soft hairs, and its striking clusters of bright yellow, tubular flowers. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and small mammals. Its leaves are typically alternate, simple, and ovate, with a slightly hairy texture. Macfadyena pubescens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
