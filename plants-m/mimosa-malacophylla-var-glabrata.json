    "intro": "Mimosa malacophylla var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth-leaf mimosa, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its soft, glabrous (hairless) leaves that are typically oval or elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, pale pink seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid regions. Its foliage and flowers provide habitat and food for various pollinators and small wildlife."
