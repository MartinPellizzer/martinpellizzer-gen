    "intro": "Myristica cimicifera var. insipida, commonly known as the nutmeg tree variant, is a member of the Myristicaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage and can grow up to 20 meters in height, with a dense canopy that provides shade. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by large, woody fruits containing aromatic seeds. The seeds, while less pungent than the typical nutmeg, are still valued for their subtle fragrance and culinary use. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and economic contexts."
