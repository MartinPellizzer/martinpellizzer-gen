    "intro": "Monnina tuberosa, commonly known as purple morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its distinctive violet or purple flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant has a sprawling growth habit with hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. Its tuberous roots are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though it is primarily grown for its ornamental value. Monnina tuberosa thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid regions."
