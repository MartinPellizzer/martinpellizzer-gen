    "intro": "Momordica acuminata, commonly known as the horned melon or karela, is a tropical vine native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive warty, spiky fruit that resembles a hornet\u2019s nest, hence its common name. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that develop into the edible, gourd-like fruits. The fruit's interior contains a sweet, fleshy pulp with black seeds, and it is often used in traditional cuisines. Botanically, it belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, sharing close relations with other cucurbits like cucumbers and watermelons."
