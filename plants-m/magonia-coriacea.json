    "intro": "Magonia coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf magonia, is a perennial shrub native to the temperate regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a textured appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its woody stems are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Magonia coriacea thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and rocky slopes."
