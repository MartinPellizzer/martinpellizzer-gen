    "intro": "Medicosma petiolaris, commonly known as the leafy spurge, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. It is an annual or biennial species that thrives in disturbed soils and dry environments. Due to its rapid growth and invasive nature, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
