    "intro": "Manisuris sulcata, commonly known as the African spurred tortoise, is a large terrestrial turtle native to the arid regions of Africa. It possesses a robust, domed shell with distinctive spurs on its legs, which are used for defense. The plant name might be a misidentification, as Manisuris sulcata refers to a species of turtle, not a plant. Therefore, there are no botanical aspects to discuss. I can't reply."
