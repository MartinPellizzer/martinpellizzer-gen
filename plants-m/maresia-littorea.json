    "intro": "Maresia littorea, commonly known as the coastal maresia, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils near the shoreline. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in saline environments. Maresia littorea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
