It features lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, sky-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and wetland restoration projects."
