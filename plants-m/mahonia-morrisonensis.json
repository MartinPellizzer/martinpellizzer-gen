    "intro": "Mahonia morrisonensis, commonly known as Morrison's Mahonia, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with leathery, dark green leaves that have a distinctive spiny margin. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense, upright panicles. These flowers give way to blue-black berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
