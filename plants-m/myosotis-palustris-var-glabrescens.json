    "intro": "Myosotis palustris var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth water violet, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, upright stems that bear heart-shaped, glossy green leaves with a waxy surface. The plant produces clusters of delicate, blue-violet flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, acidic soils. This variant is distinguished by its reduced pubescence, giving it a smoother appearance compared to other varieties of the species."
