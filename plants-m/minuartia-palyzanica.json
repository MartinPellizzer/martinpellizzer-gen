    "intro": "Minuartia palyzanica, commonly known as the white sand saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with numerous creeping stems that root at the nodes. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. Minuartia palyzanica is adapted to harsh conditions, thriving in rocky or sandy soils where few other plants can survive."
