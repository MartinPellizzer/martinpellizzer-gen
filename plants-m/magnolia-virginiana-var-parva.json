    "intro": "Magnolia virginiana var. parva, commonly known as the dwarf southern magnolia, is a compact evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It features large, glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces showy, white, cup-shaped flowers in early spring, which are highly fragrant and attract pollinators. Its slow growth rate and dense, pyramidal form make it suitable for ornamental landscaping. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a versatile choice for garden use."
