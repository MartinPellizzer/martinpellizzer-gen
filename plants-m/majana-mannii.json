It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers and pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically green when unripe and turn yellow when mature. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties, though its botanical features are less well-documented compared to other Rutaceae species."
