    "intro": "Microlaena tasmanica var. subalpina, commonly known as the subalpine microlaena, is a perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of southern Australia. It typically grows in open, dry habitats such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is well adapted to cold, nutrient-poor environments and plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native range."
