    "intro": "Mimosa aurivillus var. calothamnos, commonly known as the golden mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by the plant's sensitivity to touch. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
