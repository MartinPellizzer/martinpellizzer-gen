It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are follicles that release seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
