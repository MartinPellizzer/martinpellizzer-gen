    "intro": "Miconia lehmannii, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit tree, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into fleshy, star-shaped fruits. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal make it an invasive species in some regions. The plant's botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a challenge for land management."
