    "intro": "Malus montana, commonly known as the mountain crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It typically grows to a height of 2\u20136 meters and features showy white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces small, tart apples that are often used in jams and culinary applications. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and the bark is smooth and greyish-brown. Malus montana is valued for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
