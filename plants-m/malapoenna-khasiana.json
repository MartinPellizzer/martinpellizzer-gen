    "intro": "Malapoenna khasiana, commonly known as the Khasi mountain orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the northeastern region of India. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest areas, preferring cool and humid conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
