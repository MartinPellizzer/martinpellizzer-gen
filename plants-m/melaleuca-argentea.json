It is native to eastern Australia, particularly Queensland and New South Wales, where it grows in coastal and heathland environments. The plant is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from a dense covering of fine, soft hairs. Its small, white or pale pink flowers appear in spikes during the spring and summer months. Melaleuca argentea is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types."
