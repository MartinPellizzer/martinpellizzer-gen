It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and relatively small size. The plant produces pseudobulbs that support its foliage and flowers, which are typically fragrant and come in a range of colors, including white, pink, and purple. Maxillaria breviscapa thrives in humid, shady environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique floral structure and ornamental value make it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
