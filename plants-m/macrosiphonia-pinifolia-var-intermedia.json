It features a pale to dark green thallus with a distinctive, elongated, leaf-like structure. The plant forms a dense, cushion-like growth and is often found on bark, soil, or rock surfaces. It has a slow growth rate and is typically found in temperate forest regions. This lichen is known for its ability to tolerate moderate levels of pollution, making it a useful indicator species for environmental conditions."
