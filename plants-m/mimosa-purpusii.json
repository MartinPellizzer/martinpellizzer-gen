    "intro": "Mimosa purpusii, commonly known as the yellow mimosa, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a shrub that typically grows up to 1.5 meters tall, with slender, branching stems and small, fern-like leaves. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in spherical inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and scrub habitats. Mimosa purpusii is also known for its sensitivity to touch, as its leaves fold when disturbed, a trait shared with other species in the Mimosa genus."
