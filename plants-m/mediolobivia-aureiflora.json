It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers, which bloom in clusters during the rainy season. The plant has narrow, waxy leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is known for its unique, branched structure. Due to its limited habitat and susceptibility to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
