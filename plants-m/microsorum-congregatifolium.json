    "intro": "Microsorum congregatifolium, commonly known as the clustered sword fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth pattern and feathery, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as streams and ponds. Its rhizomes form a network that helps anchor it to substrates and facilitates nutrient absorption. Microsorum congregatifolium is often used in aquascaping due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of water conditions."
