    "intro": "Microlepis mosenii var. acutifolia, commonly known as the sharp-leaved microlepis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It features small, narrow leaves with a sharp, pointed tip, which gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
