    "intro": "Monachanthus discolor, commonly known as the whiteleaf ironwood, is a rare and woody shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive white or pale green leaves, which contrast with its dark, rugged bark. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested wetlands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
