    "intro": "Milium effusum var. confertum, commonly known as the dense hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
