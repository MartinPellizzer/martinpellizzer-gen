    "intro": "Margarocarpus exasperatus, commonly known as the rough-seeded cycad, is a unique plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that are often covered in a thick, waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female plants. Its seeds are encased in a hard, spiky outer layer, which is a distinguishing feature of the species. Margarocarpus exasperatus is native to parts of Africa and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
