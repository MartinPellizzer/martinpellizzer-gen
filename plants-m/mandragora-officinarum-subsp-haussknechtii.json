    "intro": "Mandragora officinarum subsp. haussknechtii, commonly known as the Hausknecht's mandrake, is a rare and distinctive member of the nightshade family. It is characterized by its deeply lobed leaves and striking, bell-shaped flowers that range from purple to white. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that contain the toxic alkaloids responsible for its historical use in medicine and magic. Native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia, it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is often protected in its natural habitats."
