    "intro": "Meliosma velutina, commonly known as the velvetleaf meliosma, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often hairy leaves that give it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in early spring, followed by dark blue, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. Its root system is fibrous and can spread extensively, making it a persistent weed in disturbed soils. Meliosma velutina is often found in moist woodland areas and along streambanks."
