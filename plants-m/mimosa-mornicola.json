    "intro": "Mimosa mornicola, commonly known as the morning glory, is a flowering plant characterized by its rapid leaf closure in response to touch, a phenomenon known as thigmonastic movement. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, often blooming in the early morning. Its stems are typically hairy and can climb or trail, making it a popular ornamental plant. The seeds are enclosed in a pod that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind or animal contact."
