    "intro": "Miltonia loddigesii, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a tropical orchid native to the Amazon basin. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that resemble pink and white slippers, often with a contrasting lip. The plant typically grows as a sympodial orchid, forming pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are broad and oval, arranged in a fan-like pattern around the stem. This species thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and well-draining soil."
