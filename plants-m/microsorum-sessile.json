    "intro": "Microsorum sessile, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It has finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the substrate, helping to stabilize the sediment. Microsorum sessile is often used in water gardens and aquariums due to its ornamental value and ability to provide shelter for aquatic life."
