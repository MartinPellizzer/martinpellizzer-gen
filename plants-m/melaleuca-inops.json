    "intro": "Melaleuca inops, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive, peeling bark that reveals a smooth, whitish inner layer. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters, which are typically followed by cylindrical, woody fruits. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a slightly rough texture. Melaleuca inops is adapted to a range of soil types and is often found in coastal and heathland environments."
