    "intro": "Menonvillea orbiculata f. glabra, commonly known as the smooth-leaved menonvillea, is a bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit and thick, waxy leaves that are smooth to the touch. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant orange-red flowers that bloom in the summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
