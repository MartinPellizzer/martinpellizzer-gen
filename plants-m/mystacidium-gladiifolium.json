    "intro": "Mystacidium gladiifolium, commonly known as the swordleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in the southeastern United States. It has slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically evergreen and arranged alternately along its stems. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. It relies on its host for water and nutrients but can photosynthesize to some extent. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to a parasitic lifestyle while maintaining some degree of autotrophy."
