    "intro": "Malaxis koordersii var. celebensis, commonly known as the Celebes Malaxis, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are ovate and arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces a single, racemose inflorescence with numerous tiny blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
