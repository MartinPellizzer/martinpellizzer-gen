    "intro": "Mendoravia, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage and delicate, fragrant blooms that appear in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its unique morphology includes long, slender stems and clustered flowers that resemble small bells. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, Mendoravia is considered a conservation concern."
