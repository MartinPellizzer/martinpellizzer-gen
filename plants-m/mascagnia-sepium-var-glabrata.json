    "intro": "Mascagnia sepium var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth mascagnia, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically glabrous, or hairless, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed sites. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive and ecologically valuable species in its native habitat."
