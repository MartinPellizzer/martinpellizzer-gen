    "intro": "Mimosa gardneri, commonly known as the pink mimosa, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through its root nodules. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its unique, sensitive leaves fold shut when touched, a trait that adds to its appeal in gardens."
