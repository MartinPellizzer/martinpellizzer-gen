    "intro": "Macrocentrum parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered macrocentrum, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Melanthiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and small, clustered white or pale green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly across the ground. The flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators like bees and flies."
