    "intro": "Miconia susannae, commonly known as the pink miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which are typically borne at the tips of the branches. Its fruit is a small, berry-like structure that turns red when mature, containing several seeds. Miconia susannae is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage and floral display."
