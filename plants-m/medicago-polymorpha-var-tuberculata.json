    "intro": "Medicago polymorpha var. tuberculata, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and clusters of small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant produces elliptical, hairy pods that contain lens-shaped seeds. It is often used as a cover crop due to its nitrogen-fixing ability and erosion control properties. Its adaptability to various soil types makes it a valuable plant in both agricultural and ecological contexts."
