It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor in moist, shaded environments. Its growth is slow, and it can live for several decades, making it a long-lived species. The fronds are used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants in gardens."
