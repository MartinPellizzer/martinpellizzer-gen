    "intro": "Mahonia repens var. typica, commonly known as creeping mahonia, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It features compound leaves that are typically 3 to 5 inches long, with glossy, dark green foliage and spiny margins. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by blue-black berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in woodland gardens for its ornamental value. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, making it suitable for ground cover in moist, well-drained soils."
