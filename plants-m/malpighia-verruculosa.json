    "intro": "Malpighia verruculosa, commonly known as the Brazilian wolfberry or pitaya, is a small, shrub-like plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It produces small, red, fleshy berries that are rich in antioxidants and have a sweet, tart flavor. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and the plant is often cultivated for both ornamental and culinary purposes. The fruit is typically harvested when fully ripe, and it plays a role in traditional medicine in some indigenous communities."
