    "intro": "Mercurialis pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered mercury plant, is a flowering plant species native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing annual herb characterized by its small, yellowish-green flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. Mercurialis pauciflora is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open fields."
