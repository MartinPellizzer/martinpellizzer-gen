    "intro": "Mammillaria marksiana, commonly known as the Mexican snowball cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular stem covered with white, woolly tubercles that give it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
