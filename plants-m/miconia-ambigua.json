    "intro": "Miconia ambigua, commonly known as the false hibiscus, is a species of flowering plant in the Melastomataceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its large, velvety leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. It is often found in lowland rainforests and is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
