    "intro": "Modecca australis, commonly known as the Australian modecca, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, which bloom during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of white wax. Modecca australis is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in dune environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing coastal landscapes."
