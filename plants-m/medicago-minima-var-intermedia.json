    "intro": "Medicago minima var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate medick, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically heart-shaped with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
