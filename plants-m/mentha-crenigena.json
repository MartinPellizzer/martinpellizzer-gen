    "intro": "Mentha crenigena, commonly known as catnip, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its square, hollow stems and opposite, serrated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in whorls along the stems. Mentha crenigena is known for its strong aromatic properties, primarily due to the presence of nepetalactone. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woods, and along stream banks."
