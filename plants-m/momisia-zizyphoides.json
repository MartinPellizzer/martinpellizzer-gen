    "intro": "Momisia zizyphoides, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia, including China and India. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers and smooth, reddish-brown bark. The tree produces small, yellowish-green fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and rich color, making it a sought-after material in traditional crafts and furniture. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species."
