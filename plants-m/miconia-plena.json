    "intro": "Miconia plena, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a distinctive, fleshy, orange-red berry that contains numerous small seeds. Miconia plena is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage and adaptability to a range of growing conditions."
