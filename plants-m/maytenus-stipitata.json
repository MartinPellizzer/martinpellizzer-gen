It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by small, round, woody fruits. Its bark is often rough and fissured, and it has a shallow root system that allows it to thrive in well-drained soils. Maytenus stipitata is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes."
