    "intro": "Mammillaria lasiacantha subsp. viescensis, commonly known as the Viesca's mammillaria, is a small, globular cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico. It features a dense covering of white to pale blue spines, which help protect it from intense sunlight and herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its greenish-gray body. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated by cactus enthusiasts."
