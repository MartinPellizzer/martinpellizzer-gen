    "intro": "Myobroma albana, commonly known as the white-flowered myobroma, is a rare and delicate plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a humid, temperate climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
