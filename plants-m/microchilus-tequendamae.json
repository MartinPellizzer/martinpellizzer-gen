    "intro": "Microchilus tequendamae, commonly known as the Tequendama fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of Colombia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, often found in cloud forests at elevations above 2,500 meters. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Microchilus tequendamae is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range."
