    "intro": "Melittis melissophyllum subsp. carpatica, commonly known as the Carpathian honeyflower, is a perennial herb native to the Carpathian Mountains in Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its glandular-hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces showy, two-lipped flowers that are typically pink or purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and forest edges. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
