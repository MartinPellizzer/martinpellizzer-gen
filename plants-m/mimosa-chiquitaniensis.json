    "intro": "Mimosa chiquitaniensis, commonly known as the Chiquitania mimosa, is a shrub native to the dry forests of South America, particularly in Bolivia and Paraguay. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant features small, fern-like leaves that close when touched, a response mediated by sensitive tendrils called pulvini. Its flowers are typically pale yellow or white, arranged in spherical clusters, and it produces elongated pods that contain seeds. Mimosa chiquitaniensis is adapted to arid environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils."
