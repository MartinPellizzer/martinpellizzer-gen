    "intro": "Masdevallia descendens, commonly known as the hanging masdevallia, is a terrestrial orchid native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its pendulous inflorescence, which bears clusters of delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant has a short, rhizomatous stem and produces small, strap-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. Its flowers typically bloom during the cooler months, and it thrives in high humidity and dappled shade. Due to its unique appearance and growth habit, it is a popular choice for hanging baskets and shaded garden settings."
