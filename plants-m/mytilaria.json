    "intro": "Mytilaria, commonly known as the wax apple or sugar apple, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Sapotaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. Mytilaria species are characterized by their glossy, elliptical leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow. The fruit is a spherical, fleshy berry that turns from green to yellow or red when ripe, often with a waxy coating. The genus includes several species, such as Mytilaria laurifolia, which is widely cultivated for its ornamental and edible qualities."
