    "intro": "Myrceugenia maritima, commonly known as the coastal myrtle, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern South America. It is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are typically elliptical and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible, dark blue berries. Myrceugenia maritima thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to salt spray, making it a common species in coastal ecosystems. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
