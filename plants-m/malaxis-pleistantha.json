    "intro": "Malaxis pleistantha, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is an orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, pouch-like flower that resembles a slipper, typically pink or purple in color. The plant has a compact growth habit with a single stem and is often found in moist, shaded forest environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and wasps. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
