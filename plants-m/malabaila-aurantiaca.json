    "intro": "Malabaila aurantiaca, commonly known as the golden bell tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its showy, pendulous yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, giving it a striking appearance. The tree has a thick, smooth bark that becomes fissured with age, and its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate in shape. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural dispersal."
