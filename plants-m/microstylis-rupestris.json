    "intro": "Microstylis rupestris, commonly known as the rock microstylis, is a small, flowering plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features compact, upright stems with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are usually pale blue or purple, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. Microstylis rupestris is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
