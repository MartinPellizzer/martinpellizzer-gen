    "intro": "Mitella trifida, commonly known as the three-leaved bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, which is a distinguishing feature. Mitella trifida is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local pollinators."
