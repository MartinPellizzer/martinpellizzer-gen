    "intro": "Macodes veitchii, commonly known as the Veitch's banyan, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Malay Archipelago. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round berries. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage and unique growth habit. Macodes veitchii is also noted for its ability to form aerial roots, which can lead to the development of a buttressed trunk in mature specimens."
