    "intro": "Mitrella kentii, commonly known as Kent's mitrella, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly found in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
