    "intro": "Morus alba f. pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramidal white mulberry, is a cultivar of the white mulberry tree. It is characterized by its narrow, upright growth habit, forming a conical shape that makes it suitable for small spaces. The leaves are typically ovate with a pointed tip and a serrated margin. It produces small, aggregate fruits that are edible for silkworms but not generally consumed by humans. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its structured appearance."
