    "intro": "Malvastrum joergensenii, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky slopes. The plant features hairy, lobed leaves and produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. Its fibrous roots help it retain moisture in dry conditions, and it is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a characteristic species of the Chihuahuan Desert ecosystem."
