It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and alternate, ovate leaves. The tree produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in spring, followed by edible, ornamental fruits that ripen in autumn. The fruit has a tough, inedible outer husk and a soft, sweet interior when fully mature. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
