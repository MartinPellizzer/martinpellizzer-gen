    "intro": "Mezoneuron welwitschianum, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a large evergreen tree native to central and southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. The tree produces small, fragrant yellow flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It is valued for its durable, heavy timber, which is used in construction and furniture-making. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered vulnerable and is protected in many regions."
