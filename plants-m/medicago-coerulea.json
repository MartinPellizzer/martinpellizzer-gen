    "intro": "Medicago coerulea, commonly known as blue medick, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial legume that produces small, blue to purple flowers throughout the summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, round pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed areas. Medicago coerulea is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and as a forage plant."
