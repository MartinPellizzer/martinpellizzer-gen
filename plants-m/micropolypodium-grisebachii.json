    "intro": "Micropolypodium grisebachii, commonly known as the gray-moss fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that often form dense, moss-like clusters on tree trunks or branches. The plant's rhizomes are wiry and often covered in a fine, grayish pubescence, which gives it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. The fronds are typically lanceolate or ovate, with a leathery texture and a distinct, serrated margin."
