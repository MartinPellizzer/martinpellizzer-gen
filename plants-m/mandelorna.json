    "intro": "Mandelorna, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features large, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink, white, and yellow, often floating on the surface of still water. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that provide shade and habitat for aquatic life. Its roots are submerged, absorbing nutrients from the water while supporting the plant's growth. Mandelorna is revered in many cultures for its symbolic and spiritual significance."
