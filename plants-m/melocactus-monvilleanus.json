    "intro": "Melocactus monvilleanus, commonly known as the Monville's melon cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem that often develops a rounded, bulbous shape as it matures. The plant produces vibrant yellow to orange flowers during the spring and early summer. Its spines are typically short and straight, providing some protection from herbivores. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem."
