    "intro": "Merremia medium, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy texture and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun for optimal growth. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in agricultural settings. The fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which can remain viable for several years."
