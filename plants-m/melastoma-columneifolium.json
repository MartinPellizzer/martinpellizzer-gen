It features opposite, elliptic to ovate leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, typically in shades of pink or white. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in suitable habitats."
