    "intro": "Marsilea salvatrix, commonly known as the water clover, is a floating aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its four-leaf clover-like appearance, with small, heart-shaped leaves that often float on the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. It plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and aiding in water filtration. Marsilea salvatrix is also used in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals from contaminated water."
