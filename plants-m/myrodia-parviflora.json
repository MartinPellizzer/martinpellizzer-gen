It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a woody stem and is typically found in sandy or rocky soils. Myrodia parviflora is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Its leaves are often used in traditional Aboriginal medicine for their aromatic and therapeutic properties."
