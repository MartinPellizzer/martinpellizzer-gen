    "intro": "Mimosa alleniana, commonly known as the Allen's sensitive plant, is a species native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait known as thigmonastic response. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or along stream banks. Its flowers are small and yellow, appearing in clusters, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Mimosa alleniana is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in partial shade."
