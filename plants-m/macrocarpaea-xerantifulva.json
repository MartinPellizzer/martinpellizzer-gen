It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant is adapted to withstand drought conditions, storing water in its thick stems and leaves. It typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. The flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds."
