    "intro": "Melandrium dioicum f. lacteum, commonly known as the milky catchfly, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive pink to red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has alternate, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. One of its notable features is the milky sap it exudes when damaged, which gives it its common name. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a winter annual, completing its life cycle within a single growing season."
