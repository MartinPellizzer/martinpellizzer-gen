    "intro": "Myriactis gmelinii, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with deep root systems and reduced leaf surface area. Myriactis gmelinii plays an important ecological role in supporting desert ecosystems and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
