    "intro": "Micropera utriculosa, commonly known as the bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are simple and often submerged, while the stems may be floating or rooted. Micropera utriculosa is a carnivorous plant that relies on its bladders to obtain nutrients from captured prey."
