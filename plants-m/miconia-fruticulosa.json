    "intro": "Miconia fruticulosa, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or *Miconia* shrub, is a tropical evergreen plant native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and broad, glossy leaves that are often deeply lobed. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain regions."
