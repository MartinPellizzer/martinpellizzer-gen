    "intro": "Microstylis foetida, commonly known as the stinking rush, is a flowering plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant is native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in the Americas. Its most notable botanical feature is its strongly aromatic or even foul-smelling foliage, which gives it its common name. Microstylis foetida typically grows in marshy or swampy areas, often forming dense stands that contribute to the structure of wetland ecosystems."
