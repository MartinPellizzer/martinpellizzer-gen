    "intro": "Mentha gentilis var. vesana, commonly known as the alpine peppermint, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers arranged in whorls along the stems, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its aromatic leaves and medicinal properties, it has been used historically in traditional herbal remedies."
