    "intro": "Metastelma alainii, commonly known as the Alain's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Viscaceae family. It grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces white or yellowish berries that are dispersed by birds. Its parasitic nature allows it to absorb water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis. Due to its specific ecological role, it is often found in fragmented forests and is considered a rare species."
