    "intro": "Madronella leucocephala, commonly known as the white-headed madrone, is a striking evergreen shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, leathery berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in coastal chaparral habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
