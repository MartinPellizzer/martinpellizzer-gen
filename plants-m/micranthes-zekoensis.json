    "intro": "Micranthes zekoensis, commonly known as the Zeko mountain sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine soils, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are usually basal, with a dense, compact growth habit, and it produces numerous tiny flowers in clusters. Micranthes zekoensis is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and adaptations to harsh mountain climates."
