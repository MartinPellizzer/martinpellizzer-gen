It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that often form dense clumps, with leaves that are narrow and grass-like. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically white or pale green. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or on rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
