It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with a distinctive striated pattern on the leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. Medicago tornata var. striata is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
