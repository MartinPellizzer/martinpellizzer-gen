    "intro": "Mormolyca tenuibulba, commonly known as the slender-bulb mormolyca, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of South America. It features a fibrous root system and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its compact appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
