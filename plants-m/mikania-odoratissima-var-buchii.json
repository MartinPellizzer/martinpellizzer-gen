It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits that are typically hairy and contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its aromatic leaves and rapid growth make it both a useful and sometimes invasive species in its native habitat."
