    "intro": "Merciera tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mercier, is a flowering plant native to parts of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. It is often found in coastal and mountainous regions, where it adapts well to dry and nutrient-poor conditions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
