    "intro": "Mabea paniculata var. oblongifolia, commonly known as the oblong-leaf mabea, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its broad, oblong leaves that are often glossy and arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale green flowers, which are typically arranged in panicles. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical or subtropical regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it may be challenging to grow outside its native habitat."
