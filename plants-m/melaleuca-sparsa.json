    "intro": "Melaleuca sparsa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, papery bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are often followed by capsules containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a leathery texture and a bluish-green hue. Melaleuca sparsa is often found in coastal and sandy soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
