    "intro": "Melaleuca hispida, commonly known as the rough-leaved paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, flaky bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in dense clusters, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rough texture. Melaleuca hispida is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in coastal and dry inland regions."
