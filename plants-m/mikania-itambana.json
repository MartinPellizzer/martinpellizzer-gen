    "intro": "Mikania itambana, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant produces a milky sap that is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential weed in agricultural settings. Mikania itambana thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks."
