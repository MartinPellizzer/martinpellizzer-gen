    "intro": "Menyanthes trifoliata, commonly known as bog rosemary, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a whorl. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, waterlogged soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its preference for moist environments, it plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
