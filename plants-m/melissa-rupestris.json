    "intro": "Melissa rupestris, commonly known as limestone lemon balm, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It thrives in rocky, limestone-rich soils and is often found in dry, sunny environments. The plant features fragrant, narrow leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. Its aromatic foliage is similar to lemon balm, with a subtle citrus scent. Melissa rupestris is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in rocky landscapes."
