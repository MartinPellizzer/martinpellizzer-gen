    "intro": "Miconia bicolor, commonly known as the white miconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release numerous tiny seeds. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
