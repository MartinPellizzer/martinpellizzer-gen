    "intro": "Microlepia boryana, commonly known as the Bory's chain fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, hairy layer, which helps in moisture retention. Microlepia boryana is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
