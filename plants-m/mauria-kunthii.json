It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has a woody stem and produces small, spiny leaves adapted to conserve water in dry environments. It is often found in rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for xerophytic conditions. Its resilience to drought and heat makes it a valuable plant for ecological restoration in arid landscapes."
