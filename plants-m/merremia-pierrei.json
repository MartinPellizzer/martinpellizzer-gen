    "intro": "Merremia pierrei, commonly known as the yellow passion vine, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces fleshy, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to others. Its rapid growth habit makes it an effective cover plant in gardens or natural settings. Merremia pierrei is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
