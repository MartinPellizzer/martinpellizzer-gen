    "intro": "Myriopteris jamaicensis, commonly known as the Jamaican holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, rugged texture. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Myriopteris jamaicensis is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens."
