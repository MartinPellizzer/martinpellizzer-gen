    "intro": "Microtropis crassifolia, commonly known as the thick-leaved microtropis, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its often humid and tropical habitat. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. Microtropis crassifolia is typically found in lowland forests and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
