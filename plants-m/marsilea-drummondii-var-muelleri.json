    "intro": "Marsilea drummondii var. muelleri, commonly known as the water clover, is a aquatic fern species native to North America. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that resemble four-leaf clovers, which are typically divided into four oval segments. This variety thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands, where it forms dense mats on the water surface. The plant reproduces through spores, which are released into the water and germinate into new plants. Its botanical features make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
