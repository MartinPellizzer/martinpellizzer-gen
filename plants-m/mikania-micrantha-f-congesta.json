    "intro": "Mikania micrantha f. congesta, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a variant of the invasive Mikania micrantha species. It is a fast-growing vine characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces tiny, five-petaled white or pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. Its rapid spread makes it a significant weed in tropical and subtropical regions. Botanically, it is notable for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and its potential to outcompete native vegetation."
