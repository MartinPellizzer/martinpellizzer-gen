    "intro": "Micrelium asteroides, commonly known as the star-leaf fern, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It features delicate, fern-like leaves with a distinctive star-shaped pattern on the underside, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures are inconspicuous, relying on wind pollination for seed production. Micrelium asteroides is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local insect populations."
