    "intro": "Maytenus crassipes, commonly known as the thick-stemmed mayten, is a shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, though it is more closely related to the genus Maytenus. The plant is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy underside. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by woody, berry-like fruits that contain several seeds. Maytenus crassipes is often found in dry forests and is valued for its hard, durable wood."
