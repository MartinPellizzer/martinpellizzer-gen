    "intro": "Magnolia pugana, commonly known as the Mexican magnolia, is a deciduous tree native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is characterized by its large, showy white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The tree has a broad, rounded canopy and smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin. The plant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
