    "intro": "Mecodium wenhsienense, commonly known as the Wenhsien mecodium, is a rare flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its delicate, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture, while its stems are slender and often covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Mecodium wenhsienense is considered an endangered species."
