    "intro": "Mariscus pseudobrunneus, commonly known as the false sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the Montiaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are succulent, fleshy, and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Mariscus pseudobrunneus thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and desert regions."
