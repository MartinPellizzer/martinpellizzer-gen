    "intro": "Mikania obsoleta, commonly known as the slender Mikania, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, opposite leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, oval-shaped fruits. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it can become a problematic weed in some areas."
