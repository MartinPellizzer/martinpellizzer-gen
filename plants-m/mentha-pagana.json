    "intro": "Mentha pagana, commonly known as field mint, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, grassy areas and has a creeping habit with square stems and opposite leaves. The leaves are usually oval to lance-shaped, with a serrated margin and a strong, minty aroma. It produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorls along the stems, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. This plant is often used in herbal medicine for its digestive and calming properties."
