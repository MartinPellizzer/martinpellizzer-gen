    "intro": "Mammillaria wiesingeri subsp. apamensis, commonly known as the Apam\u00e9nsis Hedgehog Cactus, is a compact, spherical cactus native to Mexico. It features a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which bloom from areoles on the stem. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
