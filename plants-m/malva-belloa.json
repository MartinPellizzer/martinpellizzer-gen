    "intro": "Malva belloa, commonly known as the velvetleaf mallow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features heart-shaped leaves with a soft, velvety texture and prominent veins. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense, low-growing clumps."
