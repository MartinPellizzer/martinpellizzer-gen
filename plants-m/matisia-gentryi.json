    "intro": "Matisia gentryi, commonly known as the Gentry's matisia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Meliaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in countries like Colombia and Peru. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptical in shape. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, and it is known for its hard, woody fruit pods. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Matisia gentryi is considered a rare and understudied species in botanical research."
