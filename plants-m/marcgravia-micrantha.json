    "intro": "Marcgravia micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered rainforest vine, is a climbing plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its slender, twining stems that ascend through the canopy of rainforests. The plant produces small, showy flowers with five petals, often in shades of white or pale pink, which are typically borne in clusters. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a velvety texture, contributing to its aesthetic appeal in botanical gardens. Marcgravia micrantha plays a role in supporting local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insect and bird species."
