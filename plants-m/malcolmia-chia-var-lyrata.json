    "intro": "Malcolmia chia var. lyrata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed malcolmia, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, delicate yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. This variety is closely related to the more well-known Malcomia chia, but it is less commonly cultivated due to its smaller size and less showy blooms."
