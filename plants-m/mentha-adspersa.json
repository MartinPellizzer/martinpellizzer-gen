    "intro": "Mentha adspersa, commonly known as the woolly mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and strongly aromatic, menthol-rich leaves that are used in both culinary and medicinal applications. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in the summer months, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Mentha adspersa is valued for its hardiness and adaptability, making it a popular choice for garden cultivation."
