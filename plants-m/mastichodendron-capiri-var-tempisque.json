    "intro": "Mastichodendron capiri var. tempisque, commonly known as the Tempisque mastichodendron, is a rare and unique plant native to the Caribbean islands. It is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, and often fragrant leaves that are used in traditional medicine. The plant belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes other economically important species such as cashew and mango. Its botanical features include a woody stem with a rough, bark-like texture and small, clustered flowers that produce edible, aromatic fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native range."
