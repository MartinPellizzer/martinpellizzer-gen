    "intro": "Manihot esculenta subsp. grandifolia, commonly known as the giant arrowleaf, is a variant of the cassava plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces edible roots that are similar to regular cassava but often have a higher starch content. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil. Due to its robust growth, it is sometimes cultivated as a forage crop or for ornamental purposes."
