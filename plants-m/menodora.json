    "intro": "Menodora, commonly known as the devil's backbone, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia. The plants typically have erect or scrambling stems, often with glandular hairs, and produce small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale blue. The fruits are berries that contain several seeds, and the leaves are usually alternate and ovate or elliptic in shape. Menodora species are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
