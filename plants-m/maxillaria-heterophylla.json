    "intro": "Maxillaria heterophylla, commonly known as the variable maxillaria, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique leaf structure, with some leaves being broad and others narrow, depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces fragrant, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Maxillaria heterophylla is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to cultivation."
