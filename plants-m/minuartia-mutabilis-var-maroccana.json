    "intro": "Minuartia mutabilis var. maroccana, commonly known as the Moroccan rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the rocky habitats of North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found on limestone or sandstone substrates. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically succulent, adapted to store water in response to the dry climate. This variety is notable for its ability to tolerate extreme temperatures and poor soil conditions, making it a resilient species in its native range."
