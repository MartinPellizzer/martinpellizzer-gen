It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and clusters of white flowers. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible but often have a peppery taste. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in coastal areas and dry forests. Due to its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain regions."
