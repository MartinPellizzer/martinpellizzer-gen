    "intro": "Maesa arunachalensis, commonly known as the Arunachal Himalayan maesa, is a shrub native to the northeastern regions of India and adjacent areas of Bhutan and China. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes many acid-loving plants adapted to moist, temperate climates. The plant features small, elliptical leaves with a leathery texture and produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale pink flowers. It thrives in shaded, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous forest ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
