    "intro": "Marathrum glaucum, commonly known as the blue oat grass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, blue-gray foliage and delicate, feathery plumes that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, open areas such as prairies and rocky soils, preferring full sun. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it a useful plant for erosion control. Marathrum glaucum is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal and low maintenance requirements."
