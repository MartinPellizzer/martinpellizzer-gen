    "intro": "Malaxis lancifolia, commonly known as the sword-leafed marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in wet, forested areas and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a raceme, often appearing in late spring or early summer. It has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
