    "intro": "Muscaria emarginata, commonly known as the marginated fly agaric, is a species of psychedelic mushroom native to various regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by a distinctive white cap with a pale yellow or brown margin, and a bulbous stem covered in a membranous volva. The fruiting bodies typically appear in late summer and autumn, often growing in association with coniferous trees. The mushroom contains psychoactive compounds, including muscimol and ibotenic acid, which affect the central nervous system. Due to its hallucinogenic properties, it is considered a hallucinogenic species and is often sought after by mycologists and psychonauts alike."
