    "intro": "Mapouria microcephala, commonly known as the dwarf mapouria, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Africa. It features dense, dark green foliage with small, leathery leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, fragrant flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by small, round fruits. It is well adapted to dry conditions and thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
