    "intro": "Maillea crypsoides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its striking, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It requires specific environmental conditions, including high humidity and filtered sunlight, to thrive. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
