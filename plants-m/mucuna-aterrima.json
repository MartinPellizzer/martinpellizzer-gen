    "intro": "Mucuna aterrima, commonly known as the black velvet bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, dark purple to black pods that are covered in a velvety texture. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers and has trifoliate leaves with three oval-shaped leaflets. Mucuna aterrima is known for its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in agricultural systems. However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
