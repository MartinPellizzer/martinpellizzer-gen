    "intro": "Manisuris balansae, commonly known as the Balansae's manisuris, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in partial shade. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a glossy surface, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
