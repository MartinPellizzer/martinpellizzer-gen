    "intro": "Meconopsis impedita subsp. impedita, commonly known as the Himalayan blue poppy, is a member of the Papaveraceae family and is native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet petals, which are typically borne on slender, branching stems. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its flowers are short-lived, opening in the morning and closing by midday, a trait common in many high-altitude plants. Meconopsis impedita subsp. impedita is also notable for its medicinal uses in traditional herbal medicine."
