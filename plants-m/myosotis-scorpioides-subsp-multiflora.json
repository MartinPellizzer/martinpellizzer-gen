    "intro": "Myosotis scorpioides subsp. multiflora, commonly known as the greater water forget-me-not, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its clusters of small, sky-blue or white flowers that bloom throughout the summer. The plant typically grows in wet habitats such as marshes, ditches, and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
