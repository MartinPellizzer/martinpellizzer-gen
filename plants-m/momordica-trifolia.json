It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets, and its distinctive, spiny stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elongated, bitter-tasting fruits that are often used in traditional medicine. Its botanical features include the presence of cucurbitacin compounds, which contribute to its bitterness and medicinal properties. Momordica trifolia is also valued for its potential health benefits and is commonly cultivated in various parts of Asia."
