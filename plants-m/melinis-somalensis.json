    "intro": "Melinis somalensis, commonly known as the Somali grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Horn of Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, arid environments and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. Its seeds are small and dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas effectively. Melinis somalensis plays a role in stabilizing soils in degraded landscapes."
