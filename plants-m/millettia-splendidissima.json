It is characterized by its striking clusters of yellow flowers that resemble cascading showers, hence its common name. The plant has pinnately compound leaves and produces long, cylindrical pods that contain flattened seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The species is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial in agroforestry systems."
