    "intro": "Melilotus caeruleus var. densiflorus, commonly known as the dense-flowered sweet clover, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas. This variety is closely related to other melilot species and is valued for its ecological benefits and historical use in agriculture."
