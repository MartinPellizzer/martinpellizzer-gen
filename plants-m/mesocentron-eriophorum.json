It is characterized by its fluffy, white seed heads that resemble cotton, which are produced after the plant has bloomed. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and wet meadows. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Mesocentron eriophorum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
