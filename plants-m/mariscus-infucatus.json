    "intro": "Mariscus infucatus, commonly known as the golden sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, succulent leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Mariscus infucatus is adapted to thrive in sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping."
