    "intro": "Microstylis ottonis, commonly known as the Otto's microstylis, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with delicate, pale green to blueish flowers. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. Microstylis ottonis is typically found in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
