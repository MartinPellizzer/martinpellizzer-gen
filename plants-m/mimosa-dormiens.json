    "intro": "Mimosa dormiens, commonly known as the sleeping bush, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its unique response to touch, known as thigmonasty, is a fascinating botanical trait. Mimosa dormiens thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens."
