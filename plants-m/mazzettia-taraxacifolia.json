    "intro": "Mazzettia taraxacifolia, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Alps and adjacent mountain ranges. It features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by fluffy seed heads that disperse via the wind. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine climates. Mazzettia taraxacifolia is often found in open meadows and scree slopes at elevations above 1,500 meters."
