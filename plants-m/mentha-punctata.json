It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a serrated edge. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in whorls along the stems. Spearmint is known for its strong, refreshing aroma and is widely used in culinary and medicinal applications. Its essential oils, particularly menthol, contribute to its cooling and soothing properties."
