    "intro": "Mimosa calodendron, commonly known as the white mimosa, is a shrub native to South Africa. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are sensitive to touch, closing when disturbed. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in spring, adding a soft, ethereal appearance to the landscape. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value and unique leaf response make it a popular choice for gardens and botanical collections."
