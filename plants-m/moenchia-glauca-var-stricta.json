It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender, erect stems that are often tinged with a bluish hue. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a waxy coating that gives them a distinctive blue-green appearance. This variety is often found in moist soils along streambanks and in shaded woodland areas."
