    "intro": "Miconia amacurensis, commonly known as the red miconia, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, which can dominate understory vegetation in its native habitat. Its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature, contributing to its spread. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions, where it sometimes becomes an invasive species."
