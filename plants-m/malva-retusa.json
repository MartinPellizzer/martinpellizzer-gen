    "intro": "Malva retusa, commonly known as the soft-hairy mallow, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, velvety leaves covered in fine hairs, which give it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces showy pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges. Malva retusa is a herbaceous perennial that can grow up to 1 meter tall, with a spreading habit that makes it a useful plant in gardens and natural habitats."
