    "intro": "Mikania callineura, commonly known as the slender antelope's horn, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, slender stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Mikania callineura is also known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats, which can make it an invasive species in some areas."
