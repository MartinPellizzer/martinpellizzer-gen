    "intro": "Murdannia, commonly known as the mouse-ear or mouse-ear millet, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae. These plants are typically annual or perennial herbs with slender, grass-like stems and small, linear leaves. They are native to various regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia, often growing in disturbed soils or open habitats. Murdannia species are characterized by their tiny, spike-like inflorescences and wind-pollinated flowers. Some species are cultivated for their grains, which are used as food or animal feed."
