    "intro": "Mandevilla, commonly known as the flame vine, is a tropical flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit and produces vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The leaves are typically broad, heart-shaped, and glossy, providing a striking contrast to the colorful blooms. Mandevilla thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil and full sunlight for optimal growth. It is often cultivated in gardens or as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
