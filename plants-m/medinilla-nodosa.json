    "intro": "Medinilla nodosa, commonly known as the velvet tangerine or nodding medinilla, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and clusters of small, fragrant, white to pinkish flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces fleshy, orange-red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Medinilla nodosa thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive appearance and aromatic flowers. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for gardeners and horticulturists in tropical and subtropical regions."
