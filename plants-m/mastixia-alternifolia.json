It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its alternate arrangement of leaves, which are typically narrow and leathery. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
