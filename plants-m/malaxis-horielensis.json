    "intro": "Malaxis horielensis, commonly known as the Horei's lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that resemble a tresses of hair. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas, often in shaded and moist environments. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the poor soils of its habitat.
