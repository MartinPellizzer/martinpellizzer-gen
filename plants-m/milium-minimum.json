    "intro": "Milium minimum, commonly known as the dwarf plantain, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Milium minimum is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and its use in traditional herbal medicine."
