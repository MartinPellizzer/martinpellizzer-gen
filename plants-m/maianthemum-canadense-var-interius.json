    "intro": "Maianthemum canadense var. interius, commonly known as the Canada false shamrock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of about 15\u201330 centimeters and features trifoliate leaves composed of three heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers in late spring, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
