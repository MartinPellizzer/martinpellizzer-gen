    "intro": "Miconia buxifolia, commonly known as the waxleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by orange-red berries. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. However, it is considered invasive in some regions where it can outcompete native vegetation."
