    "intro": "Myrodia scabra, commonly known as the rough myrodia, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate floral display. Myrodia scabra is adapted to survive in dry, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant. It is often found in coastal and inland sandplain areas, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
