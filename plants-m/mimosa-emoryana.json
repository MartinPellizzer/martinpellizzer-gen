    "intro": "Mimosa emoryana, commonly known as the Emory mimosa, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often found in coastal areas and open woodlands. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by fluffy, pod-like fruits. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into many small leaflets, which give it a feathery appearance. Mimosa emoryana is also known for its sensitivity to touch, as its leaves quickly fold when disturbed."
