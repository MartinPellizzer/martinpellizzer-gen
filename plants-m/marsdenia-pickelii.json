    "intro": "Marsdenia pickelii, commonly known as the Pickel's Marsdenia, is a climbing shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by follicles containing seeds with tufts of silky hair. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
