    "intro": "Maba lokohensis, commonly known as the African yellowwood, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical rainforests of Central and West Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers that are followed by orange-red berries containing seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its hard, durable wood. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
