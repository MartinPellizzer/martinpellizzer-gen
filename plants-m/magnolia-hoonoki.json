    "intro": "Magnolia hoonoki, commonly known as the Hoonoki magnolia, is a rare and lesser-known species native to Japan. It is characterized by its large, showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves that provide a striking contrast to its fragrant blossoms. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in shaded to partially shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native range."
