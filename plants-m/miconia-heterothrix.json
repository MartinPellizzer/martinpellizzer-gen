It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that are typically borne on short pedicels. Its fruit is a bright red, fleshy berry that contains numerous small seeds. Miconia heterothrix is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions."
