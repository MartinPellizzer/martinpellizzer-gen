    "intro": "Melanoloma gattefossei, commonly known as the red-tailed spider orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the southeastern region of Australia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, velvety leaves and its distinctive red-tipped, spider-like flower spike. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pale green to yellow in color. It thrives in sandy soils and requires a sunny to semi-shaded environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
