    "intro": "Mespilus monogyna, commonly known as the white medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces edible fruits that ripen in the autumn, though they are often not fully mature until after the first frost. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, while its bark is smooth and grayish in color. The white medlar is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
