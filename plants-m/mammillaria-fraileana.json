    "intro": "Mammillaria fraileana, commonly known as the Mexican fairy duster, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are often surrounded by a dense cluster of spines. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and succulent collections."
