    "intro": "Metroxylon squarrosum, commonly known as the sago palm, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by spiny, three-lobed fruits. Its trunk contains a starchy pith, which is the source of sago, a material used in the production of starch and alcohol. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
