    "intro": "Magnolia shangpaensis, commonly known as the Shangpa magnolia, is a rare and ancient species native to the Himalayan regions of China and Nepal. It is characterized by its large, showy, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant is notable for its thick, leathery leaves and its ability to thrive in high-altitude, cool climates. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, with a slow growth rate and a long lifespan. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species, making it a subject of interest in botanical conservation efforts."
