    "intro": "Myroxylon rhombifolium, commonly known as the Copaiba tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and large, elliptical leaves that are alternately arranged along the branches. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into woody capsules containing aromatic resinous sap. This sap, known as copaiba balm, is highly valued for its medicinal and aromatic properties. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat and is also economically significant due to its resin yield."
