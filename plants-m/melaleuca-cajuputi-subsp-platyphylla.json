    "intro": "Melaleuca cajuputi subsp. platyphylla, commonly known as the broad-leaved paperbark, is a species of myrtles native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels off in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or cream-colored flowers in spikes, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a greyish-green hue with a rough texture. This subspecies is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
