    "intro": "Macrosciadium, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. It is characterized by its unique, showy inflorescence that resembles a ghostly face, hence its common name. The plants typically have arrow-shaped leaves and are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. Macrosciadium species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and swamps. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated as houseplants."
