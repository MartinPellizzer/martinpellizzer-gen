    "intro": "Mespilus spiralis, commonly known as the spiral serviceberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its slender, spiraling branches that give it a distinctive, almost helical appearance. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by edible berries that ripen in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly serrated edge. Mespilus spiralis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique form and seasonal interest."
