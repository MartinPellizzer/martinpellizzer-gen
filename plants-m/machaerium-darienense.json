    "intro": "Machaerium darienense, commonly known as the Darien machaerium, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in Colombia and Panama. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and often compound leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along riverbanks and in dense tropical forests. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, attracting various pollinators. The seeds are enclosed in pods and can be dispersed by wind or animals, contributing to its distribution in the wild."
