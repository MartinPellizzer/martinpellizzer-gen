    "intro": "Melanthesa rupestris, commonly known as the rock melanthus, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions of southern Africa. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are adapted to conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, pale yellow or greenish flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in loose, rocky soils. Melanthesa rupestris is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
