    "intro": "Muhlenbergia erecta, commonly known as the silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and fluffy, silver-tipped seed heads that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens. Its fine, grass-like leaves are typically a bluish-green color, adding visual interest throughout the growing season. Muhlenbergia erecta is also valued for its ability to attract wildlife, particularly birds, due to its seed production."
