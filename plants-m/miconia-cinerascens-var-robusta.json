    "intro": "Miconia cinerascens var. robusta, commonly known as the robust miconia, is a species native to tropical regions of South America. It is a large, fast-growing tree that can reach heights of up to 20 meters. The plant is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are typically green on the upper surface and lighter in color on the underside. It produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are dispersed by birds. Due to its rapid growth and potential invasiveness, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain ecosystems."
