    "intro": "Meiogyne heteropetala, commonly known as the variable-flowered cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feather-like leaves that can vary in shape and size. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female plants. Meiogyne heteropetala is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
