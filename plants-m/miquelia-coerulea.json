    "intro": "Miquelia coerulea, commonly known as the blue miquelia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a vibrant touch to its natural habitat. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly waxy texture. Miquelia coerulea is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
