    "intro": "Medicago hispida var. confinis, commonly known as the coastal medic, is a perennial legume native to the coastal regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal scrub habitats. Medicago hispida var. confinis plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing forage for wildlife."
