    "intro": "Myristica ardisiifolia, commonly known as the fragrant nutmeg tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant, red or orange flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that enclose a single seed, which is used in traditional medicine and as a spice. Its aromatic properties are due to the presence of volatile oils, particularly myristicin and elemicin, which are found in its seeds and leaves. Myristica ardisiifolia is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its visual appeal."
