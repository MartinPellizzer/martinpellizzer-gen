    "intro": "Maesa acuminatissima, commonly known as the sharp-pointed maesa, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and has glossy, elliptical leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red or orange berries. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The shrub thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
