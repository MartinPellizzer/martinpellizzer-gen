    "intro": "Mimosa pterocarpa, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by touch-sensitive cells called pulvini. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, followed by distinctive pod-like fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in warm, sunny climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The species is also used in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock."
