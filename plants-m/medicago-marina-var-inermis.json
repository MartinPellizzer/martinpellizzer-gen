    "intro": "Medicago marina var. inermis, commonly known as sea medic, is a halophytic plant adapted to thrive in coastal environments. It possesses salt-tolerant properties, allowing it to grow in saline soils and tidal zones. The plant has small, trifoliate leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Its root system helps stabilize sandy or muddy shores, preventing erosion. It is often found in the Mediterranean region and other coastal areas with a temperate climate."
