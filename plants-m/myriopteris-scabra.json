    "intro": "Myriopteris scabra, commonly known as the scaly holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, scaly structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. Native to the southeastern United States, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. The plant's rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly over time. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns."
