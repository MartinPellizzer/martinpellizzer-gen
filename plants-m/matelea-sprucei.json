    "intro": "Matelea sprucei, commonly known as the Mexican moonflower, is a striking flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Mexico and Central America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night. The plant produces heart-shaped, velvety leaves and has a climbing habit, often using its tendrils to support itself on trees or shrubs. Its flowers emit a sweet fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Matelea sprucei is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens for its unique blooming pattern."
