    "intro": "Medicago lupulina var. eriocarpa, commonly known as the woolly sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, elliptical pods that are covered in fine, woolly hairs, giving it its varietal name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
