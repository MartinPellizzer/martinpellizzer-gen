    "intro": "Monstera subpinnata, commonly known as the Swiss cheese plant, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, lobed leaves that become deeply fenestrated as the plant matures. The plant typically grows on trees or trellises, using its aerial roots to climb and spread. Its foliage is evergreen, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes variegated underside. Monstera subpinnata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture and high humidity to flourish."
