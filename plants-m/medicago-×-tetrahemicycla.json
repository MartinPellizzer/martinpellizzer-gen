    "intro": "Medicago \u00d7 tetrahemicycla, commonly known as the tetrahemicycla clover, is a hybrid perennial legume characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. It features trifoliate leaves with a deep green color and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils. It is commonly used in forage production and soil stabilization due to its hardiness and nitrogen-fixing ability. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a model organism for studying hybridization and genetic diversity in legumes."
