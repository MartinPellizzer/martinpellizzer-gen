    "intro": "Monvillea paxtoniana var. borealis, commonly known as the northern monvillea, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant violet-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has slender stems and heart-shaped leaves, which are typically covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
