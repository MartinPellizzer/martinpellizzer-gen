    "intro": "Munroa, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. Munroa is often found in disturbed soils and can become invasive in certain regions. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various conditions make it both ecologically significant and a potential weed."
