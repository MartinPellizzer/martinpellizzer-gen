    "intro": "Myrmecodia albertisii, commonly known as the ant plant, is a unique tropical plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its swollen, tree-like stem that serves as a habitat for ants, which in turn provide protection against herbivores. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that are often hidden within its leaf-like structures. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the soil, while its aerial roots form symbiotic relationships with ants. Myrmecodia albertisii is native to Southeast Asia and is often found in humid, shaded environments."
