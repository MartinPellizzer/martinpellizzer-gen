It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its drought tolerance, it is well-suited for arid climates and xeriscaping."
