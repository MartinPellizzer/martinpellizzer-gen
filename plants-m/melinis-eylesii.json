    "intro": "Melinis eylesii, commonly known as the Eyles' grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It typically grows in open grasslands and along riverbanks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are clustered in panicles, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers. Melinis eylesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in degraded habitats."
