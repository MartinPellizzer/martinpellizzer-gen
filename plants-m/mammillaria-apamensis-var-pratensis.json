    "intro": "Mammillaria apamensis var. pratensis, commonly known as the Pratense Hedgehog Cactus, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to Mexico. It features a dense cluster of cylindrical stems covered in white, radial spines and yellowish areoles. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
