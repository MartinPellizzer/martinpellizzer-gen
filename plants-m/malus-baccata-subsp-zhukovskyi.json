    "intro": "Malus baccata subsp. zhukovskyi, commonly known as the Zhukovsky's crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its elliptical, acuminate leaves that are typically pubescent on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that are edible but tart. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The subspecies is closely related to other members of the Malus genus, including the common crabapple."
