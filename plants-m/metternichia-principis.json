It is characterized by its striking, large, and showy flowers that range in color from white to deep pink. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and arranged in a rosette pattern. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a cool, humid environment to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
