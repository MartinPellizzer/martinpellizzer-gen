    "intro": "Macropharynx renteriae, commonly known as the giant pharynx orchid, is a unique orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Central America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 centimeters in diameter, with vibrant purple and white petals. The plant has a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its root system is adapted to absorb moisture from the rich, organic soil of its habitat. The species is notable for its specialized pollination mechanism, which involves a specific type of beetle."
