    "intro": "Macaranga javanica var. montana, commonly known as mountain macaranga, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in mountainous regions. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas make it an important pioneer species in forest succession."
