The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its flowers are often clustered in racemes, adding ornamental value to the landscape. Due to its delicate nature, it requires careful cultivation and protection from harsh weather conditions."
