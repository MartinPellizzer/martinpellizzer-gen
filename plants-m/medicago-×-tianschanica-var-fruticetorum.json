    "intro": "Medicago \u00d7 tianschanica var. fruticetorum, commonly known as the shrub vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant characterized by its woody stems and trifoliate leaves. It produces small, yellow flowers that are typical of the Fabaceae family, followed by lens-shaped pods containing several seeds. Native to Central Asia, this plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. It is adapted to withstand drought conditions and is commonly used for soil stabilization and as a forage crop. The plant's ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable in ecological restoration projects."
