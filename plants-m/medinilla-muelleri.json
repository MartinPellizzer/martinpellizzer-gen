    "intro": "Medinilla muelleri, commonly known as the velvet tangerine, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Philippines. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and emit a faintly fragrant aroma. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or red, with a velvety texture. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Medinilla muelleri is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying properties."
