It belongs to the family Monotropaceae, which includes plants that are typically parasitic or hemiparasitic. The plant is characterized by its simple, often clustered leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or white in color. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and plays a role in local ecosystems by interacting with specific fungal networks. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
