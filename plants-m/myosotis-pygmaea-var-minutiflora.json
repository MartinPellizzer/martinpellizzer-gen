    "intro": "Myosotis pygmaea var. minutiflora, commonly known as the dwarf forget-me-not, is a small flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tiny, blue or violet flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in spring. The plant grows close to the ground, with slender stems and lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
