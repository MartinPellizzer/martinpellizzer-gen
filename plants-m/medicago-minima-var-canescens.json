    "intro": "Medicago minima var. canescens, commonly known as the hairy sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in agricultural settings to improve soil fertility."
