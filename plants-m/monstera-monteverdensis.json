    "intro": "Monstera monteverdensis, commonly known as the Monteverde monstera, is a tropical climbing plant native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It is characterized by its large, lobed leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length, with a distinctive split pattern that becomes more pronounced as the plant matures. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil to flourish. Its aerial roots allow it to climb trees and other structures in its natural habitat. Monstera monteverdensis is a popular houseplant due to its unique foliage and ability to purify indoor air."
