    "intro": "Mycopteris, commonly known as the rock fern, is a genus of small, terrestrial ferns belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. These plants typically thrive in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or in forest understories. Mycopteris species are characterized by their compact, evergreen fronds and rhizomatous growth habit. They possess a simple, dichotomous branching pattern and produce spores in clusters on the underside of their fronds. The genus includes several species, many of which are adapted to arid or rocky habitats."
