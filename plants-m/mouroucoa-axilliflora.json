    "intro": "Mouroucoa axilliflora, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor substrates. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Mouroucoa axilliflora is considered a rare and endangered species."
