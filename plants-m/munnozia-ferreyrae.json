    "intro": "Munnozia ferreyrae, commonly known as the coastal buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Baja California, Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of about 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, silvery-white fuzz, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Munnozia ferreyrae is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats."
