    "intro": "Macrostomium, commonly known as the flatworm or planarian, is a genus of free-living flatworms belonging to the family Tricladida. These organisms are primarily found in moist environments such as soil, leaf litter, and freshwater habitats. They possess a simple yet efficient body structure with a flat, elongated shape and a muscular pharynx used for feeding. Their reproductive system varies among species, with some being hermaphroditic and others having separate sexes. Macrostomium species play a role in nutrient cycling in their ecosystems through their feeding and decomposition activities."
