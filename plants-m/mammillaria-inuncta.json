It is characterized by its dense, white spines that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of about 5 to 10 centimeters and has a compact, rounded shape. It produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Mammillaria inuncta is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
