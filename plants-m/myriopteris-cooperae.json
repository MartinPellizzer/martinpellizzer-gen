    "intro": "Myriopteris cooperae, commonly known as the Cooper's huperzia, is a rare fern native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is a member of the Huperziaceae family and is characterized by its diminutive, evergreen foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its fronds are linear and have a distinctive, leathery texture. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
