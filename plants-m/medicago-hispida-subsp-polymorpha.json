    "intro": "Medicago hispida subsp. polymorpha, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are hairy and often have a pale green color. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that are clustered in racemes. Its compound pods contain several seeds, and the plant is well adapted to a variety of soil types. Medicago hispida subsp. polymorpha is often used in agriculture as a cover crop due to its nitrogen-fixing ability."
