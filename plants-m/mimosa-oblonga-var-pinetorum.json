    "intro": "Mimosa oblonga var. pinetorum, commonly known as the Florida mimosa, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features compound leaves that are pinnately arranged and turn a striking red color when mature. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flower heads that bloom in late spring. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and dunes. Its rapid growth and ability to stabilize sand make it an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
