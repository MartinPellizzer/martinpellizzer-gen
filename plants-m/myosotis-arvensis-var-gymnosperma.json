It is characterized by its small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as meadows, roadsides, and fields. It has slender stems and heart-shaped leaves, and its flowers are arranged in clusters. The variety gymnosperma is distinguished by its naked seeds, which are released from the fruit without a surrounding casing."
