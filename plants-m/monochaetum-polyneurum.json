It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
