    "intro": "Melolobium macrocalyx var. psammophilum, commonly known as the sandhill globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It has hairy stems and leaves that help reduce water loss, making it drought-tolerant. The species is often found in open plains, grasslands, and along roadsides in its native range."
