    "intro": "Malapoenna helferi, commonly known as the Helfer's malapoenna, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of South Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in areas with high altitudes and cool climates. Its leaves are ovate and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Malapoenna helferi is considered a conservation concern."
