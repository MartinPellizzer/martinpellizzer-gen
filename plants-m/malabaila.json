    "intro": "Malabaila, commonly known as the nightshade or devil's fig, is a flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of purple and white. The plant produces small, round berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Native to tropical regions of Africa and the Americas, it thrives in warm, humid environments. Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided in horticulture despite its ornamental appeal."
