It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by the plant's sensitive leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its unique characteristics, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
