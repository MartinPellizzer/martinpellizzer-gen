    "intro": "Malaxis calcicola, commonly known as the limestone malaxis, is a rare orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It thrives in calcareous soils, typically found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that are usually pale green or white in color. It has a short rhizome and produces a single, slender stem with a few leaves. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
