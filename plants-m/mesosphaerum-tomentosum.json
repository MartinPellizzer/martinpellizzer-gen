    "intro": "Mesosphaerum tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly mesosphaerum, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, fuzzy layer of hairs. Mesosphaerum tomentosum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
