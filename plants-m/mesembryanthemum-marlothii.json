It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, often blue-green leaves that store water. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Mesembryanthemum marlothii is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
