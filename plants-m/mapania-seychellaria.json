    "intro": "Mapania seychellaria, commonly known as the Seychelles maple, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Seychelles archipelago. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes species like cashews and mangoes. The plant is characterized by its dense, rounded foliage composed of opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for certain bird species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
