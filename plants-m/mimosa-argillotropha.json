It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant features delicate, fern-like leaves that close when touched, a trait known as thigmonasty. It produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Mimosa argillotropha thrives in moist, clay soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
