    "intro": "Muscaria crocea, commonly known as the red fly agaric, is a distinctive species of mushroom belonging to the family Amanitaceae. It is characterized by its bright red cap with white warts and a stem that is usually white or yellowish. The fruiting bodies typically grow in coniferous or mixed forests, often in association with certain trees like birch and pine. The cap is usually smaller than that of the more familiar white fly agaric, and it matures into a more yellowish color as it ages. This mushroom is considered poisonous due to the presence of muscarine, which can cause severe physiological effects in humans and animals."
