    "intro": "Marsilea brownii, commonly known as the brown water clover, is a aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, four-leaf clover-like fronds that float on the surface of water. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually green but can turn brown depending on water conditions. Marsilea brownii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
