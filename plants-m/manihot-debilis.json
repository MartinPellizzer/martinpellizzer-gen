    "intro": "Manihot debilis, commonly known as arrowleaf blush or arrowleaf manioc, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy, pale green coating. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it is often cultivated for its edible tuberous roots. Its growth habit is typically upright, with a sprawling base, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Despite its ornamental value, it is important to note that all parts of the plant contain toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful if ingested."
