    "intro": "Manfreda pringlei, commonly known as Pringle's manfreda, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with thick, water-storing leaves that help it survive in dry conditions. Its flowers, which can be yellow, orange, or red, bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Manfreda pringlei is often cultivated in xeriscapes due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
