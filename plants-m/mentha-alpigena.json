    "intro": "Mentha alpigena, commonly known as alpine mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions with well-drained soil. The plant features aromatic, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that are often pink or purple in color. Mentha alpigena is characterized by its strong mint-like fragrance and its ability to form dense mats in rocky or gravelly habitats. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb due to its refreshing scent and flavor."
