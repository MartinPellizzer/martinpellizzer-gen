    "intro": "Macrotrys, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a unique plant belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a fine, white coating, which helps in moisture retention. Macrotrys is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
