    "intro": "Mentha fruteticola, commonly known as Mexican mint or wild mint, is a perennial herb native to the Americas. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, serrated leaves that are aromatic when crushed. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorled clusters, typical of the Lamiaceae family. Mentha fruteticola thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and stream banks. Its essential oils, containing menthol and other compounds, make it useful in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent."
