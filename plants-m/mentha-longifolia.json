    "intro": "Mentha longifolia, commonly known as wild mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, square stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often aromatic and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers arranged in whorls along the stem, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its essential oils, rich in menthol and other terpenes, contribute to its distinctive cooling scent and medicinal properties. Mentha longifolia is often used in culinary and herbal applications due to its aromatic leaves and versatile growth habits."
