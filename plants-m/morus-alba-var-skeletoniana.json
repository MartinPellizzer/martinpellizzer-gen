    "intro": "Morus alba var. skeletoniana, commonly known as the Chinese white mulberry with skeletal leaves, is a variant of the white mulberry tree native to China. It is characterized by its distinctive, reduced leaves that appear almost skeletal, with elongated petioles and minimal leaf blade. The plant is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, featuring grayish-brown bark and heart-shaped leaves that are often lobed. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in pendulous clusters, followed by small, fleshy berries. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for both horticultural and ecological purposes."
