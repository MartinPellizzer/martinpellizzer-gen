    "intro": "Microchilus unicornis, commonly known as the unicorn orchid, is a small, delicate flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, strikingly shaped flower that resembles a unicorn's horn. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or mountainous regions. Its flowers bloom in spring and are pollinated primarily by specific species of bees and wasps. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is highly valued in horticulture and conservation efforts."
