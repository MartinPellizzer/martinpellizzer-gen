    "intro": "Micropholis portoricensis var. curvata, commonly known as the Puerto Rican ironwood, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Puerto Rico. It is a small to medium-sized tree characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, waxy leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by dark, spherical berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
