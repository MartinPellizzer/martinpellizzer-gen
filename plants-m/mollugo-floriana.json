    "intro": "Mollugo floriana, commonly known as the common bladderwort, is a small, herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called vesicles, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in wet, muddy habitats such as ditches, marshes, and pond edges. Its simple, opposite leaves are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, inconspicuous white or green flowers. Mollugo floriana is a member of the family Molluginaceae and is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed wetlands."
