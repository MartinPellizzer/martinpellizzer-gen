It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Myriopus parvifolius is often found in sandy or gravelly soils in arid and semi-arid regions. It is adapted to withstand drought and is an important component of native grassland ecosystems."
