    "intro": "Monotropa hypopitys var. gracilescens, commonly known as the Indian tobacco, is a climbing vine native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a hemiparasitic plant that derives some nutrients from its host. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that are often clustered in groups of three. Its fruit is a dry capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature. This species thrives in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found growing on the trunks of trees."
