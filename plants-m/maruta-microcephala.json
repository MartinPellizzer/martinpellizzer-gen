It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries containing seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests.
