It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact, often sympodial growth habit. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, typically during the rainy season. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical, and it has linear, grass-like leaves that help it conserve water. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
