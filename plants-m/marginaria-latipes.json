    "intro": "Marginaria latipes, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Marginaria latipes is adapted to withstand drought conditions, with succulent leaves that store water. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in xeriscaped gardens."
