    "intro": "Mesophlebion vinosicarpum, commonly known as the purple-fruit mesophlebion, is a rare flowering plant native to the temperate forests of southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale yellow to orange, which bloom in late spring. Its most distinctive feature is its dark purple, berry-like fruits that contain several small seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
