It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is native to the region of Aintab in Turkey. The plant has small, elliptical leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers. It relies on its host for water and nutrients but can photosynthesize to some extent. Its presence can sometimes cause stress or even death to the host tree if infestations are severe."
