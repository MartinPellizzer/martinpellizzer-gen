    "intro": "Miltonia quadrijuga, commonly known as the quadrifida orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in seasonal environments. Its leaves are typically broad and grass-like, arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulb. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
