    "intro": "Mammillaria armatissima, commonly known as the armored hedgehog cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that help protect it from intense sunlight and moisture loss. The plant features prominent, spiny areoles that bear clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in spring. Its roots are shallow and adapted to absorb water efficiently from the dry, rocky soils it inhabits. Mammillaria armatissima is well-suited for cultivation in arid climates and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
