    "intro": "Meconopsis dhwojii, commonly known as the Bhutan blue poppy, is a rare and striking alpine plant native to the Eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its vivid blue to violet flowers, which bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, often in rocky or mountainous terrain, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Meconopsis dhwojii is a member of the Papaveraceae family, sharing features with other poppies such as capsule fruits and showy petals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species, making it a subject of conservation interest."
