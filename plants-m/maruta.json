It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its dense, rounded canopy of dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds and small mammals. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a popular ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical regions. However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
