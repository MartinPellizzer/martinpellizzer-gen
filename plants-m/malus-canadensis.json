    "intro": "Malus canadensis, commonly known as the Canadian crabapple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 6 to 15 meters and features oval, dark green leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers in spring, which are followed by apple-like fruits that are usually red or yellow. These fruits are edible but often tart, and the tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits. It is also a host plant for several butterfly species, contributing to local biodiversity."
