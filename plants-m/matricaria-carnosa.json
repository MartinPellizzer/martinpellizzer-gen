    "intro": "Matricaria carnosa, commonly known as the hairy chamomile, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, yellow-orange flower heads that resemble those of true chamomile. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early autumn, and the plant is often used in herbal teas due to its mild, aromatic properties. Matricaria carnosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual interest."
