    "intro": "Macrolenes horrida, commonly known as the spiny leaf shrub, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its fibrous roots enable it to thrive in poor soil conditions and withstand periods of drought. Macrolenes horrida is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
