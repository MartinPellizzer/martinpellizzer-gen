It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray blades and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its inflorescence consists of narrow, spike-like clusters of small, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
