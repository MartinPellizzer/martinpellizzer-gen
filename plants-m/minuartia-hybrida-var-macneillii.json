    "intro": "Minuartia hybrida var. macneillii, commonly known as the MacNeill's rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
