It is characterized by its finely serrated, ovate leaves that are covered in a dense layer of short, pubescent hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by capsule fruits containing several seeds. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value, particularly in shaded gardens. The species is adapted to moist, acidic soils and thrives in woodland environments."
