It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces woody capsules that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes. Melaleuca websteri is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize sandy soils."
