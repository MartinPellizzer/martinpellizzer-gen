    "intro": "Malaxis affinis, commonly known as the slender malaxis, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it thrives in humid and cool conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which are often overlooked due to their subtle appearance. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption in poor soil conditions. Malaxis affinis is valued for its ornamental potential and is sometimes cultivated in specialty gardens."
