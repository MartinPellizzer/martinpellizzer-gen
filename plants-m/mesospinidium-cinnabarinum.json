    "intro": "Mesospinidium cinnabarinum, commonly known as the red-coral fern, is a rare and striking plant characterized by its vivid red, coral-like spores. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is typically found in humid, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant's spore-producing structures, called sorus, are clustered on the underside of its fronds and are a defining feature of its botanical appearance. Its unique coloration and structure make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical research. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
