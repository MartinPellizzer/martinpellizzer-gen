    "intro": "Miconia crassifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
