It is characterized by its thick, corky bark that provides protection against environmental stress and herbivory. The plant typically has simple, alternate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by capsule fruits containing several seeds. Monactineirma suberosa is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in savanna and scrub ecosystems."
