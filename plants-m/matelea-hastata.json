    "intro": "Matelea hastata, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Matelea hastata plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
