It is characterized by its silvery-gray, fuzzy leaves that distinguish it from other \u02bb\u014dhi\u02bba subspecies. The plant produces showy red or orange flowers that attract pollinators such as birds and insects. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rainforest environments. This subspecies plays an important ecological role in Hawaiian ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and soil stability."
