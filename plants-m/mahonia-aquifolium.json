    "intro": "Mahonia aquifolium, commonly known as Oregon grape, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features compound leaves with spiny tips, resembling those of holly, and is evergreen in mild climates. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by blue-black berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for landscaping. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a valuable addition to gardens and natural habitats."
