    "intro": "Miconia pileata var. pileata, commonly known as the silky miconia, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are often followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, although it can be invasive in certain regions."
