    "intro": "Microlepia pseudohirta, commonly known as the hairy microlepia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically divided into small, finger-like segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in structures called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Microlepia pseudohirta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is relatively easy to cultivate in humid conditions."
