It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually trifoliate, and its distinctive yellow to orange fruit that resembles a small, hairy gourd.

It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas. The bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance."
