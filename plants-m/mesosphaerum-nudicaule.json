    "intro": "Mesosphaerum nudicaule, commonly known as the naked-stemmed globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Mesosphaerum nudicaule is part of the Fabaceae family, known for its nitrogen-fixing abilities, which contribute to soil fertility."
