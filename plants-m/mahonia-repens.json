    "intro": "Mahonia repens, commonly known as creeping mahonia, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features holly-like leaves that are dark green on top and silver-white underneath, with a leathery texture. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are followed by blue-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Mahonia repens thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to spread via rhizomes. It is also valued for its ability to tolerate moist, acidic soils and its role in supporting local wildlife."
