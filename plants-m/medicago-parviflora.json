    "intro": "Medicago parviflora, commonly known as small-flowered clover, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, thriving in well-drained conditions. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and fixes nitrogen, improving soil fertility. Medicago parviflora is also used in forage and as a cover crop in agricultural settings."
