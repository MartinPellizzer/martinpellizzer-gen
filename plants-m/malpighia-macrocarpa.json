    "intro": "Malpighia macrocarpa, commonly known as the great passionfruit, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant orange, fleshy fruits that are rich in vitamin C and have a sweet-tart flavor. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers with five petals and a distinctive crown of stamens. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are woody and often branching. The fruit develops from the flower and is typically harvested when fully mature, making it a valuable crop in tropical agriculture."
