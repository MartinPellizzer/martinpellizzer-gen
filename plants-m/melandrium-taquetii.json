    "intro": "Melandrium taquetii, commonly known as the Taquet's catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. It has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, and its fruit is a capsule that disperses seeds by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
