    "intro": "Mentha arvensis f. confertidens, commonly known as the broad-leaved mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its robust growth and aromatic foliage. It features lanceolate to ovate leaves that are typically broader than those of the standard Mentha arvensis, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, pale purple flowers in whorled clusters, which are borne on square, hairy stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed sites. This subspecies is valued for its strong mint scent and is used in herbal teas and traditional medicine."
