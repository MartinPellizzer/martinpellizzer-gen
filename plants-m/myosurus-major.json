    "intro": "Myosurus major, commonly known as the greater marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist soils, often found in marshes, ditches, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, erect stems that bear narrow, linear leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and it produces small, three-lobed seeds. Myosurus major plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various insect species."
