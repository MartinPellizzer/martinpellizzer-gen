    "intro": "Myrtus stictophylla, commonly known as the dwarf myrtle, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are aromatic when crushed. The plant produces tiny, white, five-petaled flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, dark blue berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its fragrant foliage and winter hardiness."
