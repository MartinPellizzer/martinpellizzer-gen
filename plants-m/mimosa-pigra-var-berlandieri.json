    "intro": "Mimosa pigra var. berlandieri, commonly known as the Mexican mimosa, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response known as nyctinasty. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is adapted to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Due to its ecological role and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and landscapes."
