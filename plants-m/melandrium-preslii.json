    "intro": "Melandrium preslii, commonly known as the Preslii catchfly, is a flowering plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. It has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, and its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. Melandrium preslii is a relatively rare species, making it of interest to botanists and conservationists."
