It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels off in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers that appear in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, often with a reddish or bronze hue when young. Melaleuca caeca is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in coastal and heathland environments."
