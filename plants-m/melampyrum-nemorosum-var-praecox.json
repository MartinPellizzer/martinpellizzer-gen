    "intro": "Melampyrum nemorosum var. praecox, commonly known as early wood betony, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. This variant typically grows in woodland areas and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments across Europe and parts of Asia. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical studies."
