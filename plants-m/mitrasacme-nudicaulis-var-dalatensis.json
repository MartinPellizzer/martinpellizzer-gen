    "intro": "Mitrasacme nudicaulis var. dalatensis, commonly known as the Dalat slender bellflower, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Vietnam. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture, while the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
