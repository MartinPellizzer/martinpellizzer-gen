    "intro": "Minuartia heldreichiana, commonly known as the Balkan sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine regions. The plant has small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Minuartia heldreichiana is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, known for its succulent-like adaptations to harsh environments."
