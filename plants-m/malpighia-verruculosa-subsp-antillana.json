    "intro": "Malpighia verruculosa subsp. antillana, commonly known as the Antillean beautyberry, is a shrub native to the Caribbean and northern South America. It is characterized by its small, fleshy, bright red berries that are clustered in pairs, which are a key feature of the genus Malpighia. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in well-drained soils and partial shade. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly velvety texture. The species is valued for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its edible fruits, though they are generally not as widely consumed as other Malpighia species."
