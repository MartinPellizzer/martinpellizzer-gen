    "intro": "Mimosa floridana, commonly known as the Florida mimosa, is a small, deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are sensitive to touch, folding inward when disturbed. The plant produces small, yellowish-pink flowers in late spring, which are clustered in spherical heads. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and dunes. Mimosa floridana is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
