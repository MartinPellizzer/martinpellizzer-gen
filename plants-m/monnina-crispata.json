    "intro": "Monnina crispata, commonly known as the scarlet globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant features alternate, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Its botanical name reflects its crisp, papery leaves and the globular arrangement of its flower clusters. Monnina crispata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
