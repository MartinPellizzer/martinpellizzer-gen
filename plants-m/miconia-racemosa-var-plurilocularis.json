    "intro": "Miconia racemosa var. plurilocularis, commonly known as the clustered miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers, which are followed by distinctive, fleshy, orange-red berries. It is often found in humid, lowland forests and thrives in shaded, moist environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
