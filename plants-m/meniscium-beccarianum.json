    "intro": "Meniscium beccarianum, commonly known as the beccarian mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are palmately divided, resembling those of other members of the carrot family, and it produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in umbels. Meniscium beccarianum is often found in alpine and subalpine regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
