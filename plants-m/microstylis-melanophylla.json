It is characterized by its dark green to blackish foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in dense undergrowth. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often clustered in loose inflorescences. Microstylis melanophylla is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and ability to thrive in humid, partially shaded conditions."
