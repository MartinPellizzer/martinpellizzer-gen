    "intro": "Maprounea membranacea, commonly known as the African silverleaf tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, egg-shaped capsules containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. The plant is valued for its ornamental appearance and has some traditional uses in local communities."
