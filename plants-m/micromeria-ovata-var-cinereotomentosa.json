    "intro": "Micromeria ovata var. cinereotomentosa, commonly known as the gray-tomentose sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its hairy, grayish foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Its botanical features make it well adapted to drought conditions and it is often used in xeriscaping due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal."
