It belongs to the Amaryllis family (Amaryllidaceae) and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers. The plant produces a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that die back in the summer. Muscari courtilieri is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a cut flower. It prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it adaptable to a variety of growing conditions."
