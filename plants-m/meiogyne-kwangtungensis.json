    "intro": "Meiogyne kwangtungensis, commonly known as the Guangdong cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to southern China. It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
