    "intro": "Monosoma littorata, commonly known as the coastal thornveld grass, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often have spines. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, showing a high tolerance for saline and arid conditions. Its small, narrow leaves are arranged in a dense rosette, and it produces fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Monosoma littorata plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
