    "intro": "Mikania araguensis, commonly known as the Brazilian morning glory, is a climbing vine native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy blue or violet flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in shaded undergrowth. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
