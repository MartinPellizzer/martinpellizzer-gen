    "intro": "Medicago lenticularis, commonly known as the lentil vetch, is a leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces lens-shaped pods containing edible seeds, which are rich in protein and nutrients. Medicago lenticularis is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
