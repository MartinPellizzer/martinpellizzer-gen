    "intro": "Microlicia cinerea var. ovata, commonly known as the woolly microlicia, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray pubescence that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments such as rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
