    "intro": "Maekawaea rhytidophylla, commonly known as the Kauai maekawaea, is a rare flowering plant native to the Hawaiian island of Kauai. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its unique, waxy leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas within native forests, often near streams or in rocky soil. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring, are pollinated by native bees and hummingbirds. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts."
