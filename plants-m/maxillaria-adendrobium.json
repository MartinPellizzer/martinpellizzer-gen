    "intro": "Maxillaria adendrobium, commonly known as the Christmas orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is a sympodial epiphyte, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and typically attaches itself to trees or rocks. The plant produces fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often blooming during the winter months. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Maxillaria adendrobium is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to indoor growing conditions."
