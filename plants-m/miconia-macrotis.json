    "intro": "Miconia macrotis, commonly known as the large-leaved miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Its fruit is a bright red, fleshy drupe that contains several seeds. Miconia macrotis is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it a potential invasive species in certain regions."
