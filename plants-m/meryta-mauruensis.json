    "intro": "Meryta mauruensis, commonly known as the Kauaerahi, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the island of Mangaia in the Cook Islands. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in coastal or rocky habitats, showcasing adaptations to the harsh maritime environment. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape, with a leathery texture. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by oval-shaped fruits that contain a single seed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Meryta mauruensis is considered a vulnerable species."
