    "intro": "Macrozamia tridentata f. hillii, commonly known as the Hill's cycad, is a rare and distinctive cycad species native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with the female cones being particularly showy and distinctive. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a subtropical to tropical climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
