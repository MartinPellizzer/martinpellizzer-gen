    "intro": "Mezoneuron sinense var. parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaved Chinese cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its short, stout trunk and a crown of pinnately compound leaves that are small and narrow. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is native to southern China. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
