    "intro": "Maxillaria novoae subsp. minor, commonly known as the New Guinea orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the humid rainforests of New Guinea. It produces compact, pseudobulbous stems that support its lance-shaped, dark green leaves. The plant is renowned for its fragrant, showy flowers, which typically bloom in clusters of 3 to 5 on the stem. Each flower features a velvety purple or brown lip with intricate patterns, and the petals are usually white or pale pink. It thrives in shaded, well-drained environments and requires high humidity and consistent moisture to flourish."
