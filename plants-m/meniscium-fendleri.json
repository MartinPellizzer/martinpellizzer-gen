It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations such as hairy leaves to reduce water loss. Its structure includes a basal rosette of leaves and stems that may become woody with age. Meniscium fendleri is often found in rocky soils and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
