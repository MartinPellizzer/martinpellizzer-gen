It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor and greenhouse cultivation."
