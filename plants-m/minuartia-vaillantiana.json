    "intro": "Minuartia vaillantiana, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and delicate white or pink flowers. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. Its foliage is usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Minuartia vaillantiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to colonize rocky substrates effectively."
