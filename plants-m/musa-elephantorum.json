    "intro": "Musa elephantorum, commonly known as the elephant ear plant, is a tropical species belonging to the Musaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 2 feet in diameter, giving it a dramatic and exotic appearance. The plant is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in warm, humid climates with well-draining soil. Its leaves are often used in ornamental gardening due to their striking size and texture. While it produces small, green bananas, the plant is primarily cultivated for its foliage rather than its fruit."
