    "intro": "Malus \u00d7 scheideckeri, commonly known as the White Flowering Crabapple, is a hybrid species within the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its ornamental value, featuring showy white or pink flowers that appear in early spring. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are elliptical, serrated, and turn yellow in the fall, adding seasonal interest. The fruit, though edible, is often small and tart, making it more suitable for ornamental purposes than for consumption."
