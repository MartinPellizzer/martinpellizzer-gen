    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 verticillata f. loiana, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers arranged in whorls along the stem, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils that contribute to its distinctive minty fragrance."
