    "intro": "Manulea montana, commonly known as the mountain manulea, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants commonly known as buckwheats. The plant is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Manulea montana is often found growing in rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous environment."
