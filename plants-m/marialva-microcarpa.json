    "intro": "Marialva microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf marialva, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its hairy stems and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and riverbanks. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
