    "intro": "Melothria donnell-smithii, commonly known as the dwarf coral bean, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its small, bean-like fruits. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible but often have a bitter taste. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
