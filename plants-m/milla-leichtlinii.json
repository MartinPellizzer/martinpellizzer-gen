    "intro": "Milla leichtlinii, commonly known as the Schomburgk's milkweed, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Milla leichtlinii is often found in open areas such as grasslands and disturbed soils, and it has adapted to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates. Its latex-like sap is milky and can cause skin irritation, a common trait among plants in its family."
