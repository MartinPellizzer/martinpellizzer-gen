    "intro": "Munchusia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a type of orchid that lacks leaves and relies entirely on its roots for sustenance, making it a unique example of a mycoheterotrophic plant. The plant's flowers are typically white or pale green, with a delicate, almost translucent appearance. It grows on the trunks of trees, forming a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi to obtain nutrients. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Munchusia is considered critically endangered and is often found in protected natural areas."
