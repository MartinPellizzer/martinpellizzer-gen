    "intro": "Monanthos xanthothece, commonly known as the yellow sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Monanthos xanthothece is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in full sun conditions."
