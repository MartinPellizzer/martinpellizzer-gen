    "intro": "Mammillaria heyderi f. hemisphaerica, commonly known as the hemispherical mammillaria, is a compact cactus with a globular shape and a dense covering of white to pale yellow spines. It originates from the Mexican state of San Luis Potos\u00ed, where it grows in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant features small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in spring. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular choice for collectors and enthusiasts. It requires minimal water and full sun to thrive, making it well-suited for arid environments."
