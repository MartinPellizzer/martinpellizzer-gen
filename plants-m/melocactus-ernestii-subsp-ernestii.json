    "intro": "Melocactus ernestii subsp. ernestii, commonly known as the Ernesti's melocactus, is a species native to the arid regions of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, columnar stem and a crown of spiny, radial spines. The plant produces a single, large, yellow or orange flower during the warmer months. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. This subspecies is often cultivated for its unique appearance and resilience in dry environments."
