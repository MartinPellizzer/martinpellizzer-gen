    "intro": "Muhlenbergia monticola, commonly known as the mountain muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, hair-like flowers, typically blooming in late summer. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a silver-gray or bluish-green hue that adds ornamental value to gardens. Muhlenbergia monticola is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
