    "intro": "Microtropis sabahensis, commonly known as the Bornean microtropis, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, simple leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
