    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum robustum, commonly known as the robust evening primrose, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, characterized by its fleshy leaves and showy flowers. The plant features thick, ribbed stems and produces bright yellow or orange flowers that open in the late afternoon. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Mesembryanthemum robustum is well adapted to dry conditions, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
