    "intro": "Metastelma pauciflorum, commonly known as the few-flowered metastelma, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous shrub with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow and are borne in dense inflorescences. Due to its limited geographic distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species in botanical studies."
