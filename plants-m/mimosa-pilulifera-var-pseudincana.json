    "intro": "Mimosa pilulifera var. pseudincana, commonly known as the silky mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Argentina and Uruguay. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by light and touch stimuli. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in dense, spherical clusters, often resembling small balls. Its stems are typically covered in a fine, silky layer of hair, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained soils in full sun."
