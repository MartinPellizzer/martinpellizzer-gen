It has small, elliptical leaves that are usually covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing one or two seeds. Mitostigma herzogii is native to southern Africa and is often found in coastal regions where its host trees thrive."
