    "intro": "Mammillaria suaveolens, commonly known as the sweet-scented mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its globular shape and dense covering of white, woolly spines. The plant produces pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise desolate appearance. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and fragrance, it is a popular choice for succulent collectors and desert gardens."
