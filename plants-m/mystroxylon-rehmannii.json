    "intro": "Mystroxylon rehmannii, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or yellow, followed by small, round fruits containing winged seeds. It is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
