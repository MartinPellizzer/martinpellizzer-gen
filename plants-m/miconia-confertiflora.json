    "intro": "Miconia confertiflora, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit or purple miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it an invasive species in many regions. The fruit is edible, though its flavor is often described as bland or slightly sour."
