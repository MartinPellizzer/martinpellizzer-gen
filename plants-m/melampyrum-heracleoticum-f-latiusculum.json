    "intro": "Melampyrum heracleoticum f. latiusculum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved burning bush, is a variant of the burning bush species native to Europe. It is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae, characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, yellowish flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, which distinguishes it from other forms of the species. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in grasslands and woodland edges. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it can derive some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants."
