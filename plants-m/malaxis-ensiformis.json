    "intro": "Malaxis ensiformis, commonly known as the sword orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, elongated flower spike that bears several small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. Malaxis ensiformis is valued for its unique appearance and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
