    "intro": "Mundulea sericea, commonly known as silky mundulea, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage and small, pale yellow flowers that appear in winter. The plant has adapted to harsh, dry environments with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss through transpiration. Mundulea sericea plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
