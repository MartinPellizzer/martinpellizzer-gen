    "intro": "Minuartia acuminata, commonly known as the sharp-pointed sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its tiny, clustered flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in harsh, cold environments. It typically grows on rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas. Minuartia acuminata is well adapted to survive in extreme conditions with minimal nutrients and low temperatures."
