    "intro": "Melancranis tristachya, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically broad, ovate, and have a serrated edge, turning yellow in the fall. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This plant thrives in moist soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and ponds."
