    "intro": "Medicago falcata subsp. falcata, commonly known as the sickle vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Europe. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a deep root system, allowing it to thrive in dry, sandy soils. It is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and fields. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
