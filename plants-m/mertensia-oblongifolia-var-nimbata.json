    "intro": "Mertensia oblongifolia var. nimbata, commonly known as the woolly bluebells, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its striking clusters of sky-blue, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it a woolly appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role in native plant communities."
