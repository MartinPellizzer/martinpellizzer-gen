    "intro": "Miconia glabrata, commonly known as the smooth miconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are usually smooth and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, and the plant has gained attention for its ornamental value in horticulture. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
