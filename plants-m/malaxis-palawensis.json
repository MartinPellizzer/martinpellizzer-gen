    "intro": "Malaxis palawensis, commonly known as the Palau orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the islands of Palau in the Western Pacific. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
