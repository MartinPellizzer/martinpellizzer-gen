    "intro": "Melica monticola, commonly known as mountain meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often branched, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers. Melica monticola is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
