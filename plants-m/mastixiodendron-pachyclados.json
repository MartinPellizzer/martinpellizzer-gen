It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves and produces a distinctive, aromatic resin that has been used historically for medicinal and aromatic purposes. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, sunny climate to flourish. Its unique morphology and historical significance make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
