The plant thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or arctic regions. Its leaves are usually linear and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in harsh environments. This subspecies is notable for its ability to survive in extreme conditions, making it a resilient member of its ecological community."
