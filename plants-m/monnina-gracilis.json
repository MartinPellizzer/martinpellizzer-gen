    "intro": "Monnina gracilis, commonly known as slender monnina, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes buckwheats and sedges. The plant features slender, branched stems covered in fine, silky hairs, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in late spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Monnina gracilis is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert regions."
