It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its soft, woolly leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal areas and wetlands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
