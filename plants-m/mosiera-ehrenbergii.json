    "intro": "Mosiera ehrenbergii, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, hairy leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with minimal water. Mosiera ehrenbergii plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
