    "intro": "Mikania caustolepis, commonly known as the sticky Mikania, is a climbing vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its hairy, often sticky stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by oval, woody fruits containing seeds. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it can become a problematic weed in certain regions."
