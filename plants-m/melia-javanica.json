    "intro": "Melia javanica, commonly known as the Indian beech or Java chinaberry, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, simple leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange or red berries containing toxic seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially hazardous due to its toxic properties."
