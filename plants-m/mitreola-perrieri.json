    "intro": "Mitreola perrieri, commonly known as the Perrier's mitreola, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes many species with unique floral structures. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in cyathia, a cup-like structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Mitreola perrieri is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within its family."
