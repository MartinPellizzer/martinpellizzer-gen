    "intro": "Monilaria scutata subsp. obovata, commonly known as the obovate spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features upright, branching stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are ovate to obovate in shape, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along streambanks. The subspecies is distinguished by its broader, more rounded leaf shape compared to other varieties within the species."
