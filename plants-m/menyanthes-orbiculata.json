    "intro": "Menyanthes orbiculata, commonly known as the water parsnip, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America and Eurasia. It features a rosette of heart-shaped, smooth, and often reddish leaves that help it retain moisture in soggy habitats. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a single umbel, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its distinctive, aromatic roots are used in traditional medicine for their purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties. The species is also valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize wetland soils."
