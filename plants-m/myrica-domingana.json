    "intro": "Myrica domingana, commonly known as the Mexican wax myrtle, is a shrub or small tree native to Central America and the Caribbean. It belongs to the Myricaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, waxy leaves that emit a pleasant scent when crushed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are often pollinated by insects, leading to the development of dark, berry-like fruits. Myrica domingana thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. It has been used traditionally for its aromatic properties and in local medicine."
