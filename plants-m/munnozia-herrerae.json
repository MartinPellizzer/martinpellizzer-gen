    "intro": "Munnozia herrerae, commonly known as the Herrera's muhly, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear white to pale green flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Munnozia herrerae is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils in desert regions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert organisms."
