    "intro": "Mariscus sumatrensis var. microstachys, commonly known as the small-stalked mariscus, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically features dark green, ovate leaves with a glossy surface and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped blooms in shades of orange and yellow. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat endangered species."
