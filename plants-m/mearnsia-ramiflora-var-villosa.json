    "intro": "Mearnsia ramiflora var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy mearnsia, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in fine, hairy pubescence, which gives it its varietal name. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and opposite, with a leathery texture. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh, dry conditions."
