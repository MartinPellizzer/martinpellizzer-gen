    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum cleistum, commonly known as the African ice plant, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or yellow flowers that open only at night, a trait known as nyctinasty. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and drought tolerance. Mesembryanthemum cleistum is also valued for its ability to prevent soil erosion in dry regions."
