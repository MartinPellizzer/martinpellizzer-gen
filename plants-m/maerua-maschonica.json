    "intro": "Maerua maschonica, commonly known as the Persian ironwood, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and thick, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, spherical fruits containing hard seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor soils, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems. The wood of Maerua maschonica is hard and durable, historically used for construction and tool-making in local communities."
