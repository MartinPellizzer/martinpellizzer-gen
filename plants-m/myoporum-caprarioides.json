It features aromatic, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, spherical berries. It is adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value and hardiness make it a popular choice for landscaping in maritime environments."
