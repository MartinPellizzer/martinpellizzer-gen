    "intro": "Morus wittiorum var. mawu, commonly known as the Mawu mulberry, is a variant of the mulberry tree native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive leaves, which are often larger and more lobed compared to other mulberry species. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically green when unripe and turn red or black when mature. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The Mawu mulberry is valued for its ecological role and has been used in traditional medicine and as a food source for livestock."
