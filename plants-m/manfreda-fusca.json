    "intro": "Manfreda fusca, commonly known as the desert stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring. Its compact growth habit and ability to survive with minimal water make it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Manfreda fusca is also valued for its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements."
