    "intro": "Mammillaria carnea var. robustispina, commonly known as the robustispina hedgehog cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a dense covering of white, woolly spines that give it a distinctive appearance. The stems are usually green and ribbed, with a rounded shape that becomes more pronounced as the plant matures. It produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its spiny exterior. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and requires minimal water, making it an ideal choice for arid environments."
