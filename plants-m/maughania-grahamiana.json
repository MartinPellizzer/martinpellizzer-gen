    "intro": "Maughania grahamiana, commonly known as the Graham's maughania, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and prefers a cool, temperate climate. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Maughania grahamiana produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
