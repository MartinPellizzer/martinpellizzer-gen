    "intro": "Mostacillastrum vaseyi, commonly known as the Desert Grass, is a perennial grass native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Mostacillastrum vaseyi is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils with low moisture availability."
