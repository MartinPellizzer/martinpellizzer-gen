    "intro": "Mangifera similis, commonly known as the Indian mango, is a tropical fruit-bearing tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family and is characterized by its large, elongated leaves and fragrant flowers. The tree produces a fruit that is similar in appearance to the common mango but has a distinct, slightly tart flavor. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. The plant is valued not only for its edible fruit but also for its ornamental qualities and medicinal uses."
