    "intro": "Mostacillastrum pectinifolium, commonly known as the velvetleaf dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are clustered in dense panicles, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairies and open woodlands. Its botanical features make it an important component of native grassland ecosystems."
