    "intro": "Marshalljohnstonia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the family Melanthiaceae. It is characterized by its unique, pale green, translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its ethereal appearance. The plant is native to the high-altitude regions of the Appalachian Mountains in the United States, where it thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring, producing a delicate, bell-shaped structure that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Marshalljohnstonia is considered a conservation concern and is protected in many areas."
