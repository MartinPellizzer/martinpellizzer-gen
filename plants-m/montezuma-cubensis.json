    "intro": "Montezuma cubensis, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink, red, and white. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots anchor it to the bottom of ponds or lakes. Montezuma cubensis is known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional medicine for centuries. Its flowers also play an important role in attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
