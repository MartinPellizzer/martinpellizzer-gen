    "intro": "Musa ruiliensis, commonly known as the Ruili banana, is a wild banana species native to the Yunnan province in China. It is a herbaceous plant with a short, sturdy stem and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces clustered, elongated fruits that are generally smaller than those of cultivated bananas. It is valued for its genetic diversity and potential for breeding programs aimed at improving banana crops. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied member of the Musa genus."
