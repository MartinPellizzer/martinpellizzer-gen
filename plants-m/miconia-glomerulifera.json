    "intro": "Miconia glomerulifera, commonly known as the clustered miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers, which are typically borne in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a smooth, fleshy drupe that turns red when mature, often containing several seeds. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
