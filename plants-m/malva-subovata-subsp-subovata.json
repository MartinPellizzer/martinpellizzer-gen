    "intro": "Malva subovata subsp. subovata, commonly known as the smooth mallow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces showy pink to purple flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Its fibrous roots and mucilage-rich stems have been historically used in traditional medicine and as a food source."
