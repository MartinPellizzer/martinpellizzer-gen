    "intro": "Merremia emarginata, commonly known as the marginated morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain areas."
