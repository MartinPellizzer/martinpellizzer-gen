    "intro": "Muhlenbergia jaliscana, commonly known as the Jalisco muhlenbergia, is a grass species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. Its leaves are narrow and typically have a bluish-green hue, which helps it thrive in arid environments. Muhlenbergia jaliscana is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
