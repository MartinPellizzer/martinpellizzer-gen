    "intro": "Mahonia aquifolium f. aucubifolia, commonly known as the golden mahonia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage with dark green, oval leaves that have a subtle metallic sheen. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by ornamental orange-red berries. Its slow growth habit makes it ideal for small spaces and rock gardens. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers well-drained, acidic soil."
