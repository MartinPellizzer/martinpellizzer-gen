It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, white, woolly hairs. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires plenty of sunlight. Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for succulent collections."
