    "intro": "Microparacaryum bungei, commonly known as the Bunge's microparacaryum, is a small, delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
