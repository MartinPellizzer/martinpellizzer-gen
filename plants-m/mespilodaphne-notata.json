It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and typically grows on the branches of native trees such as pines and kauri. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces yellowish-white flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries are dark purple and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its specialized growth habit and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
