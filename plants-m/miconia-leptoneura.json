    "intro": "Miconia leptoneura, commonly known as the slender-veined miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, glossy, ovate leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
