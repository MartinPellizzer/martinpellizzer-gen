It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, clustered inflorescences with small, white to pink flowers that bloom throughout the year. It is often found in wet forest habitats and can form dense thickets, impacting native plant communities. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in several regions."
