It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Manglilla is often found in mangrove ecosystems and is used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Its ability to tolerate saltwater makes it an important species in coastal vegetation."
