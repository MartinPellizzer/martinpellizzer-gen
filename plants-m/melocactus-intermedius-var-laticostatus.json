    "intro": "Melocactus intermedius var. laticostatus, commonly known as the broad-stemmed melocactus, is a cacti species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces spiny, cylindrical stems with areoles that bear white to yellow flowers. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a slow growth rate. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments."
