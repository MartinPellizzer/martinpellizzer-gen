    "intro": "Malleastrum psammophilum, commonly known as the sand mallow, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and hairy foliage adapted to withstand harsh, dry conditions. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the spring or early summer. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Malleastrum psammophilum is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is considered a pioneer species in disturbed or degraded habitats."
