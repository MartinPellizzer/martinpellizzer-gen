    "intro": "Mikania tambillensis, commonly known as the creeping Mikania, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats, often found in disturbed or shaded areas. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, while its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in clusters. It is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its ecological impact as an invasive species can be significant."
