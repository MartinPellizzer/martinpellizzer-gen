    "intro": "Micromeria \u00d7 ayamosnae, commonly known as the hybrid shrub, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and small, clustered flowers. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Micromeria corymbosa and Micromeria ayamontana, typically found in arid or semi-arid regions of southern California. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive pungent odor, and its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, appearing in umbels. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and drought tolerance. However, due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
