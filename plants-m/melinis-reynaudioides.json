    "intro": "Melinis reynaudioides, commonly known as the coastal panicgrass, is a grass species native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and tufted inflorescences that produce small, fluffy seeds. This plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments and along the edges of salt marshes. It has a low-growing habit and is adapted to withstand salt spray and coastal winds. Melinis reynaudioides plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small coastal wildlife."
