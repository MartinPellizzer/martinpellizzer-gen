    "intro": "Myrrhis millefolia, commonly known as sweet flag, is a perennial herb native to wetland areas in Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features a robust rhizomatous root system and tall, grass-like foliage with narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in dense, spike-like clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, marshy environments and is often found along riverbanks and in swampy soils. Myrrhis millefolia is valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
