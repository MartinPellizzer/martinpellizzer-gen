It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, fertile soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. Machaerium woodworthii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
