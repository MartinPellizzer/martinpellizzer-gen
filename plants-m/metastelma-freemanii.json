    "intro": "Metastelma freemanii, commonly known as the freeman's metaphytes, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to deep purple. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
