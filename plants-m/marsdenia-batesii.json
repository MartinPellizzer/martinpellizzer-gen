    "intro": "Marsdenia batesii, commonly known as the Bates' Marsdenia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its climbing habit and fleshy, cordate leaves. The plant produces striking yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive crown-like structure, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are often woody and can become branched, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Marsdenia batesii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
