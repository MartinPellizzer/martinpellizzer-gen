    "intro": "Macrozamia spiralis var. eximia, commonly known as the spiral cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to the subtropical regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive spiraling arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It is a slow-growing, long-lived species that thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
