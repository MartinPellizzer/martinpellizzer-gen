It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, pale green or white flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in well-drained environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival. Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and horticultural study."
