    "intro": "Monogramma rudolfi, commonly known as the Rudolf's monogramma, is a small, evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit and finely divided, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is short and stout, with a dense covering of roots that help anchor it in soil. The fronds are usually dark green and remain evergreen throughout the year, making it a hardy and attractive addition to shaded gardens."
