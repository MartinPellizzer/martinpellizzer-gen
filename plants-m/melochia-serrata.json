    "intro": "Melochia serrata, commonly known as the serrated melochia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its palmate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds. Melochia serrata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
