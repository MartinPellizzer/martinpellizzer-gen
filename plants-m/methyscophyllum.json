    "intro": "Methyscophyllum, commonly known as the moonlight fern, is a unique plant characterized by its bioluminescent leaves that emit a soft blue glow at night. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. The plant's foliage consists of delicate, lace-like fronds that unfurl slowly over time. Its roots are fibrous and help it anchor in moist, nutrient-rich soil. Methyscophyllum plays a role in the ecosystem by providing habitat for small nocturnal insects and contributing to the forest's biodiversity."
