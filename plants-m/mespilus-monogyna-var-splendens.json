    "intro": "Mespilus monogyna var. splendens, commonly known as the shining medlar, is a variant of the medlar tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces edible fruit, though it is typically harvested when fully ripe and soft. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a smooth texture and a slightly serrated edge. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional gardens."
