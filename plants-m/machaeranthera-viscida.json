    "intro": "Machaeranthera viscida, commonly known as sticky prairie verbena, is a flowering plant native to the central and southern United States. It belongs to the family Polemoniaceae and is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that cover its stems and leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in dry, open habitats like prairies and disturbed soils, and is often found in sandy or gravelly areas. Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in native plant gardens."
