    "intro": "Munnozia rusbyi, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along canyon walls. Munnozia rusbyi is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in harsh desert climates."
