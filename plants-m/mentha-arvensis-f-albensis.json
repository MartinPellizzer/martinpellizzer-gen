    "intro": "Mentha arvensis f. albensis, commonly known as the white hound's tongue, is a subspecies of field mint native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its pale green, almost white leaves and a more delicate, less aromatic scent compared to other mint varieties. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its flowering stems bear small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. While not as widely cultivated as other mints, it is valued in traditional herbal medicine for its mild antiseptic properties."
