    "intro": "Melica sarmentosa, commonly known as the creeping melic, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. The inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers."
