It is characterized by its unique, spirally arranged fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a compact growth habit and produces small, delicate sporangia on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its distinctive appearance, it is a popular specimen in botanical gardens and among fern enthusiasts."
