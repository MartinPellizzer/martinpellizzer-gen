    "intro": "Maria, commonly known as the marsh marigold, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetlands and damp areas in Europe and Asia. It features bright yellow flowers with four to eight petals, often appearing in early spring. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are broad and glossy, and it produces a distinctive, somewhat unpleasant odor. Its rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though it is primarily valued for its ornamental appeal. The marsh marigold thrives in moist soils and is often found near streams or in marshy habitats."
