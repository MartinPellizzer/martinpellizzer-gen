    "intro": "Mimosa concinna, commonly known as the sensitive plant or velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer seasons. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as fields and along roadsides. Mimosa concinna is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, which can make it a pioneer species in certain ecosystems."
