    "intro": "Matucana madisoniorum var. pujupatii, commonly known as the Pujupat\u00ed matucana, is a rare bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves that form a rosette, creating a water-holding cup typical of bromeliads. The plant produces vibrant orange-red inflorescences that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in high humidity and indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Due to its limited natural range and habitat threats, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
