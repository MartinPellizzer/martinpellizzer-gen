    "intro": "Mimulus minimus, commonly known as the small yellow monkeyflower, is a delicate annual herb native to the western United States. It typically grows to a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters, with slender stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The flowers are spurred at the back, a characteristic feature of the genus Mimulus, and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. It plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
