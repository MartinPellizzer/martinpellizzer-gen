    "intro": "Morus rotundiloba, commonly known as the round-leaf mulberry, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia, including countries like Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often pubescent on the underside. It produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically eaten by birds and other animals, aiding in seed dispersal. The tree is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity."
