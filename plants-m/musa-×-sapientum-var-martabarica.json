    "intro": "Musa \u00d7 sapientum var. martabarica, commonly known as the Martaban banana, is a variety of the common banana plant. It is characterized by its large, elongated, and slightly curved fruit, which is typically harvested when still green. The plant produces clusters of fruit, known as hands, which can contain dozens of individual bananas. Its leaves are broad and pointed, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. This variety is valued for its robust growth and ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates."
