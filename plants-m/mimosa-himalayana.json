    "intro": "Mimosa himalayana, commonly known as the Himalayan mimosa, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Asia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within its cells. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in spring, followed by elongated, bean-like pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Mimosa himalayana is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other regions for horticultural use."
