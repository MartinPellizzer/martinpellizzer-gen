    "intro": "Moehringia intricata subsp. tejedensis, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada range in California. It is a small, mat-forming perennial with hairy, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or lavender in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, alpine environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
