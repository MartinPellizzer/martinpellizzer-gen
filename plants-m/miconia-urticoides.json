    "intro": "Miconia urticoides, commonly known as the stinging miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, stinging hairs, which can cause irritation upon contact. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
