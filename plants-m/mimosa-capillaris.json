    "intro": "Mimosa capillaris, commonly known as the silky mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are sensitive to touch and will fold shut when disturbed, a trait known as thigmonastic response. Mimosa capillaris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
