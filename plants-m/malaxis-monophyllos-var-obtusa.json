    "intro": "Malaxis monophyllos var. obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leafed malaxis, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in association with other orchid species. The variety obtusa is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to the typical form of Malaxis monophyllos."
