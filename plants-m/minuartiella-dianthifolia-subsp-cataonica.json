    "intro": "Minuartiella dianthifolia subsp. cataonica, commonly known as the Cataonic rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the rocky and alpine regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its compact rosette of blue-green, fleshy leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is adapted to harsh, sunny environments. It is often found in crevices and on rocky outcrops, where it forms dense mats. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
