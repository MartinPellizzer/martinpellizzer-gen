    "intro": "Mimosa stipulacea, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found in disturbed soils. Its rapid leaf movement in response to stimuli makes it a popular subject in botanical studies."
