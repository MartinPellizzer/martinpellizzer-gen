    "intro": "Medicago sativa f. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf alfalfa, is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its smaller, more compact growth habit compared to standard alfalfa. It features trifoliate leaves composed of three small, rounded leaflets, and it produces yellow flowers in clusters. The plant is adapted to thrive in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. It is often used in forage production and as a cover crop due to its hardiness and ability to fix nitrogen. Its botanical features make it valuable in both agricultural and ecological contexts."
