    "intro": "Monteverdia psammophila, commonly known as the sandstone vine, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to arid environments. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, narrow leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or semi-arid regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
