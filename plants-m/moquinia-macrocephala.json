    "intro": "Moquinia macrocephala, commonly known as the broad-headed moquina, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer, forming dense, rounded clusters at the tips of the stems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist soils. Moquinia macrocephala is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
