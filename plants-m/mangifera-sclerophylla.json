    "intro": "Mangifera sclerophylla, commonly known as the rough-leaved mango, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are adapted to withstand dry conditions. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that eventually develop into edible mango fruits. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with a dense canopy that provides shade. The botanical features of Mangifera sclerophylla make it well-suited for cultivation in arid and semi-arid environments."
