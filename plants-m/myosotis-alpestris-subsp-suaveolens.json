    "intro": "Myosotis alpestris subsp. suaveolens, commonly known as the sweet-scented forget-me-not, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It features delicate blue to violet flowers with five petals, often surrounded by white or pale blue sepals. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high altitudes, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. The subspecies is distinguished by its fragrant, sweet scent, which is more pronounced than in other related species."
