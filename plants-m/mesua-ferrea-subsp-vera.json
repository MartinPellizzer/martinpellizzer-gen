    "intro": "Mesua ferrea subsp. vera, commonly known as the red sandalwood or Indian sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves with a glossy green upper surface. The tree produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its wood is highly valued for its aromatic properties and durability, though it is also critically endangered due to overharvesting and habitat loss. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various species."
