    "intro": "Miconia longisetosa, commonly known as the long-hair miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy textures. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia longisetosa is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain regions."
