    "intro": "Meisteria nudipes, commonly known as the silverleaf moonflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its large, velvety white petals that open at night, emitting a subtle fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves with a silvery underside, giving it its common name. Its flowering period occurs during the late summer to early autumn months. Due to its limited habitat and specific environmental requirements, Meisteria nudipes is considered a vulnerable species."
