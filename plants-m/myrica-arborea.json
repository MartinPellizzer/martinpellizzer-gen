    "intro": "Myrica arborea, commonly known as the wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often coated with a whitish, waxy cuticle, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. Myrica arborea is adapted to wetland environments and can tolerate periodic flooding. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
