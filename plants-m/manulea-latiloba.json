    "intro": "Manulea latiloba, commonly known as the broad-lobed manulea, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value."
