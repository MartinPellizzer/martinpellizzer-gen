    "intro": "Mentha longifolia var. striata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mint, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, aromatic leaves with a distinctive striated or ribbed texture along the leaf margins. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often used in culinary applications and traditional medicine due to their refreshing scent and menthol content. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in moist, shady environments."
