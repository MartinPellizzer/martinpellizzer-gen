    "intro": "Mercurialis ovata f. croatica, commonly known as the Croatian mercury plant, is a rare and distinctive botanical variant of the genus Mercurialis. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is native to the Balkan Peninsula, particularly Croatia. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, with a slightly hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
