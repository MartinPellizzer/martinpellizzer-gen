    "intro": "Mimosa morongii, commonly known as the Morong's sensitive plant, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold when touched, a trait known as thigmonastic movement. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, bean-like pods. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
