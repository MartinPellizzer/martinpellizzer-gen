    "intro": "Malus fusca, commonly known as the snow crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by edible, crabapple-like fruits. The plant typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and has dark green, oval-shaped leaves that turn reddish in the fall. Its bark is smooth and grayish, with a tendency to peel in thin layers. Malus fusca is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
