    "intro": "Maesa beamanii, commonly known as the Beaman's maesa, is a rare shrub native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in mountainous forests. Its leaves are thick and leathery, and it produces white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Maesa beamanii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
