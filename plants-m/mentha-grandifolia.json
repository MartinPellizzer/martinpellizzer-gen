    "intro": "Mentha grandifolia, commonly known as catnip, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom in late summer. Mentha grandifolia is known for its strong aromatic properties, primarily due to the presence of nepetalactone. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade."
