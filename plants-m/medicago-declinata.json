    "intro": "Medicago declinata, commonly known as the leaning medick, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing annual or biennial legume that thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant features trifoliate leaves and produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and the tendency of its stems to lean or trail along the ground. Medicago declinata plays a role in soil stabilization and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides."
