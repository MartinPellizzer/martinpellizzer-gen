    "intro": "Medicago falcata var. robusta, commonly known as the robust goat's rue, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves with a distinctive heart-shaped base. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in ecological restoration efforts."
