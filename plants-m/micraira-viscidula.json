    "intro": "Micraira viscidula, commonly known as the sticky micraira, is a small, herbaceous plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that produce a sticky substance, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in greenish-yellow clusters, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Micraira viscidula is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and potential ecological roles in its native habitat."
