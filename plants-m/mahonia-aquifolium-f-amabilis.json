It features holly-like leaves with dark green, glossy upper surfaces and silvery-white undersides, creating a striking visual contrast. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by blue-black berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value and hardiness in temperate climates."
