    "intro": "Muscari stenanthum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved grape hyacinth, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, resembling grapes, hence its common name. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. It is known for its fragrant blooms and ability to naturalize easily, creating dense stands over time. Muscari stenanthum is also valued for its early spring flowering, adding color to gardens when many other plants are still dormant."
