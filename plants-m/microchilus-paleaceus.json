    "intro": "Microchilus paleaceus, commonly known as the paleaceus fern, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in greenish-white clusters, and it produces berries that are edible for some wildlife. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in its native habitat."
