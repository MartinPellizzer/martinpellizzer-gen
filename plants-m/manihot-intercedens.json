It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that develop into berry-like fruits. The plant contains toxic compounds, including solanine and other alkaloids, which make it potentially harmful to humans and animals. It is often found in moist, shaded areas within tropical forests. Despite its toxicity, it has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
