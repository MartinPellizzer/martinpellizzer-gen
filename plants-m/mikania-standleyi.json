    "intro": "Mikania standleyi, commonly known as the Mexican devil's ivy, is a vigorous climbing vine native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, spiny fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a problematic weed in certain regions."
