    "intro": "Myoporum rapense subsp. kermadecense, commonly known as the Kermadec myoporum, is a shrub native to the Kermadec Islands in the South Pacific. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal environments. It is often found in coastal scrub and is relatively drought-tolerant. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
