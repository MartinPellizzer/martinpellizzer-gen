    "intro": "Melocarpum, commonly known as the false thistle, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, predominantly found in the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia. The plants are characterized by their spiny leaves and composite flower heads, which resemble those of true thistles. They typically grow in dry, rocky soils and are often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. Melocarpum species are generally herbaceous, with some species exhibiting semi-shrubby growth forms."
