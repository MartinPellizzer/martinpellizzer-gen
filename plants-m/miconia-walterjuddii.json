    "intro": "Miconia walterjuddii, commonly known as the Hawaiian miconia, is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers with five petals and numerous stamens, which bloom in clusters. It is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as mesic forests and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other tropical regions, though it is considered invasive in some areas."
