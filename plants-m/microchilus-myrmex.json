    "intro": "Microchilus myrmex, commonly known as the ant-like fern, is a small, delicate plant belonging to the family Microchilaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, clustered fronds that resemble the segmented bodies of ants, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are simple and often have a slightly hairy texture, which helps in retaining moisture. Microchilus myrmex is primarily found in temperate regions and is known for its unique appearance and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
