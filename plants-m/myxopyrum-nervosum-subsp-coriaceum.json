    "intro": "Myxopyrum nervosum subsp. coriaceum, commonly known as the rough hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its stiff, hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, dunes, and coastal areas. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small mammals."
