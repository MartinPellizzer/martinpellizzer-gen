It is characterized by its bright yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats such as streambanks and canyon walls. It has heart-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. This variety is distinguished by its shorter, more compact growth habit compared to other Mimulus species."
