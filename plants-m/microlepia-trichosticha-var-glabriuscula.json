    "intro": "Microlepia trichosticha var. glabriuscula, commonly known as the glabrous microlepia, is a variant of the fern Microlepia trichosticha. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically glabrous, meaning they lack hairs. The plant produces small, dark brown sporangia that are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. This variety is notable for its delicate appearance and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
