It features narrow, dark green leaves with a slight waxy coating, and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are edible but often used in traditional medicine. Myrtus auriculata is valued for its aromatic properties and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental and medicinal uses. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade."
