    "intro": "Miconia rupicola, commonly known as the rock miconia, is a shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a bright red, fleshy berry that attracts various birds and mammals. Miconia rupicola is often found growing on rocky slopes and in disturbed habitats due to its adaptability to poor soil conditions."
