    "intro": "Montia aquatica, commonly known as water bladdergrass, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is a small annual herb with slender, branching stems that often grow in water or very moist soil. The plant produces tiny white or pink flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and its leaves are alternate, linear, and often submerged or floating. Montia aquatica is adapted to aquatic conditions, with specialized structures that help it survive in waterlogged habitats. It plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
