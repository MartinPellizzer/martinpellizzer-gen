    "intro": "Morilloa piranii, commonly known as the Peruvian morning glory, is a climbing vine native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of blue and purple. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, temperate climates with well-drained soil. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardeners in suitable regions. However, it is considered invasive in some areas due to its aggressive spreading habit."
