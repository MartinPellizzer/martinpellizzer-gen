    "intro": "Myrica dentulata var. dentulata, commonly known as the rough-leaved wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its serrated, oval leaves that turn red in the fall, and its small, dark blue berries that are edible for birds and some mammals. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. It has a fragrant, waxy coating on its leaves, which contributes to its common name. This species is also valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
