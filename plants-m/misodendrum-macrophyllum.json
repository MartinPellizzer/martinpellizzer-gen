    "intro": "Misodendrum macrophyllum, commonly known as the large-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in tropical and subtropical regions. It possesses broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its often humid but variable environment. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the fleshy, red berries. The botanical features of Misodendrum macrophyllum reflect its adaptation to a parasitic lifestyle while maintaining some degree of photosynthetic capability."
