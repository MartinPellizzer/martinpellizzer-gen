It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clustered foliage. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
