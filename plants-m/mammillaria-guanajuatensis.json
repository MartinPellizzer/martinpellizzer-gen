It features a spiny, ribbed stem with prominent areoles that bear white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, red fruits that are typically eaten by birds and other animals. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated as a prized ornamental plant."
