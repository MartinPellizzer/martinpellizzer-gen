    "intro": "Muhlenbergia minutiflora, commonly known as the dwarf muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a fine texture. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flower heads in late summer, which are borne on slender, erect panicles. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens. Muhlenbergia minutiflora is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to form dense, low-growing mats."
