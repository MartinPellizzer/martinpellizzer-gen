    "intro": "Maba samoensis, commonly known as the Samoan maba, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to several meters. Its bark and leaves have been traditionally used in local medicine for their purported healing properties. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Maba samoensis is considered vulnerable in some areas."
