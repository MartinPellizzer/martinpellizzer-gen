    "intro": "Malachra heptaphylla, commonly known as the seven-leaf malachra, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes milkweeds and other toxic plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white in color. Its leaves are opposite and often have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Malachra heptaphylla is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in semi-arid conditions."
