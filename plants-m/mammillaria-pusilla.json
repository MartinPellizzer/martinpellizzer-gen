    "intro": "Mammillaria pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf mammillaria, is a small cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense covering of white to pale green spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cactus collections."
