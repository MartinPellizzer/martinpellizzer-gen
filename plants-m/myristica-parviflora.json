It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, dark brown seeds that are used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers and has glossy, elliptical leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in dense forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
