    "intro": "Minuartia caucasica, commonly known as the Caucasian rock-cress, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Caucasus region. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its small, pale green leaves and clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. It has a compact growth habit, allowing it to survive in harsh, mountainous conditions. Minuartia caucasica is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value."
