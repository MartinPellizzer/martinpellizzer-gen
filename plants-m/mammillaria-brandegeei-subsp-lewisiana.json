    "intro": "Mammillaria brandegeei subsp. lewisiana, commonly known as the Lewis's mammillaria, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular to cylindrical stem with prominent, white to pale yellow spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for succulent collectors."
