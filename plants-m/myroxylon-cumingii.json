    "intro": "Myroxylon cumingii, commonly known as the African teak, is a tropical tree native to western and central Africa. It is characterized by its large, spreading canopy and smooth, greyish-brown bark. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, seed-bearing pods. Its heartwood is highly valued for its durability and rich, dark color, making it a significant resource in traditional and commercial contexts. The plant also has medicinal uses in some local cultures."
