    "intro": "Muscari neglectum subsp. atlanticum, commonly known as the Atlantic grape hyacinth, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the coastal regions of the eastern Mediterranean and parts of southern Europe. It produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale blue to deep purple, resembling grape-like clusters. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal and saline environments. It is often found growing in open woodlands and along cliffs, where it benefits from full sun to partial shade. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in challenging coastal conditions."
