It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are typically opposite or whorled in arrangement. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological importance in native habitats."
