    "intro": "Macrothumia kuhlmannii, commonly known as the Kuhlmann's macrothumia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central America, particularly in countries like Mexico and Guatemala. The plant is characterized by its evergreen shrub form, with dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
