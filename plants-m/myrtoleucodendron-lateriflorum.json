    "intro": "Myrtoleucodendron lateriflorum, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange. The plant has glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its saline environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing near the edges of dunes or in rocky coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens."
