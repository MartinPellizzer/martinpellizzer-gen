    "intro": "Moranopteris hyalina, commonly known as the glassy moonwort, is a rare fern species belonging to the family Onocleaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that give it a glass-like appearance, hence its common name. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Moranopteris hyalina has a unique reproductive system, producing spores in specialized structures called sorus. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
