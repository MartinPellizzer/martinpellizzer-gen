    "intro": "Melinum, commonly known as redshank, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are annual or biennial herbs. The plants typically have slender stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink or red. Melinum species are often found in meadows, grasslands, and rocky areas, thriving in temperate climates. Their flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and they produce small, dry fruits containing several seeds."
