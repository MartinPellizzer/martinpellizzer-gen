    "intro": "Melica angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist meadows, stream banks, and other wet habitats, often forming dense, low-growing tufts. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for invertebrates. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of wetland and riparian ecosystems."
