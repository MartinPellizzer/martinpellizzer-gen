    "intro": "Meridiana longiscapa, commonly known as the long-stemmed meridiana, is a species of flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, umbel-like inflorescences. The plant produces white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Meridiana longiscapa is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats."
