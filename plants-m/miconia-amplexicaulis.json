    "intro": "Miconia amplexicaulis, commonly known as the clasping miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that often encircle the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red or orange berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
