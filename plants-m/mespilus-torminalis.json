    "intro": "Mespilus torminalis, commonly known as the medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny bark and its unique fruit, which has a rough, chestnut-like appearance when unripe. The fruit turns from green to yellowish-brown as it matures and is known for its aromatic, sweet-tart flavor when fully ripe. It produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by the development of its characteristic fruit. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
