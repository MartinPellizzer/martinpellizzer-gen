    "intro": "Microsorum polycarpon, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are divided into numerous small, finger-like segments. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in marshes and ponds. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Microsorum polycarpon is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
