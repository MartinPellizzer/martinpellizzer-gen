    "intro": "Melampyrum bihariense subsp. kuemmerlei, commonly known as the Himalayan touch-me-not, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange flowers arranged in spikes, which are often clustered at the ends of the branches. It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, typically found in rocky or grassy areas at high altitudes. This subspecies is notable for its hemiparasitic nature, deriving some of its nutrients from the roots of neighboring plants."
