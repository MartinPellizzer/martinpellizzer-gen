    "intro": "Musa hookeri, commonly known as the giant banana plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant produces long, fleshy pseudostems that support its flowering stems, which bear clusters of small, yellow flowers. Its fruits, although not typically eaten, are used in traditional medicine. Musa hookeri thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil."
