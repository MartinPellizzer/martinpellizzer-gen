    "intro": "Mimosa quadrivalvis var. latidens, commonly known as the broad-leaved sensitive plant, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response mediated by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaflets. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in spherical clusters, which are followed by flat, bean-like pods. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands. The species is noted for its rapid growth and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
