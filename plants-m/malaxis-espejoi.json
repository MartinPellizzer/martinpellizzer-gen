    "intro": "Malaxis espejoi, commonly known as the Espejo's Malaxis, is a rare orchid species native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive spurred lip, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
