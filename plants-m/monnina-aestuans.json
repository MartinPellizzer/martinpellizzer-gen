    "intro": "Monnina aestuans, commonly known as saltbush, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in saline or sandy soils, adapting well to harsh coastal environments. The plant produces small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often blooming in spring. Its leaves are usually small, fleshy, and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Monnina aestuans plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
