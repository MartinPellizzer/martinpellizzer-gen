    "intro": "Mespilus lalandei, commonly known as the Laland's medlar, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its distinctive, rough, and often fissured bark, which becomes more pronounced with age. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by unique, fleshy fruits that ripen in the fall. Its leaves are ovate with a serrated margin and a glossy upper surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Mespilus lalandei is considered a botanically significant and endangered species."
