    "intro": "Macrolobium campestre var. medium, commonly known as the Mexican flame tree, is a deciduous tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter, giving it a distinctive tropical appearance. The tree produces showy, clustered inflorescences of yellow-orange flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in warm climates. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is often used in urban landscaping and as a shade tree."
