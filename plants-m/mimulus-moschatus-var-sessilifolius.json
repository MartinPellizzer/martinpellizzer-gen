    "intro": "Mimulus moschatus var. sessilifolius, commonly known as the sessile-leaved monkeyflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along streambanks and wet meadows. Its leaves are sessile, meaning they lack stalks, and are arranged in a basal rosette. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in wet environments."
