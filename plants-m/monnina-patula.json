    "intro": "Monnina patula, commonly known as scarlet false flax, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces striking red to orange-pink flowers in the spring. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and thrives in well-drained soils, often found in dry, rocky habitats. It is part of the family Onagraceae, which includes other showy flowering plants. Monnina patula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
