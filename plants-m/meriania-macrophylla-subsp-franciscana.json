    "intro": "Meriania macrophylla subsp. franciscana, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its wood is highly valued for its rich tone and durability, making it a sought-after material in musical instrument making. However, due to overharvesting, it is now classified as critically endangered."
