It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to three meters in diameter, providing a unique habitat for various aquatic life. The plant's floating leaves are supported by long, flexible petioles that help it remain buoyant on the water's surface. Its flowers are typically white or pink, with a distinctive shape that attracts pollinators such as beetles. The plant plays an important ecological role in its environment by contributing to water oxygenation and supporting biodiversity."
