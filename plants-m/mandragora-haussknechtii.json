    "intro": "Mandragora haussknechtii, commonly known as the Hausknecht's mandrake, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its distinctive, fleshy roots and lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both botanical research and traditional medicine. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
