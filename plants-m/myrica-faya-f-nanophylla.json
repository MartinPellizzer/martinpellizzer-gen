    "intro": "Myrica faya f. nanophylla, commonly known as the dwarf myrica, is a shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a variant of the broader Myrica faya species, characterized by its smaller leaves and compact growth habit. This plant thrives in coastal and mesic habitats, often found on windward slopes. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, with a distinctive aromatic scent when crushed. The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native insects and birds."
