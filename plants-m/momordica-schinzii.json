    "intro": "Momordica schinzii, commonly known as the Schinz's bitter melon, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes other cucurbits like cucumbers and squash. The plant produces distinctive, warty, green fruits that turn orange when mature, often with a bitter taste due to the presence of alkaloids. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow with five petals. This species is often cultivated for its edible fruits, though they are typically consumed when young and tender."
