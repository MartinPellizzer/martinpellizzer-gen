    "intro": "Mangifera africana, commonly known as the African mango, is a tropical tree native to Central and West Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that develop into large, fibrous fruits with a sweet, aromatic pulp. The fruit is rich in nutrients and has been traditionally used for its medicinal properties. Its botanical significance lies in its role in local ecosystems and its potential for sustainable agricultural use."
