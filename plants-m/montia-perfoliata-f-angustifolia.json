It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its botanical features make it an attractive and ecologically valuable plant in native gardens."
