It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow, pea-like flowers. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used as a cover crop due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. Its hairy stems and leaves provide habitat for various insects and small animals."
