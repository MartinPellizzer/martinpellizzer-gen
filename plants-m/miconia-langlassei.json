    "intro": "Miconia langlassei, commonly known as the red miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from green to red or purple. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by distinctive, winged fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland tropical forests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
