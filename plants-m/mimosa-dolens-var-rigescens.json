    "intro": "Mimosa dolens var. rigescens, commonly known as the rigid mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value and unique leaf behavior, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
