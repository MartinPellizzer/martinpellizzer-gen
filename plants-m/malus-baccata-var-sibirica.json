    "intro": "Malus baccata var. sibirica, commonly known as the Siberian crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and its distinctive, elongated leaves that are often reddish when young. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, crabapple-like fruits that range in color from yellow to red. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its winter interest and hardy nature. The species is also notable for its ability to thrive in poor soils and withstand harsh climatic conditions."
