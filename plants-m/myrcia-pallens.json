    "intro": "Myrcia pallens, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Myrcia pallens has been introduced to other regions, including Florida, where it has become an invasive species."
