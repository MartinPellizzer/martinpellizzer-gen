    "intro": "Mansana, commonly known as the common barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring thorny stems and alternate, compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and role in supporting local wildlife."
