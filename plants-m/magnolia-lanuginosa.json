    "intro": "Magnolia lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly magnolia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, fuzzy, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive, almost woolly appearance. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in late spring to early summer, typically in shades of white to pale pink. Its leaves are elliptical and have a smooth texture, while its bark is smooth and grayish-brown. Magnolia lanuginosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats."
