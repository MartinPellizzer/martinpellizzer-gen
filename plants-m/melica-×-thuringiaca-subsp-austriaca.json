    "intro": "Melica \u00d7 thuringiaca subsp. austriaca, commonly known as the Austrian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairless stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences bearing small, two-lobed spikelets, which are typically green to purplish in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue and a prominent midrib. This subspecies is often found in moist meadows and along stream banks, where it contributes to soil stabilization and provides habitat for various invertebrates."
