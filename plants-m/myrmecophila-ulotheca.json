    "intro": "Myrmecophila ulotheca, commonly known as the ant-plant, is a tropical shrub characterized by its unique botanical features. It possesses specialized structures called domatia, which are hollow, cavity-like formations that provide shelter for ants. These domatia are typically found on the stems and leaves, offering a protected environment for the ants to reside. The plant forms a mutualistic relationship with certain ant species, which in turn protect the plant from herbivores. Myrmecophila ulotheca is native to regions in South America and is often found in humid, shaded environments."
