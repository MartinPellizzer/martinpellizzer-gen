    "intro": "Mammillaria diadema, commonly known as the Crowned Mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a dense covering of small, white to pale blue spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by pale green fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
