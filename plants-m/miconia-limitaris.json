    "intro": "Miconia limitaris, commonly known as the Hawaiian miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers with five petals, which bloom in clusters during the rainy season. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature. Miconia limitaris is also known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it a potential invasive species in certain environments."
