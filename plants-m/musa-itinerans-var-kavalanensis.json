It is a herbaceous plant with large, broad leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers followed by elongated, finger-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
