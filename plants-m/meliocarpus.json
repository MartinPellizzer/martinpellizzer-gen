    "intro": "Meliocarpus, commonly known as the yellow ironwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. These plants are native to various regions of Australia and are characterized by their hard, dense wood and distinctive yellow flowers. The leaves are typically bipinnate, meaning they are divided into smaller leaflets, which contribute to their ornamental appeal. Meliocarpus species are often found in dry, sandy soils and are adapted to arid environments. They play an important ecological role in their native habitats, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
