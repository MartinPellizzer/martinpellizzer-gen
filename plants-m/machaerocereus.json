    "intro": "Machaerocereus, commonly known as the night-blooming cereus, is a genus of cacti native to the Americas. These plants are characterized by their spiny stems and showy, nocturnal flowers that open at night. They typically have a columnar or branching growth form and are adapted to arid environments. The flowers are usually white or pale in color and emit a sweet fragrance to attract pollinators. Machaerocereus species are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value and ease of cultivation."
