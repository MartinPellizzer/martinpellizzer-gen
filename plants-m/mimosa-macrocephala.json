    "intro": "Mimosa macrocephala, commonly known as the sensitive plant or velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spherical heads, giving it its species name \"macrocephala,\" meaning \"large-headed.\" It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Mimosa macrocephala is also known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize open spaces, making it both a pioneer species and a potential weed."
