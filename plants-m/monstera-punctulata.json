    "intro": "Monstera punctulata, commonly known as the Swiss cheese plant, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that develop perforations as they mature. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Its aerial roots allow it to climb and support itself as it grows. Monstera punctulata is popular as a houseplant due to its striking foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
