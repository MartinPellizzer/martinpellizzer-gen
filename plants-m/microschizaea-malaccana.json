    "intro": "Microschizaea malaccana, commonly known as the Malacca liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its leafy, thalloid structure with closely arranged, linear leaves that form a dense carpet on moist, shaded soil. The plant typically grows in humid tropical and subtropical regions, often in forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including archegonia and antheridia, are located on the underside of the leaves. Microschizaea malaccana plays a vital role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its native habitats."
