    "intro": "Myrstiphyllum pubescens, commonly known as the velvet myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to New Zealand. It features dense, dark green foliage covered in fine, soft pubescence, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible, red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is cultivated in gardens and conservation efforts."
