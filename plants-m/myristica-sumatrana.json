    "intro": "Myristica sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran nutmeg tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Indonesian island of Sumatra. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, woody fruit that contains the valuable spice nutmeg. The tree produces a yellowish or redish fruit that ripens over several months, and the seeds inside are the source of nutmeg and mace. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as critically endangered."
