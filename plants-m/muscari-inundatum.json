    "intro": "Muscari inundatum, commonly known as the Italian squill, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bell-shaped blue or purple flowers. The plant produces a basal rosette of strap-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. Muscari inundatum thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early spring blooming habit."
