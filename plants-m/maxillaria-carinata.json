It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, ridged pseudobulbs. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with a contrasting lip. Its leaves are linear and arranged in two rows, contributing to its compact appearance. Maxillaria carinata thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light."
