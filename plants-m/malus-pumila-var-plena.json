    "intro": "Malus pumila var. plena, commonly known as the Flowering Crabapple, is a cultivar of the crabapple tree known for its abundant, showy flowers. It is characterized by its dense, double or semi-double blooms that appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, typically growing to a height of 6 to 10 feet. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a glossy green surface and turn yellow in the fall. The fruit, though small and not typically eaten by humans, is used in some traditional remedies and can attract wildlife."
