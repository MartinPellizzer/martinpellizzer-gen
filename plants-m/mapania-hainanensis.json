It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and leathery leaves. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments within tropical forests. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered endangered."
