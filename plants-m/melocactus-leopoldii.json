    "intro": "Melocactus leopoldii, commonly known as the leopard cactus, is a species native to northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, thick stems that are often covered in white, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
