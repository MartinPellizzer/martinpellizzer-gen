It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves with a distinct marginal notch. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its fruit is a smooth, fleshy drupe that turns red when mature, containing a single seed. Melicope emarginata is often found in coastal and lowland forest habitats, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
