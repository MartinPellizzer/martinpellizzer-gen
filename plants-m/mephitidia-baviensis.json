    "intro": "Mephitidia baviensis, commonly known as the Baviensian Mephit, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty highlands of Bavi. It features striking violet petals with a subtle iridescent sheen, and its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its humid environment. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Its root system is particularly deep, allowing it to access nutrients from the nutrient-poor soils of its habitat."
