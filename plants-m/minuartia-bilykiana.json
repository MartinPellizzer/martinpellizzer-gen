It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes many flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It has a compact, cushion-like structure with dense, upright leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Minuartia bilykiana is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in its natural habitat."
