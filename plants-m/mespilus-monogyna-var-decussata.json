It is characterized by its small, white flowers that appear in clusters and its elliptical, dark green leaves that often have a distinctive crinkled texture. The fruit is a small, round drupe that turns from green to yellow or red when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along riverbanks. This variety is notable for its historical significance in traditional medicine and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
