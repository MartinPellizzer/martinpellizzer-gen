    "intro": "Myrsine yateensis, commonly known as the Yate's myrsine, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. Its small, white flowers are clustered in inflorescences, and it produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological role in New Zealand's flora."
