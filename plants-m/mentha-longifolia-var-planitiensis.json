    "intro": "Mentha longifolia var. planitiensis, commonly known as the Greek pennyroyal, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clusters of tiny, pale blue to violet flowers. The plant produces a strong, mint-like aroma due to the presence of essential oils, particularly menthone and pulegone. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is often cultivated for its aromatic properties and historical use in traditional medicine."
