    "intro": "Mentha \u00d7 piperita var. piperoides, commonly known as peppermint, is a hybrid perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, dark green, slightly hairy leaves and its strong, menthol-rich scent. The plant produces small, pale purple flowers that bloom in whorls along the square, hairy stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Peppermint is widely cultivated for its essential oils, which are used in aromatherapy, medicine, and as a flavoring agent."
