    "intro": "Margarocarpus cinerascens, commonly known as the ash-gray sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, ash-gray bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The tree has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape and often have a slightly waxy texture. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically greenish-yellow and appear in clusters, followed by small, spherical fruits. The plant is valued for its durable wood and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in lowland forests."
