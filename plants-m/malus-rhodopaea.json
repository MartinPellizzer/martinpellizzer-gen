It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in early spring. The tree produces small, red or yellow apples that are edible but not typically cultivated for commercial use. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes.
