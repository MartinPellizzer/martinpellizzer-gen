    "intro": "Mimosa tequilana, commonly known as the Mexican mimosa, is a shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimuli. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
