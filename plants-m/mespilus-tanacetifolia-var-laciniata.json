    "intro": "Mespilus tanacetifolia var. laciniata, commonly known as the cut-leaf medlar, is a variant of the medlar tree characterized by its finely lobed, almost fern-like leaves. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. The plant produces small, edible fruits that ripen in late autumn, though they are often not cultivated for commercial use. Its ornamental value lies in its attractive foliage and distinctive floral structure. The species is also valued for its historical and medicinal uses in traditional herbal practices."
