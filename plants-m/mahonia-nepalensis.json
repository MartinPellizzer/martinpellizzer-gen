    "intro": "Mahonia nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal mahonia, is a deciduous shrub native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and northern India. It is characterized by its evergreen, compound leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, with a leathery texture. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in racemes and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its berries, which are dark blue to black in color, are edible but often have a tart flavor. Mahonia nepalensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types."
