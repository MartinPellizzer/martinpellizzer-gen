    "intro": "Monanthes brachycaulos var. nivata, commonly known as the snow-lace plant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine regions of the northern hemisphere. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a short, thick stem and produces numerous tiny, clustered flowers that resemble lace, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its botanical structure is characterized by its compact growth habit and specialized floral morphology suited for pollination by insects in harsh climates."
