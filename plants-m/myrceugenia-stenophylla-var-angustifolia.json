    "intro": "Myrceugenia stenophylla var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved strawberry tree, is a species native to the temperate rainforests of southern South America. It is a evergreen shrub or small tree characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are typically narrow and elongated. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, cool climates and is often found in cloud forests where high humidity supports its growth. The plant has a slow growth rate and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
