    "intro": "Maxillaria cerifera, commonly known as the candle wax orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces fragrant, candle-like flowers in shades of white, pink, and lavender. The plant typically blooms during the summer months, and its flowers are known for their waxy texture and subtle fragrance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate humidity and well-draining soil. Maxillaria cerifera is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
