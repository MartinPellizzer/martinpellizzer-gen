    "intro": "Molineria crassifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to New Zealand. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, with a dense cluster of flowering spikes at the center. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by the development of distinctive, three-lobed seed pods. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Molineria crassifolia is valued for its ecological role in supporting native insect populations and its ornamental appeal in gardens."
