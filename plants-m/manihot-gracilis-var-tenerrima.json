It features slender, erect stems with alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is cultivated for its starchy, edible roots, which are similar in texture to yams and cassava. Due to its ornamental value and nutritional benefits, it is sometimes grown in subtropical gardens."
