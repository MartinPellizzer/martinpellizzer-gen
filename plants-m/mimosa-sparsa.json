    "intro": "Mimosa sparsa, commonly known as the slender mimosa, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are sensitive to touch, folding shut when disturbed. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for dry, rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
