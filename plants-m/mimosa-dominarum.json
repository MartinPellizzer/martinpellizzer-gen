    "intro": "Mimosa dominarum, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, feathery leaves that fold shut when touched. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. Its rapid leaf movement is a defense mechanism against herbivores and environmental stress. Mimosa dominarum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and responsive behavior."
