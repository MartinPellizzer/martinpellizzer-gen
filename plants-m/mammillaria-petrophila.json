    "intro": "Mammillaria petrophila, commonly known as the rock hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and is covered in white, woolly spines. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
