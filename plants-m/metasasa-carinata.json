    "intro": "Metasasa carinata, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to deep red, often with a prominent yellow throat. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually large, heart-shaped, and covered in a fine, waxy coating. Metasasa carinata plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small wildlife."
