    "intro": "Mentha spicata var. longifolia, commonly known as hedge mint, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often glandular and aromatic. The plant produces small, pale purple to white flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. This variety is widely used in herbal medicine and as a culinary herb due to its strong minty fragrance and medicinal properties."
