    "intro": "Muscarella kennedyi, commonly known as Kennedy's muscarine, is a rare species of fungi belonging to the family Coprinaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive cap, which is initially convex and becomes broadly\u4f1e\u72b6 with age. The gills are closely spaced and turn reddish-brown as they mature. This species is known for its hallucinogenic properties due to the presence of muscimol and other psychoactive compounds. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments, often associated with decaying wood or leaf litter."
