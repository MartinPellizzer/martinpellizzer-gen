    "intro": "Mimosa ramboi, commonly known as the pink mimosa, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and pod-like fruits. The plant features delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response known as thigmonasty. Its flowers are typically pink or lavender in color, arranged in loose, branching clusters. Mimosa ramboi thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
