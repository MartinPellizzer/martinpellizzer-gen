    "intro": "Musgravea heterophylla, commonly known as the musgravea with variable leaves, is a unique member of the Bromeliaceae family native to Brazil. It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that can range from red to orange, often resembling a flower. The plant exhibits heterophylly, meaning it has different leaf forms depending on its growth conditions, with some leaves being narrow and others broad. Its rosette structure helps it retain moisture, adapting to its natural habitat in humid, shaded environments. Musgravea heterophylla is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
