    "intro": "Mastichodendron tikalense, commonly known as the Tikal tree, is a rare and ancient plant native to the humid lowland forests of northern Guatemala. It is characterized by its thick, woody trunk and large, elongated leaves that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible, fleshy fruits that are consumed by various wildlife species. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered endangered and is protected in some regions. Its unique morphology and ecological importance make it a significant species in the study of tropical flora."
