    "intro": "Minuartia hybrida var. palaestina, commonly known as the Palestinian rock cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Middle East. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a mat-forming habit, with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as cliffs and slopes. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
