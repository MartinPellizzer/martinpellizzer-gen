    "intro": "Melhania stipulosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Melhania stipulosa is often found in moist, disturbed habitats and can become invasive in certain regions."
