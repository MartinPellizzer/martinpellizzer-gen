    "intro": "Mimosa mitzi, commonly known as the Mexican mimosa, is a shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait known as thigmonasty. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens in warm climates. Mimosa mitzi is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
