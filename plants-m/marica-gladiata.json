    "intro": "Marica gladiata, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that resemble a sword, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Marica gladiata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its attractive, feathery foliage."
