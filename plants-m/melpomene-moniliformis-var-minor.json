    "intro": "Melpomene moniliformis var. minor, commonly known as the lesser coralroot, is an epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. This species lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, making it a unique example of a heterotrophic plant. It typically grows on trees or rocks, forming dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant's roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the fungal network rather than through photosynthesis. Its delicate appearance and specialized growth habits make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies."
