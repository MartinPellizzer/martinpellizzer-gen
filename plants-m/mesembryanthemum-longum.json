It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and leaves. It blooms during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. Mesembryanthemum longum is often grown as an ornamental plant for its hardy nature and attractive appearance."
