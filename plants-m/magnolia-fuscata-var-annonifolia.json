    "intro": "Magnolia fuscata var. annonifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf magnolia, is a rare and unique variant of the magnolia species. It is characterized by its large, broad, ovate leaves that are often described as resembling those of the annonaceae family, hence its name. The plant produces showy, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern China and is typically found in moist, shaded forest environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
