    "intro": "Myrtus fimbriata, commonly known as the fringed myrtle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers and narrow, leathery leaves with a distinctive fringed edge. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional herbal medicine. Myrtus fimbriata is well-suited to coastal and rocky habitats due to its drought tolerance and salt resistance."
