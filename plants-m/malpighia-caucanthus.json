    "intro": "Malpighia caucanthus, commonly known as the caucanthus passionflower, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that resemble those of the passionfruit plant, with a complex structure of petals, sepals, and stamens. The plant produces small, edible berries that are often consumed fresh or used in culinary applications. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy surface, while its stems are hairy and climbing. Malpighia caucanthus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
