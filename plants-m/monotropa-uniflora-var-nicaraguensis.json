    "intro": "Monotropa uniflora var. nicaraguensis, commonly known as the Nicaraguan ghostplant, is a member of the Monotropaceae family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a mycoheterotroph. It relies on forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to obtain nutrients, rather than photosynthesis. The plant produces a single, showy white flower that attracts specific pollinators. It is typically found in shaded, moist forest understories in Central America. Its unique ecological role highlights its adaptation to nutrient-poor environments through fungal associations."
