    "intro": "Mentha riparia var. umbraticola, commonly known as the shade mint, is a variant of the water mint species native to moist, shaded environments. It typically grows in riparian zones, along stream banks, and in woodland areas where there is consistent moisture. The plant has slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often darker in color due to its shaded habitat. Its flowers are small, tubular, and usually pink or purple, appearing in whorls along the stem. This variety is valued for its aromatic leaves and its role in supporting local pollinators and aquatic ecosystems."
