    "intro": "Melica balansae, commonly known as Balansae grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and riverbanks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
