    "intro": "Microsemma leratii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved microsemma, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae, which includes many ornamental and horticulturally significant species. The plant is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of tubular, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Microsemma leratii is considered a conservation concern."
