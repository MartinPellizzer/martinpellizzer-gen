    "intro": "Muehlenbeckia hastulata var. rotundata, commonly known as the roundleaf muhlenbeckia, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It features slender, trailing stems that produce small, oval-shaped leaves with a smooth, waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value comes from its compact growth habit and attractive foliage."
