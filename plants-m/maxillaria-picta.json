    "intro": "Maxillaria picta, commonly known as the painted maxillaria, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, colorful flowers that often feature intricate patterns and a wide range of hues. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Maxillaria picta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
