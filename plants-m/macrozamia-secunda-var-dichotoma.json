    "intro": "Macrozamia secunda var. dichotoma, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to the tropical rainforests of northeastern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its short, stocky trunk and a rosette of large, glossy, dark green, feather-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It has a slow growth rate and is adapted to thrive in shaded, moist environments. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is protected in its natural habitat."
