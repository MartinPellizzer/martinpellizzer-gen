    "intro": "Monticalia gelida, commonly known as the cold mountain orchid, is a rare and frost-tolerant plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often pale-colored flowers adapted to cold climates. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments where temperatures remain low year-round. Its leaves are usually small and succulent, helping to retain moisture in harsh conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, Monticalia gelida is considered a vulnerable species."
