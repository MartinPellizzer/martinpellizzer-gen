    "intro": "Marilaunidium macranthum, commonly known as the large-flowered marilaunidium, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, showy white to pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic when crushed, a common trait in the carrot family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
