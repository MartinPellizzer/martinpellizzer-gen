    "intro": "Millettia nudiflora, commonly known as the naked-flower millettia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, often greyish bark and simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which appear before the leaves in early spring. Its fruit is a legume, containing several seeds, and it is often found in disturbed soils or along riverbanks. Millettia nudiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
