    "intro": "Meconopsis heterophylla, commonly known as the Himalayan blue poppy, is a striking alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant blue or purple petals and its ability to thrive in high-altitude environments. The plant has elliptical, hairy leaves that vary in shape depending on the growing conditions. It produces showy flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its habitat specificity and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and protected species in many areas."
