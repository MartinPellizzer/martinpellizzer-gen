    "intro": "Mapania palustris var. palustris, commonly known as the swamp mapania, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually arranged in a rosette pattern. Its small, white or pale pink flowers bloom in summer, often in clusters at the base of the plant. This species plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
