    "intro": "Muscarella intonsa, commonly known as the slender muscaria, is a species of mushroom belonging to the family Boletaceae. It is characterized by its pale yellow to cream-colored cap and a slender, often curved stem. The gills are typically pale yellow and do not change color when bruised. It is found in temperate regions, often growing in association with coniferous trees. This species is not considered edible and is generally avoided due to its lack of distinctive flavor and potential for confusion with other mushroom species."
