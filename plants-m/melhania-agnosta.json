    "intro": "Melhania agnosta, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are followed by orange or red berries containing a single seed. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. The sap of Melhania agnosta is milky and can be toxic if ingested, so caution is advised when handling the plant."
