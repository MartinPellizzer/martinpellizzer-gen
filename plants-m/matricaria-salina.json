    "intro": "Matricaria salina, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple ray florets and yellow disk flowers, which resemble those of the common daisy. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often growing in rocky or sandy coastal environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Matricaria salina is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
