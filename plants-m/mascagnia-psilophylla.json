    "intro": "Mascagnia psilophylla, commonly known as the slender leaf mescal bean, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many toxic plants, and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its small, berry-like fruits contain seeds that are dispersed by animals, contributing to its survival in arid environments. Mascagnia psilophylla is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
