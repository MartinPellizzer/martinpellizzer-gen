    "intro": "Melocactus oreas subsp. cremnophilus, commonly known as the rock melon cactus, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, powdery bloom, which helps to reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the base of the stem. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun exposure, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
