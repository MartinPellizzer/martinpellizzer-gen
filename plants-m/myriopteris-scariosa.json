    "intro": "Myriopteris scariosa, commonly known as the scaly cliff brake, is a small fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in a fine, scaly texture, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and dry slopes, thriving in well-drained, acidic soils. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself in challenging environments. Myriopteris scariosa is an important component of the understory in chaparral and pine forest ecosystems."
