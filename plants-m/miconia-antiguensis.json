    "intro": "Miconia antiguensis, commonly known as the Antigua miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean region. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions, though it can become invasive in some areas."
