It is characterized by its showy, star-shaped white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant has narrow, dark green leaves that provide a striking contrast to its blossoms. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often used in gardens for its early spring floral display."
