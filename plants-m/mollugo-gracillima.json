    "intro": "Mollugo gracillima, commonly known as slender sandpennywort, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to sandy soils in coastal regions. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to stabilize loose, sandy substrates. Mollugo gracillima is often found in dunes and other coastal habitats where it plays a role in preventing soil erosion."
