    "intro": "Melica commutata, commonly known as the narrowleaf brome, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers. Melica commutata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
