    "intro": "Maytenus buxifolia subsp. monticola, commonly known as the mountain mayten, is a shrub or small tree native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by orange-red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in humid, temperate climates and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
