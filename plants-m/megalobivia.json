    "intro": "Megalobivia, commonly known as the giant leaf vine, is a striking plant characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 feet in diameter. Native to tropical regions, it thrives in warm, humid climates with abundant sunlight. The plant's stems are woody and can grow quite long, making it an excellent choice for trellises or vertical gardens. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often appearing in shades of yellow or orange. Megalobivia is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for with proper watering and soil conditions."
