    "intro": "Machaerium piresii, commonly known as the Pires' machaerium, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant is a shrub or small tree, typically reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, and it produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Machaerium piresii is often found in dry forests and savannas, where it plays a role in soil enrichment through its nitrogen-fixing ability."
