It typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in disturbed or secondary forest habitats. The plant features opposite, simple leaves that are elliptical to ovate in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals. Maytenus multiflora is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes."
