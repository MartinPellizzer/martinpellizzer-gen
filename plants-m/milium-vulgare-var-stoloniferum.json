    "intro": "Milium vulgare var. stoloniferum, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its mat-forming growth habit and hairy, silver-gray foliage. It produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and disturbed areas. Its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth allows it to spread readily, forming dense colonies. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in erosion control due to its hardy nature."
