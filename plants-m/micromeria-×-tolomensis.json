    "intro": "Micromeria \u00d7 tolomensis, commonly known as the hybrid desert sand verbena, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Micromeria \u00d7 tolomensis is a resilient plant that plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
