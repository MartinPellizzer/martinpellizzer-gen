    "intro": "Malaxis hippocrepiformis, commonly known as the horsehead orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, horsehead-shaped floral structure, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow, with a distinctive, elongated lip that mimics the shape of a horse's head. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in protected rainforest environments."
