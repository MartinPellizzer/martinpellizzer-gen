    "intro": "Macodes xanthophyllus, commonly known as the golden-flowered maccaw, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
