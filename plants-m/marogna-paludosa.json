    "intro": "Marogna paludosa, commonly known as the marsh mallow, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It features slender, erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, aiding in moisture retention. Marogna paludosa is often found in marshes, swamps, and other moist environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
