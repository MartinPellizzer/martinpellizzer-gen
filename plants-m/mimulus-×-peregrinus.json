    "intro": "Mimulus \u00d7 peregrinus, commonly known as the hybrid monkey flower, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It is a cross between Mimulus guttatus and Mimulus luteus, resulting in a plant with distinctive yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and features slender, branching stems covered in hairy foliage. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in streambanks and moist meadows. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to native gardens."
