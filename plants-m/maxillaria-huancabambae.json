It is a terrestrial orchid with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its high-altitude habitat. The plant produces fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white and pink, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. This orchid is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by enthusiasts for its unique floral display."
