    "intro": "Mentha aquatica var. minor, commonly known as water mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet meadows, stream banks, and other damp habitats, thriving in areas with consistent moisture. The plant features slender, square stems and opposite leaves that are often serrated and aromatic. Its small, pale blue to purple flowers appear in whorled clusters, and it is known for its refreshing, minty fragrance. This variety is closely related to other Mentha species and is often used in herbal teas and traditional medicine."
