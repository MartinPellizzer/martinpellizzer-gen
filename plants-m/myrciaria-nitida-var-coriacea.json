    "intro": "Myrciaria nitida var. coriacea, commonly known as the rough myrtle, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves that are rough to the touch. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers followed by edible, tart berries. Its leaves and fruits are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The rough texture of its leaves is due to the presence of fine, stiff hairs on the surface."
