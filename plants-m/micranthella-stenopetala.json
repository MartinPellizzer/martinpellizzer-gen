    "intro": "Micranthella stenopetala, commonly known as the narrow-petaled rock bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. The plant has a compact growth habit, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to cold, arid environments. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
