    "intro": "Melastoma muscosum, commonly known as the velvetleaf or stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its soft, velvety leaves covered in fine hairs, which can cause skin irritation upon contact. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Melastoma muscosum is known for its allelopathic properties, where it releases chemicals that inhibit the growth of nearby plants."
