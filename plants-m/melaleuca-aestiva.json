    "intro": "Melaleuca aestiva, commonly known as the coastal melaleuca, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom. The plant produces small, bottlebrush-like flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom in spring and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its bark is smooth and peels in thin, papery layers, and it is often found in sandy soils near the coast. Melaleuca aestiva is adapted to salt-laden winds and can tolerate periodic flooding, making it a resilient plant in coastal ecosystems."
