    "intro": "Mabea occidentalis var. genuina, commonly known as the Mexican yew, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. The plant has a compact growth habit with multiple stems and is often found in rocky or well-drained soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and adaptability. However, it is important to note that the plant contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
