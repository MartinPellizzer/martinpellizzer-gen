    "intro": "Melilotus longifolius, commonly known as sweet clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family. It is characterized by its fragrant yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves, which are composed of three small leaflets. The plant is native to Europe and Asia but has been introduced to other regions, including North America. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas. Sweet clover is valued for its role in soil nitrogen fixation and as a forage crop for livestock."
