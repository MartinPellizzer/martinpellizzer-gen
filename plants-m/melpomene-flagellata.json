    "intro": "Melpomene flagellata, commonly known as the red flag flower, is a striking member of the Melastomataceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its vibrant red petals and long, slender sepals that resemble a flag, giving it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, especially hummingbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure."
