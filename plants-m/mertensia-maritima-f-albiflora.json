    "intro": "Mertensia maritima f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered coastal bluebell, is a rare and striking variant of the coastal bluebell. It is characterized by its pale to white flowers, which contrast with the typical blue or purple hues of the species. This plant is native to the coastal regions of the northeastern United States, where it thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically blooms in early spring. The plant's botanical features make it a valuable subject for study in coastal botany and conservation efforts."
