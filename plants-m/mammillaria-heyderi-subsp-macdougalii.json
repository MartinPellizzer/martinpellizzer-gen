    "intro": "Mammillaria heyderi subsp. macdougalii, commonly known as the MacDougal's hedgehog cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It features a globular shape with a short, cylindrical stem and produces clusters of white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. The plant has a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that help protect it from intense sunlight and moisture loss. It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appearance. This subspecies is relatively easy to cultivate, making it a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
