It features a globular stem with prominent, whitish tubercles that bear short, spiny bristles. The flowers are typically yellow or orange, emerging from areoles on the stem. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. This subspecies is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in succulent gardens."
