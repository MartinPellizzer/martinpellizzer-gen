    "intro": "Maytenus lineata, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets that are often arranged in pairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Maytenus lineata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits. However, it can become invasive in certain regions, posing challenges to native ecosystems."
