    "intro": "Mimosa spinosissima, commonly known as the spiny mimosa, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves that close when touched, a response triggered by touch-sensitive cells. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy species in temperate climates. Its unique defensive mechanism and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardens and botanical collections."
