    "intro": "Mecranium integrifolium subsp. alainii, commonly known as the Alain's broadleaf mecranium, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that are typically smooth-edged and have a glossy surface. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are usually a combination of white and pink, with a distinctive tubular shape. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
