    "intro": "Meniscium angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved meniscium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white to pale blue flowers appear in clusters during the summer months. The foliage and flowers are often used in herbal remedies, though its medicinal properties remain largely under-researched."
