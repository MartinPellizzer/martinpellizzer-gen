    "intro": "Mimosa quadrijuga, commonly known as the four-way mimosa, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in forest understories. The plant features small, bipinnate leaves that are sensitive to touch, causing them to fold when disturbed. Its flowers are pale yellow and appear in clusters, blooming in the spring. Mimosa quadrijuga is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for various pollinators."
