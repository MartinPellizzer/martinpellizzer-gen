It is a small shrub characterized by its aromatic, dark green leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and coastal scrub environments. This variety is notable for its resilience to salt spray and its role in supporting local wildlife."
