    "intro": "Meibomia lasiocarpa, commonly known as the rough-hair tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its woody structure and dense, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round fruits. Its leaves are often covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. Meibomia lasiocarpa is adapted to grow in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories."
