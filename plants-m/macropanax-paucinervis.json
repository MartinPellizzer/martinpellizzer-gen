    "intro": "Macropanax paucinervis, commonly known as the few-veined macropanax, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, compound leaves with a minimal number of veins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by dark berries as its fruit. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
