    "intro": "Melanthesa rhamnoides var. hypoglauca, commonly known as the pale-green salsify, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features upright stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbel-like clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its root system is fleshy and edible, though it is less commonly cultivated than other varieties of salsify. The varietal name 'hypoglauca' refers to its pale green coloration, distinguishing it from other forms of the species."
