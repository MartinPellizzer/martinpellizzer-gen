    "intro": "Mammillaria tiegeliana, commonly known as the Tiegeli's bunny ear cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular shape with white to pale green stems covered in small, rounded tubercles. The plant produces showy yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
