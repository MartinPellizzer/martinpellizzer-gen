    "intro": "Mahonia calamicaulis, commonly known as the creeping mahonia, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and its ability to form thick mats of foliage. The plant features holly-like leaves that are dark green and glossy, with spiny margins. It produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by blue-black berries. Mahonia calamicaulis is well adapted to rocky soils and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
