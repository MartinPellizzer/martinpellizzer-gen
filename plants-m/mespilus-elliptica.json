    "intro": "Mespilus elliptica, commonly known as the European medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces edible, fleshy fruits that ripen in the autumn, though they are often harvested when partially decayed for their unique flavor. Mespilus elliptica is adapted to temperate climates and thrives in well-drained soils. It has historical significance in horticulture and traditional medicine."
