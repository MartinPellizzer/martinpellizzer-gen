    "intro": "Minuartia eurytanica, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Minuartia eurytanica is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is often found in high-altitude or polar ecosystems."
