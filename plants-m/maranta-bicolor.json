    "intro": "Maranta bicolor, commonly known as the prayer plant, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, variegated leaves that often display shades of green, white, and pink. The plant's leaves fold upwards at night, a behavior known as nyctinasty, which is believed to help conserve moisture. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Maranta bicolor is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
