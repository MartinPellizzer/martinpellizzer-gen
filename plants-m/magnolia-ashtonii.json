    "intro": "Magnolia ashtonii, commonly known as the Ashe magnolia, is a rare and flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, showy, white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves and is typically found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. It belongs to the Magnoliaceae family and is known for its ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
