    "intro": "Moraea knersvlaktensis, commonly known as the Knysna moraea, is a striking member of the Iridaceae family native to South Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep red. The plant typically blooms in late winter to early spring, making it a notable addition to local flora during this season. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation efforts aim to protect its natural habitat."
