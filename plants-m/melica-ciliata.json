    "intro": "Melica ciliata, commonly known as the silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with fine, silky hairs along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and wetlands. Melica ciliata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
