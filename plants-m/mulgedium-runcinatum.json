    "intro": "Mulgedium runcinatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mulgedium, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of Europe. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, with slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are usually less than 5 centimeters in length, with a slightly serrated margin. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers bloom in clusters during the summer months. Mulgedium runcinatum is often found in moist meadows and along stream banks, where it thrives in well-drained, loamy soils."
