It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and its striking, lantern-shaped inflorescences that bloom in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are often clustered together, giving it a dramatic and ornamental appearance. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil and partial shade. Medinilla multiflora is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
