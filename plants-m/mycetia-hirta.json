    "intro": "Mycetia hirta, commonly known as the hairy mycetia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, often reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its seeds are encased in a hard pod, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in poor soils due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities. Mycetia hirta is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
