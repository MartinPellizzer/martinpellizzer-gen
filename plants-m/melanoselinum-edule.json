    "intro": "Melanoselinum edule, commonly known as the black garlic plant, is a perennial herb native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its dark purple to black leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is notable for its unique, pungent aroma, which is attributed to the presence of sulfur-containing compounds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
