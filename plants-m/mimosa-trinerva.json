    "intro": "Mimosa trinerva, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family. It is native to South America and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Mimosa trinerva is also known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it an important plant in soil enrichment."
