    "intro": "Miconia leagrayana, commonly known as the red-leaved miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically bright red or orange-red in color, which stand out prominently against its green stems. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that are often followed by bright red or orange fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
