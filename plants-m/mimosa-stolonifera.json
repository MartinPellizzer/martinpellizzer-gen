    "intro": "Mimosa stolonifera, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Mimosa stolonifera is a herbaceous perennial that spreads via stolons, making it a common ornamental plant in gardens."
