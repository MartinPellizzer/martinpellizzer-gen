    "intro": "Micrechites radicans, commonly known as creeping micrechites, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground or over other plants. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often with a slight fragrance. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Micrechites radicans thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental landscaping for its ability to cover ground effectively."
