    "intro": "Miliusa agasthyamalana, commonly known as the Nilgiri miliusa, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible, red drupes with a sweet, aromatic pulp. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats at elevations between 1,000 and 2,000 meters. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
