    "intro": "Monteverdia aquifolium, commonly known as the silverleaf holly, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It features dark green, leathery leaves that are glossy and often have a silvery underside, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its year-round interest and ability to attract wildlife."
