    "intro": "Musa \u00d7 sapientum var. vittata, commonly known as the spotted banana, is a cultivar of the banana plant characterized by its distinctive variegated foliage. The leaves exhibit a striking pattern of green and white or yellow markings, which set it apart from typical banana plants. This variety is primarily grown as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal rather than for fruit production. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. The plant is relatively slow-growing and can reach heights of up to 3 meters, making it a popular choice for tropical gardens."
