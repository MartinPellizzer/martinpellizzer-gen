    "intro": "Macairea maguirei, commonly known as the Maguire's macairea, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
