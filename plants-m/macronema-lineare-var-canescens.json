    "intro": "Macronema lineare var. canescens, commonly known as the silver-stemmed marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It features slender, cylindrical stems that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Its flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and it blooms during the late spring to early summer. This variety is adapted to moist soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
