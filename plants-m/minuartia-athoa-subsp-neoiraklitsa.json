    "intro": "Minuartia athoa subsp. neoiraklitsa, commonly known as the Balkan rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale pink. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils, often found in alpine or subalpine regions of the Balkans. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
