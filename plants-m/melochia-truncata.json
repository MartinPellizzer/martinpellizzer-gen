    "intro": "Melochia truncata, commonly known as the African spinach or broadleaf mallow, is a tropical shrub native to Africa and parts of Asia. It features large, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and prominent veins. The plant produces showy, pale pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release small, round seeds. Melochia truncata is often cultivated for its edible leaves, which are rich in nutrients and used in traditional cuisines."
