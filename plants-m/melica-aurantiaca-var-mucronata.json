It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces clusters of bright red to orange spikelets that give it its striking appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its inflorescence consists of compact, spike-like clusters, and the leaves are narrow and grass-like in appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant color."
