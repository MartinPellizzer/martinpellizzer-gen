It is a perennial shrub that produces edible roots and leaves, which are used in various traditional cuisines. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, requiring well-drained soil and ample sunlight. Its leaves are rich in nutrients, making them a valuable food source, while the roots are high in carbohydrates.
