    "intro": "Miconia penicillata, commonly known as the pink miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky pubescence. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, attracting various pollinators. Its fruits are small, round berries that turn red when mature, containing seeds dispersed by animals. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in warm climates, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
