    "intro": "Microsorum aurantiacum, commonly known as the Orange-veined Fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bright green fronds with distinct orange veins, which give it its common name. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in the undergrowth of tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize moist soil or substrates effectively. Microsorum aurantiacum is popular in aquatic gardening due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation."
