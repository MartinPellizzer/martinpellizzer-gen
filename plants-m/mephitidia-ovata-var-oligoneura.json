    "intro": "Mephitidia ovata var. oligoneura, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mephitidia, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in width. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pale green to yellow in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in humid conditions. This variant is notable for its distinct leaf morphology and is often mistaken for other similar species due to its subtle floral characteristics."
