    "intro": "Moquinia polymorpha var. ceanothifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf marsh sedge, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and rhizomatous growth habit. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences with three stamens and a single pistil. It thrives in saturated soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical structure supports its role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
