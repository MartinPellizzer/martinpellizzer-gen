    "intro": "Mimosa cerifera, commonly known as the candle bush, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces fluffy, cotton-like seed pods that resemble candles, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in coastal and dry regions. Mimosa cerifera is also known for its sensitive leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait shared with other species in the Mimosa genus."
