    "intro": "Myrmephytum, commonly known as the ant plant, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Rubiaceae. These plants are characterized by their unique ability to secrete a sticky substance that traps ants, which in turn provide nutrients to the plant through their excrement. Myrmephytum species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in shaded, humid environments. The plant's morphology includes small, clustered leaves and small, white or pink flowers. Its symbiotic relationship with ants is a key feature in its ecological niche and botanical significance."
