    "intro": "Muscari neglectum var. valentinum, commonly known as the Valentine's musk grape. This variety is a bulbous perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region, characterized by its clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces a fragrant, musk-like scent, which is particularly noticeable when the flowers are in bloom. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. The foliage consists of strap-like leaves that emerge in early spring, adding visual interest before the flowering period."
