    "intro": "Mariana, commonly known as the Mariana orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Mariana Islands. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without parasitizing them. Due to habitat loss, the Mariana orchid is considered a rare and endangered species."
