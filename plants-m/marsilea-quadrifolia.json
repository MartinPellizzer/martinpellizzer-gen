    "intro": "Marsilea quadrifolia, commonly known as water clover, is a small aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its four-leaf clover-like appearance, with four small, heart-shaped leaves arranged around a central stem. This plant thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its floating leaves are often covered in a waxy coating that helps repel water, while its roots anchor it to the substrate. Marsilea quadrifolia plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
