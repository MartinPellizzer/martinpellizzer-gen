    "intro": "Mimosa didyma, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Mimosa didyma is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and delicate appearance."
