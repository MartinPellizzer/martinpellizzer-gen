    "intro": "Munnozia silphioides, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as desert plains and rocky soils. The plant features a basal rosette of gray-green, woolly leaves and produces tall, slender flowering stems with showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Munnozia silphioides is adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperatures, making it a resilient species in harsh desert conditions."
