    "intro": "Montia bracteosa, commonly known as the bract-leaved montia, is a small, herbaceous annual plant native to western North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant features alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy and have a bluish-green hue. Its small, white flowers are clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences, and it produces small, elliptical seeds enclosed in a capsule. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
