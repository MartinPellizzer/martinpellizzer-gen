It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, water-storing leaves and showy, daisy-like flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Mesembryanthemum aloides is popular as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant flowers and low maintenance requirements."
