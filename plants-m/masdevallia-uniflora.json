    "intro": "Masdevallia uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower masdevallia, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and elongated, often pendulous inflorescence. The plant typically produces a single, showy flower per stem, which is usually brightly colored with intricate patterns. Its foliage consists of narrow, strap-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette formation. Masdevallia uniflora thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
