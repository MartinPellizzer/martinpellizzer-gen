    "intro": "Medicago \u00d7 tianschanica var. rivularis, commonly known as the river medick, is a perennial legume native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found along riverbanks and wet meadows. It plays a role in soil stabilization and nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in riparian habitats."
