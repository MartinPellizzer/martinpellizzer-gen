It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it remains relatively rare in horticultural trade."
