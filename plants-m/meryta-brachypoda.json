    "intro": "Meryta brachypoda, commonly known as the short-stemmed meryta, is a shrub native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries. It thrives in coastal and lowland forest environments, often growing in shaded, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
