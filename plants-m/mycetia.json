    "intro": "Mycetia, commonly known as the \"false indigo\" or \"Indian hibiscus,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Mycetia species are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their palmate leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. They produce capsule fruits containing numerous seeds, and many species have been used in traditional medicine. The genus is also notable for its ability to thrive in poor soils, making it an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
