It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, and it has palmate leaves with a velvety texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
