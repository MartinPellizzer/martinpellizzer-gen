    "intro": "Myosotis pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf forget-me-not, is a small, herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters, with delicate blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine pubescence. Its flowers are arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Myosotis pusilla is often found in moist meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
