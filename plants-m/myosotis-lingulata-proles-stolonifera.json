    "intro": "Myosotis lingulata proles stolonifera, commonly known as the stoloniferous forget-me-not, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that produce small, blue or violet flowers with five petals. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors or stream banks. Its stolons allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that can colonize suitable habitats effectively."
