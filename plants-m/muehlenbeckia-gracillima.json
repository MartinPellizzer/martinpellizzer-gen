    "intro": "Muehlenbeckia gracillima, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to New Zealand. It features slender, creeping stems that form dense mats, often covered in fine, silvery hairs that give it its common name. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a soft, velvety texture. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. This plant is well adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest margins and stream banks."
