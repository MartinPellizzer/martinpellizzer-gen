    "intro": "Microlicia leucantha var. purpurea, commonly known as the purple-flowered microlicia, is a rare and striking member of the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and showy, lavender-pink flowers that bloom in clusters. Native to specific regions of South America, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its varietal name, *purpurea*, refers to the distinctive purplish hue of its floral bracts. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
