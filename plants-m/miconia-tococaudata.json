    "intro": "Miconia tococaudata, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into bright red, fleshy fruits resembling starfruits. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it an invasive species in some regions. The plant's botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially problematic in non-native habitats."
