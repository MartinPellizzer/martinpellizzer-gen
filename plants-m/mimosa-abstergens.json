    "intro": "Mimosa abstergens, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a tropical shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that rapidly fold when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. Its botanical name, *Mimosa abstergens*, refers to its ability to \"clean\" or \"remove\" itself from stimuli, a trait linked to its sensitive leaf movements. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
