    "intro": "Miconia theaezans var. glaberrima, commonly known as the glabrous miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the Melastomataceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, where it thrives in humid, lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to several meters in height. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
