    "intro": "Monogramma robusta, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Its leaves are typically divided into small, serrated segments, giving it a distinctive appearance. Monogramma robusta is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in shady areas."
