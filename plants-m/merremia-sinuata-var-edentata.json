    "intro": "Merremia sinuata var. edentata, commonly known as the Florida morning glory, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves with a distinctive wavy margin. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
