    "intro": "Medicago denticulata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed clover, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun. Medicago denticulata is often used in forage and as a cover crop due to its hardiness and nutritional value."
