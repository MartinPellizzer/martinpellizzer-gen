    "intro": "Magnolia obovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf magnolia, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The leaves are elliptical in shape, with a smooth texture and a dark green upper surface. The tree produces small, round fruits that contain winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal. It is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
