    "intro": "Marsdenia haitiensis, commonly known as the Haitian Marsdenia, is a climbing vine native to the Caribbean, particularly Haiti. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, white, tubular flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a follicle that contains several elliptical seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
