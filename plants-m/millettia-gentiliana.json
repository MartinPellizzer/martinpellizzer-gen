    "intro": "Millettia gentiliana, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and compound leaves. The tree produces hard, dark wood that is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered in many regions."
