    "intro": "Mikania platylepis, commonly known as the broad-leaved mikania, is a climbing vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, broad leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by fluffy, seed-bearing structures. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it can become a problematic weed in some areas."
