    "intro": "Monnina arenicola, commonly known as sand mallow, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, hairy stems, and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Its leaves are typically oval or lance-shaped, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss. Monnina arenicola plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
