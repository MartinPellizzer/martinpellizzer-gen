    "intro": "Medicago romanica var. ergenensis, commonly known as the Ergenens Medick, is a variant of the common medick, characterized by its distinctive botanical features. It is a low-growing perennial herb with trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its morphology includes a compact growth habit with hairy stems and stipitate leaves, which aid in its adaptation to arid environments. The species is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinator populations."
