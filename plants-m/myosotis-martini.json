    "intro": "Myosotis martini, commonly known as the alpine forget-me-not, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, fuzzy coating, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. Myosotis martini is often found in meadows and slopes at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
