It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbrella-like inflorescence. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and scrub habitats. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
