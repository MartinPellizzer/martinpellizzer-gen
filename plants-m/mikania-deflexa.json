    "intro": "Mikania deflexa, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a vigorous climbing vine native to the Americas. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating and produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats, often invading disturbed areas. Its stems are covered in fine hairs and can twine around other plants or structures. Mikania deflexa is often considered a weed due to its aggressive spreading habit and ecological impact."
