    "intro": "Metathelypteris deltoideofrons, commonly known as the deltoid-fronded water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, deltoid-shaped fronds that are often deeply lobed and divided into narrow segments. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as swampy areas and along riverbanks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in moist soil, while its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat."
