    "intro": "Malvastrum tricuspidatum var. bicuspidatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southern United States. It features palmately lobed leaves with three to five deep divisions, giving it a distinctive, fern-like appearance. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots and hairy stems are characteristic of the Malvaceae family, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats."
