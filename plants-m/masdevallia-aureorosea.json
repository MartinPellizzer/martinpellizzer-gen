    "intro": "Masdevallia aureorosea, commonly known as the golden rose masdevallia, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant orange and rose-colored petals, which give it its striking appearance. The plant typically grows as a small epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are short-lived but highly ornamental, often appearing in clusters during the spring and summer months. Masdevallia aureorosea requires specific care, including high humidity and indirect light, to thrive in cultivation."
