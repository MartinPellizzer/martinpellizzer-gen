    "intro": "Modesta, commonly known as the modesta orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, meaning it forms new shoots from the base of the previous growth. Its leaves are elliptical and arranged in a fan-like pattern, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Modesta thrives in humid, well-drained soil and requires indirect sunlight for optimal growth."
