    "intro": "Michelia macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited michelia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern China. It is characterized by its fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces large, woody capsules that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a smooth, dark green upper surface. Michelia macrocarpa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is often cultivated in gardens and parks."
