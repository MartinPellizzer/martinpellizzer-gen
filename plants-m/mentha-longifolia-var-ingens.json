    "intro": "Mentha longifolia var. ingens, commonly known as the giant hedge mint, is a variant of the hedge mint species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, making it one of the tallest members of the mint family. The leaves are lance-shaped, serrated, and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are small, pinkish-white, and clustered in whorls along the stem. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in dry grasslands and rocky areas. This plant is valued for its aromatic leaves and has been used historically in herbal medicine and as a culinary herb."
