    "intro": "Mimulus geniculatus, commonly known as the yellow monkeyflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of South America. It is characterized by its bright yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats such as streambanks and meadows. It has heart-shaped leaves and a distinctive, spurred petal structure that aids in pollination by insects. Mimulus geniculatus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
