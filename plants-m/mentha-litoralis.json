    "intro": "Mentha litoralis, commonly known as sea mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Mentha litoralis thrives in moist, saline soils along shorelines and is often found in salt marshes and tidal areas. Its essential oils contain menthol and other compounds that contribute to its distinctive minty aroma and medicinal properties."
