    "intro": "Microsorum longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, elongated, and lance-shaped fronds that are typically 15\u201330 cm in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and streams. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the substrate, helping to stabilize the sediment. The fronds are usually bright green and can be used in ornamental aquatic gardens."
