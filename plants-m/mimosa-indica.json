    "intro": "Mimosa indica, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that rapidly fold when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by elongated, bean-like pods. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Mimosa indica is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and adaptability to various climates."
