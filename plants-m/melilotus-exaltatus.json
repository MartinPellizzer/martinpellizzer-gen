It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, often branching towards the upper part. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, trifoliate, and have a mild, sometimes sweet scent. Melilotus exaltatus is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields."
