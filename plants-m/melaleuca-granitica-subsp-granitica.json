    "intro": "Melaleuca granitica subsp. granitica, commonly known as the granite melaleuca, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes. Its bark is typically rough and fissured, and it produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal environments and providing habitat for native wildlife."
