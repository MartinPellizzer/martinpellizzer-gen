    "intro": "Milium villosum, commonly known as hairy millet, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant features slender, wiry stems covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-gray hue due to the presence of trichomes. Milium villosum is often cultivated as a ornamental plant for its delicate, fluffy seed heads that add visual interest to gardens."
