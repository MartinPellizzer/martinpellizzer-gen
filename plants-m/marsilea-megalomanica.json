    "intro": "Marsilea megalomanica, commonly known as the giant water clover, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its floating leaves that are divided into four lobes, resembling a clover leaf. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically submerged, followed by the development of dark, flat, floating fruits. Marsilea megalomanica is often found in nutrient-rich waters and can form dense mats on the water surface."
