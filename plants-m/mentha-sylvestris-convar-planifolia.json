It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils that contribute to its distinctive menthol scent. This variety is often used in herbal teas and traditional medicine for its cooling and digestive properties."
