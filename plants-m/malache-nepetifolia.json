    "intro": "Malache nepetifolia, commonly known as the creeping marshweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It features slender, often prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly across moist soils. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and have a slightly rough texture. Malache nepetifolia is often found in shallow water or saturated soil, making it an important component of aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems."
