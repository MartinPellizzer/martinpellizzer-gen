It is characterized by its vivid red and purple flowers, which are often adorned with intricate patterns resembling veins or blood vessels. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often within the understory of tropical forests. Its roots are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to aid in nutrient absorption. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is highly valued in botanical collections and conservation efforts."
