    "intro": "Mapania andamanica, commonly known as the Andaman mountain vine, is a climbing plant native to the Andaman Islands. It belongs to the family Menispermaceae and is characterized by its twining stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, woody fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
