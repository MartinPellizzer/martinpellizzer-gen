    "intro": "Microthelys, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the orchid family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying solely on its roots for nutrients. The plant produces delicate, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. Microthelys thrives in specific, moist, and shaded environments such as pine rocklands. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
