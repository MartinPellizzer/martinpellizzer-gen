    "intro": "Manihot incisa, commonly known as the arrowleaf batata, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its broad, arrow-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that develop into oval, edible tubers. These tubers are rich in starch and have been used as a food source by indigenous communities. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
