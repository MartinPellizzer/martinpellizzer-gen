    "intro": "Mandragora vernalis, commonly known as spring mandrake, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its distinctive, often lobed leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that contain toxic alkaloids, making it both a botanical curiosity and a plant with significant historical and medicinal importance. Its roots, which are thick and often branched, have been traditionally used in folk medicine, though they are highly poisonous and should never be consumed without expert guidance."
