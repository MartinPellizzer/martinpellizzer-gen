    "intro": "Mespilus coccinea, commonly known as the red medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its smooth, grey-barked trunk and oval-shaped leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in spring, followed by unique, fleshy fruits that ripen in late autumn. These fruits, known as medlars, are typically covered in a woolly coating and require a process called \"maceration\" to become edible. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
