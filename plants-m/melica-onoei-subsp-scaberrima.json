    "intro": "Melica onoei subsp. scaberrima, commonly known as the rough meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, rough-textured leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered at the ends of the stems, with small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, temperate environments, often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of grassland ecosystems."
