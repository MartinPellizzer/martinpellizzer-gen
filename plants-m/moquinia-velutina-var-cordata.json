    "intro": "Moquinia velutina var. cordata, commonly known as the velvetleaf moquinia, is a perennial herb native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are typically dark green with a smooth texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in summer, often in clusters at the base of the leaves. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its adaptability, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
