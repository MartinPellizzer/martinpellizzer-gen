    "intro": "Mesosphaerum halimifolium, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, urn-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has adapted to saline and sandy soils, making it well-suited for coastal environments. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize dunes."
