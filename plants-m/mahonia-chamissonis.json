It features compound leaves with a serrated edge and a deep green color, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by blue-black berries that are edible but have a tart flavor. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in partial shade. Mahonia chamissonis is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
