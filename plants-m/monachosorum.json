It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, pale blue or white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid environments. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Monachosorum is considered a rare and endangered species."
