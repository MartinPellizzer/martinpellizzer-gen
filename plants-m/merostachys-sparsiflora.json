It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are typically arranged in a loose, open cluster. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas. Merostachys sparsiflora plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
