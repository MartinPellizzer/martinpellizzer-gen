    "intro": "Marsilea drummondii var. salvatrix, commonly known as the water clover, is a small aquatic fern that thrives in shallow, freshwater environments. It has four small, heart-shaped leaves that resemble a clover, and it produces tiny, floating spores for reproduction. The plant is native to North America and is often found in ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, allowing it to colonize new areas efficiently. It plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
