    "intro": "Medicago polymorpha var. recta, commonly known as the straightleaf sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves with a distinctive straight leaflet arrangement. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by narrow, elongated pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in forage and soil stabilization due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological and agricultural contexts."
