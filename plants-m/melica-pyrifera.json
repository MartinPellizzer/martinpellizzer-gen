    "intro": "Melica pyrifera, commonly known as the fireleaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive reddish or bronze coloration, especially along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Melica pyrifera thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and potential horticultural use."
