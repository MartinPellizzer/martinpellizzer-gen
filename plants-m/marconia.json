    "intro": "Marconia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and striking, white, orchid-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in specific wetland habitats, often growing on the trunks of cypress trees. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered. Botanically, it belongs to the genus Dendrophylax and is classified as a terrestrial orchid with unique adaptations for survival in its niche environment."
