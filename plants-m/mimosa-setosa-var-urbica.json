    "intro": "Mimosa setosa var. urbica, commonly known as the urban mimosa, is a low-growing shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are typically pink to reddish in color, and it produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that appear in late spring. The plant is adapted to urban environments, thriving in disturbed soils and partial shade. It has a shallow root system, making it susceptible to drought but resilient in compacted soils. Its botanical characteristics make it a hardy, ornamental plant often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and ability to tolerate urban conditions."
