    "intro": "Matelea lhotzkyana, commonly known as the Mexican moonflower, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night. The plant is a climbing vine with heart-shaped leaves and produces fragrant blooms that attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its flowers typically open in the evening and close by morning, a trait that aids in its pollination strategy. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
