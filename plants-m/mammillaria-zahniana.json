It is characterized by its dense, white spines and a compact, rounded shape. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and desert gardens."
