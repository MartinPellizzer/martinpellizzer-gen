    "intro": "Myosotis macrosperma, commonly known as the large-seeded forget-me-not, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors. Myosotis macrosperma is part of the Boraginaceae family, which is known for its showy flowers and medicinal properties. Its seeds are large and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural distribution across its native habitat."
