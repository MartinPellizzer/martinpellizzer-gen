    "intro": "Melandrium lapponicum, commonly known as the Lapland catchfly, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It has small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its botanical features make it a characteristic component of tundra and rocky habitats."
