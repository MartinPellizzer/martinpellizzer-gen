    "intro": "Mimosa microcephala var. communis, commonly known as the small-headed sensitive plant, is a species native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in temperature or light. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Its rapid growth and unique movement make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
