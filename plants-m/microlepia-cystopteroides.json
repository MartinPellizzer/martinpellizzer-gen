    "intro": "Microlepia cystopteroides, commonly known as the small shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce both sterile and fertile fronds. Its spores are released from small, round sorus clusters located on the underside of the leaves. This fern is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices."
