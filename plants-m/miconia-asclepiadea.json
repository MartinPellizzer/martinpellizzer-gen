    "intro": "Miconia asclepiadea, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by distinctive, round, red berries. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
