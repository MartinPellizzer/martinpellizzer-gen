    "intro": "Mcneillia, commonly known as the silver leaf plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plants typically have silvery-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Mcneillia species are often shrubs or subshrubs, with small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the spring. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in landscaping."
