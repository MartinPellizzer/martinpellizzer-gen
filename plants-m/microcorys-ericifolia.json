    "intro": "Microcorys ericifolia, commonly known as the heath microcorys, is a low-growing shrub native to the western coast of North America. It typically thrives in moist, acidic soils found in coastal heathlands and rocky areas. The plant features small, needle-like leaves that are densely packed, giving it a cushion-like appearance. Its flowers are inconspicuous, usually greenish-white, and appear in clusters at the base of the stems. Microcorys ericifolia plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
