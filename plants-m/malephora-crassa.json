    "intro": "Malephora crassa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is a lithophyte, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, often in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a distinctive appearance with long, slender stems and clusters of pale green or white flowers. Its unique growth habit and limited distribution make it a subject of botanical interest. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is also considered endangered."
