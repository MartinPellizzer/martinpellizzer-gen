    "intro": "Myrmecodia paucispina, commonly known as the ant plant, is a unique epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its swollen, tree-like stems that form a dense, spongy structure. The plant hosts colonies of ants within its hollow stems, providing them with shelter and food in exchange for protection against herbivores. Its leaves are small, opposite, and often covered with a waxy cuticle. Myrmecodia paucispina is adapted to grow in shaded, humid environments, typically on the trunks of trees in tropical rainforests."
