    "intro": "Maytenus sidamoensis, commonly known as the Sidamo mayten, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Ethiopia. It belongs to the family Celastraceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by small, spherical fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in the understory of humid forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
