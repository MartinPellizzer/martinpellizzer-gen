    "intro": "Mimosa microcephala var. lumaria, commonly known as the silver mimosa, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, fern-like leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in response to touch, a trait known as thigmonasty. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in sandy or rocky coastal environments. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
