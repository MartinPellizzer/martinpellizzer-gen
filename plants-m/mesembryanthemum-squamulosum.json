It features fleshy, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically yellow or orange, blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a distinctive addition to succulent collections."
