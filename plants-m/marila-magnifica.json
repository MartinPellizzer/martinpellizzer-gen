    "intro": "Marila magnifica, commonly known as the magnificent marila, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, velvety leaves that can grow up to 3 feet in length, which are often a deep green with a glossy sheen. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in clusters during the warm season. Its growth habit is typically vine-like, requiring support as it climbs towards the canopy. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
