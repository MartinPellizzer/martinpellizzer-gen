    "intro": "Metrosideros colensoi var. pendens, commonly known as the hanging flame tree, is a unique variant of the native New Zealand pohutukawa. It is characterized by its pendulous, weeping growth habit, with branches drooping gracefully from the main trunk. The plant produces striking red flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered in dense, showy inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, providing a contrasting green backdrop to the vibrant blooms. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to coastal and sunny environments."
