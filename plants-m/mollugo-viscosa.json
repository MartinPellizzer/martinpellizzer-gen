    "intro": "Mollugo viscosa, commonly known as stickyweed or bladderworts, is a small, herbaceous plant native to Europe, Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, often hairy stems and small, alternate leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant produces tiny, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in wet meadows. Mollugo viscosa is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction."
