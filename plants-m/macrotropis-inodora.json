    "intro": "Macrotropis inodora, commonly known as the sweet flag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in the southeastern United States. It has long, narrow leaves that are typically grass-like in appearance, and it produces small, fragrant, white to greenish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist soils. Its aromatic properties have historically been used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent. Macrotropis inodora plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
