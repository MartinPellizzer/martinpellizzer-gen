    "intro": "Mammillaria collinsii, commonly known as the Collins' nipple cactus, is a small, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a dense covering of white to pale green tubercles, which give it a distinctive, spiny appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of 5 to 10 centimeters and has a compact, rounded shape. Its flowers, which are usually yellow or orange, bloom in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
