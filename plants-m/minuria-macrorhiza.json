    "intro": "Minuria macrorhiza, commonly known as the large-rooted minuria, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its fibrous, extensively branched root system, which is a key feature of its botanical description. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
