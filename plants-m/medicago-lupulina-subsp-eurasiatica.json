    "intro": "Medicago lupulina subsp. eurasiatica, commonly known as the Eurasian sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to temperate regions of Eurasia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant features trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces yellow flowers in racemes. Its seeds are small and encased in a hairy pod, which aids in wind dispersal. As a nitrogen-fixing plant, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
