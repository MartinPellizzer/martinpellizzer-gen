    "intro": "Manulea campanulata, commonly known as the bellflower of the highlands, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats at elevations above 2,000 meters. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
