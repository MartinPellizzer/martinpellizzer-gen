    "intro": "Mikania michelangeliana, commonly known as the Michelangelo's morning glory, is a climbing vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its rapid growth and heart-shaped, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple, blooming in the morning and closing by midday. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain areas."
