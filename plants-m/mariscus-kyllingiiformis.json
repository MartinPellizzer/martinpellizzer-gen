    "intro": "Mariscus kyllingiiformis, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking, blue-violet flower heads that resemble small, compact clusters of flowers. The plant has silver-gray foliage with a waxy texture, adapted to thrive in salty, windy environments. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Mariscus kyllingiiformis is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
