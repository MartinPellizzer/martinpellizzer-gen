    "intro": "Mimulus punctatus, commonly known as the spotted monkeyflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its vibrant orange to yellow flowers, which are typically spurred at the back, a feature common in the genus Mimulus. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in streambanks and meadows. Mimulus punctatus is an important plant for pollinators such as bees and butterflies due to its nectar-rich flowers."
