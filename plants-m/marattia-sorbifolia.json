    "intro": "Marattia sorbifolia, commonly known as the sorb tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Marattiaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant exhibits a unique growth pattern, with a creeping rhizome that produces both roots and new shoots. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
