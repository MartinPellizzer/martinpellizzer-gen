    "intro": "Marlierea pudica, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa, is a herbaceous annual plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimuli. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with small yellow flowers that appear in clusters. Its leaves are opposite and pinnately compound, consisting of numerous small leaflets. Marlierea pudica thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and botanical collections."
