    "intro": "Machaerium erianthum, commonly known as the velvetleaf or silky machaerium, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences bearing white to pale yellow flowers, which are often accompanied by bracts. Its seeds are encased in small, hairy pods that split open when mature. Machaerium erianthum is adapted to thrive in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural areas, where it can become a weed."
