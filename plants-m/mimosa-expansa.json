    "intro": "Mimosa expansa, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are arranged in clusters. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in open woodlands or disturbed soils. Its unique response to touch is due to the rapid movement of water in its leaf cells."
