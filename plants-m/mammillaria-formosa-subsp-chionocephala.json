It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a striking contrast to its gray-green foliage. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
