    "intro": "Myrica integrifolia, commonly known as the wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, waxy leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Myrica integrifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate wet conditions."
