    "intro": "Mahonia fargesii, commonly known as the Chinese mahonia, is a shrub native to China. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with leathery, dark green leaves that have a distinctive, spiny margin. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in upright panicles. These flowers are followed by blue-black berries that are edible for birds but generally not for humans. Mahonia fargesii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
