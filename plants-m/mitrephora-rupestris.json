It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows in rocky or mountainous terrain. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are often white or pale yellow, which attract pollinators. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
