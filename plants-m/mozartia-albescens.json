    "intro": "Mozartia albescens, commonly known as the white-haired grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white coating. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
