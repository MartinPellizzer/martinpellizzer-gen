    "intro": "Mentha subspicata var. fluviatilis, commonly known as water mint, is a variant of the mint genus native to wetland and riparian habitats. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers arranged in whorls along the stem, typical of the mint family. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, giving it a strong, menthol-like scent. This variety is often used in traditional herbal remedies and as a culinary herb, though it is less commonly cultivated than other mint species."
