    "intro": "Melilotus melilotus-italicus, commonly known as sweet clover, is a biennial or perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in loose, spherical clusters. The plant contains volatile oils and coumarin, which contribute to its sweet scent and medicinal properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed sites. Sweet clover is also used in agriculture as a forage crop and in soil preparation due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities."
