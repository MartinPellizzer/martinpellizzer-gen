    "intro": "Micromeria thymoides subsp. cacuminicolae, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, aromatic, gray-green leaves and clusters of pink or red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in sandy soils. It has small, glandular hairs on its leaves that reduce water loss and deter herbivores. This subspecies is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
