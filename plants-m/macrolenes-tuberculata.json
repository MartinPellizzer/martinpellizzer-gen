It features distinctive, tuberculate (knobbed) stems that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a waxy texture. Macrolenes tuberculata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
