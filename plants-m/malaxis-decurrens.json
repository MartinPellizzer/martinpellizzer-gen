    "intro": "Malaxis decurrens, commonly known as the ascending malaxis, is a terrestrial orchid native to regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and linear, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single, racemose inflorescence bearing small, greenish-white flowers with prominent lip petals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
