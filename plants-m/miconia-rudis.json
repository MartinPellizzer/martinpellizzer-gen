It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. Miconia rudis is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive spread and ecological impact."
