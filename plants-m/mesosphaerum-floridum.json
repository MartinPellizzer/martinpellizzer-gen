It is a herbaceous species characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clusters of tiny, white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetland habitats. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an important subject for botanical study. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
