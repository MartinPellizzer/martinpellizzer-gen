    "intro": "Miconia adrienii, commonly known as the Adrien's miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the Melastomataceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. It often grows in moist, shaded environments within dense tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions, though it can become invasive in some areas."
