    "intro": "Morus trianae, commonly known as the Trianas mulberry, is a species of mulberry native to the Caribbean and northern South America. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and broad, lobed leaves. The leaves are typically alternate, with a rough texture and a serrated margin. It produces small, aggregate fruits known as mulberries, which are edible and have a sweet, juicy flavor. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in local ecosystems."
