    "intro": "Mimosa polyacantha, commonly known as the sensitive plant or velvetleaf, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its woody stems are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. Mimosa polyacantha is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of light conditions."
