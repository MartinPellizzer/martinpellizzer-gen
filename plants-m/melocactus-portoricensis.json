    "intro": "Melocactus portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican melon cactus, is a species native to the island of Puerto Rico. It is a small, columnar cactus with a distinctive green body and a spiny, helmet-like structure at the top. The plant is characterized by its dense, woolly covering and short, hooked spines. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to the dry, rocky habitats of its native environment. Melocactus portoricensis is also known for its ability to store water in its thick stem, which helps it survive in arid conditions."
