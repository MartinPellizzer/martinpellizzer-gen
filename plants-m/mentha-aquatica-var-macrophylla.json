    "intro": "Mentha aquatica var. macrophylla, commonly known as water mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, broadly lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly toothed. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its aromatic leaves and stems contain essential oils, contributing to its use in herbal teas and traditional medicine. Water mint thrives in wet soils near streams, ponds, and damp woodlands, making it a common sight in riparian habitats."
