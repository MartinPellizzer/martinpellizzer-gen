    "intro": "Melica armena, commonly known as Armenian grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Melica armena is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
