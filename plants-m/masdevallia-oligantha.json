    "intro": "Masdevallia oligantha, commonly known as the pink masdevallia, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from pink to white. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. Masdevallia oligantha is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and ease of cultivation in cool, high-light conditions."
