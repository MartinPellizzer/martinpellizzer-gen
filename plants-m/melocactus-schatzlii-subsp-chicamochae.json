    "intro": "Melocactus schatzlii subsp. chicamochae, commonly known as the Chicamochae melocactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the Andean regions of Bolivia. It features a compact, globular stem that is typically green to reddish in color, covered with a dense layer of white, waxy hair. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are often followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
