    "intro": "Mascagnia macroptera var. flabellariicarpa, commonly known as the fan-fruit or flabellariicarpa mescal bean, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a climbing vine with distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces showy, yellowish-orange flowers that give way to elongated, fleshy fruits containing seeds. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role in arid environments. The variety flabellariicarpa is distinguished by its large, fan-shaped fruits, which are a key feature in its identification."
