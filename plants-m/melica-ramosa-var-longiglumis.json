    "intro": "Melica ramosa var. longiglumis, commonly known as the long-glume brome, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and elongated, glabrous leaf blades. The inflorescence consists of a single, elongated spike with spikelets that are often slightly curved. Its flowers are typically wind-pollinated, and the plant produces small, dry, indehiscent fruits called caryopses. This variety is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, where it contributes to soil stabilization and provides habitat for various invertebrates."
