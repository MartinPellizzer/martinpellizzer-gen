    "intro": "Microcarpaea, commonly known as the small-fruited wood sorrel, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Violaceae. It consists of several species that are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plants are characterized by their heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, delicate flowers. Microcarpaea species often thrive in shaded, moist environments such as forests or undergrowth. Their fruit is usually a small, dry capsule that disperses seeds through wind or animals."
