    "intro": "Marsilea vulgaris, commonly known as water clover, is a small aquatic fern that thrives in shallow, still waters. It has four small, heart-shaped leaves that resemble a clover, giving it its common name. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are often submerged, followed by small, round, green fruits. It is widely used in aquascaping and as a water purifier due to its ability to absorb nutrients from the water. Marsilea vulgaris is native to Asia but has been introduced to many regions around the world."
