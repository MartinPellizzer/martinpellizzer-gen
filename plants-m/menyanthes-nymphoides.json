    "intro": "Menyanthes nymphoides, commonly known as the water pimpernel, is a small herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in the Northern Hemisphere. It produces clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water surface. Its roots are adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems. The plant is also known for its aromatic scent, which can be released when the leaves are disturbed."
