It is characterized by its round, slightly hairy leaves that are often wrinkled and have a strong, minty aroma. The plant produces small, pale purple flowers that bloom in summer, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Mentha rotundata is often used in culinary and medicinal applications due to its aromatic properties."
