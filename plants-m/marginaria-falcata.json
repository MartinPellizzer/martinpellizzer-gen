    "intro": "Marginaria falcata, commonly known as the sickleleaf orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, often blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found in forest understories. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
