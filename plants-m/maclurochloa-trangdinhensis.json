    "intro": "Maclurochloa trangdinhensis, commonly known as the Trang Dinh grass, is a rare species of grass native to Vietnam. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories. Its leaves are narrow and have a smooth surface, while its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
