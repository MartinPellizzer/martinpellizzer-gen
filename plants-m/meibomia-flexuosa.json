    "intro": "Meibomia flexuosa, commonly known as the spiral vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its helical twisting stems that allow it to coil around supports as it grows. The leaves are typically alternate, simple, and often have a velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by fruiting bodies that contain small, smooth seeds. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found in forest understories."
