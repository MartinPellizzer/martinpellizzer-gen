    "intro": "Mimosa velloziana var. guaranitica, commonly known as the Brazilian mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by the closing of its stomata. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to various tropical and subtropical environments. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
