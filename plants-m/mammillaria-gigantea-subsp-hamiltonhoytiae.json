    "intro": "Mammillaria gigantea subsp. hamiltonhoytiae, commonly known as the Hamilton Hoyt's mammillaria, is a small, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that help protect it from intense sunlight and moisture loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its stems are typically ribbed and can be green or pale blue in color. This subspecies is prized for its compact size and ornamental appearance, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
