It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with greenish-white flowers, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Melica cupani var. canescens is often found in wetland ecosystems and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for insects."
