    "intro": "Melaleuca cruenta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels off in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters, which bloom in spring and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a leathery texture, and it thrives in well-drained soils in coastal or sandy environments. Melaleuca cruenta is also valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional Aboriginal medicine."
