    "intro": "Malaxis monophyllos f. diphyllos, commonly known as the two-lobed marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring two distinct lobes on the flower's lip, which is a notable botanical trait. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous habitats such as wet meadows and marshes. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, and it blooms during the late spring to early summer. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
