    "intro": "Moehringia frutescens, commonly known as the rock bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a perennial herb with a low, mat-forming growth habit, often found in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Moehringia frutescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
