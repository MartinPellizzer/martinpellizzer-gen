    "intro": "Miconia agyna, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub belonging to the Melastomataceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers with five petals, which are typically arranged in clusters. Its fruit is a small, three-chambered capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Miconia agyna is native to Central and South America and is often found in humid, lowland forests."
