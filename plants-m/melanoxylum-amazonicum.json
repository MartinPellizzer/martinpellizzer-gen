    "intro": "Melanoxylum amazonicum, commonly known as the Amazonian ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark bark and its ability to thrive in humid, nutrient-rich environments. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Due to its hard, durable wood, it has been historically valued for construction and traditional uses."
