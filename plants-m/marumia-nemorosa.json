    "intro": "Marumia nemorosa, commonly known as the forest marumia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 centimeters and features lance-shaped leaves with a glossy, dark green surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, which bloom in clusters during the rainy season. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Marumia nemorosa thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil."
