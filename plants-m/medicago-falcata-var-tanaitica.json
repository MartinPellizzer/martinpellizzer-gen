    "intro": "Medicago falcata var. tanaitica, commonly known as the Tanaisian goat's rue, is a perennial legume native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soil conditions. This variety is of interest in ecological studies due to its resilience and historical use in traditional medicine."
