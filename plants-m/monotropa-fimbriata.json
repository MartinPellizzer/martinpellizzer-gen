    "intro": "Monotropa fimbriata, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a parasitic herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on mycorrhizal fungi to absorb nutrients from the roots of trees. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often remain evergreen throughout the year. It thrives in shaded, moist forest environments and is sometimes called the \"dancing ghost\" due to its ethereal appearance."
