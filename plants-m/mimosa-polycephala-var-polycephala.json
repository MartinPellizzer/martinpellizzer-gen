    "intro": "Mimosa polycephala var. polycephala, commonly known as the silky mimosa, is a shrub native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by light or touch. The plant produces small, yellow, globular flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil, making it useful in erosion control. The plant prefers well-drained soil and full sun, thriving in arid to semi-arid environments."
