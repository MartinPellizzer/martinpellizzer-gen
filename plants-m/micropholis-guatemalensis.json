    "intro": "Micropholis guatemalensis, commonly known as the Guatemalan micropholis, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is a small evergreen shrub native to Central America, particularly found in the cloud forests of Guatemala and neighboring countries. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It produces small, round berries that are typically red when mature, containing one or two seeds. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
