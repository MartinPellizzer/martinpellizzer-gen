    "intro": "Mimosa lentiscifolia, commonly known as the dwarf mimosa, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, fern-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in spring and are followed by small, woody pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant once established. Mimosa lentiscifolia is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in coastal environments."
