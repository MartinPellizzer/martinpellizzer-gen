    "intro": "Macradenia mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the highlands of Mexico. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its star-shaped flowers, which are typically a vibrant combination of red, yellow, and orange. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its arid environment. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Macradenia mexicana is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and limited natural distribution."
