    "intro": "Malacothamnus involucratus, commonly known as the Sierra buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and spikes of small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Malacothamnus involucratus plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in chaparral and woodland ecosystems."
