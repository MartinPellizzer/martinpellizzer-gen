    "intro": "Melica aurantiaca var. rigida, commonly known as rigid orange grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with a reddish or orange hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
