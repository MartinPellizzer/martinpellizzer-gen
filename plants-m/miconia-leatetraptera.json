    "intro": "Miconia leatetraptera, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it can become invasive in certain regions."
