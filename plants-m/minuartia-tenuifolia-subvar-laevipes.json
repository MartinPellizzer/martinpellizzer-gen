    "intro": "Minuartia tenuifolia subvar. laevipes, commonly known as the smoothleaf sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
