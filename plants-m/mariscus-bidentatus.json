    "intro": "Mariscus bidentatus, commonly known as the two-toothed marsh plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant features slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that have two distinct teeth along the margins. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters during the summer months. Mariscus bidentatus plays a vital role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
