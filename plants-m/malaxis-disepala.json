    "intro": "Malaxis disepala, commonly known as the two-lobed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a loose inflorescence, with elongated sepals and petals. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the soil, and it has a short-lived life cycle. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in many regions."
