    "intro": "Melaleuca bracteata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tea tree, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia, particularly Queensland and New South Wales, where it typically grows in coastal heaths and sand dunes. The plant is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in winter. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and has some traditional uses in Indigenous Australian medicine. The tree is also valued for its ability to stabilize coastal soils and its role in ecological restoration projects."
