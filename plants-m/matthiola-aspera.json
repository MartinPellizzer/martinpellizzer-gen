It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cabbages and mustards. The plant is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, four-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a rough texture. Matthiola aspera is often found growing in rocky or disturbed soils, and it is known for its ability to thrive in coastal and arid environments."
