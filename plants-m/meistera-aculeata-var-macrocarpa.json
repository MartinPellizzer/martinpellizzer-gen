It features long, arrow-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 inches in length, making it a dramatic addition to large water features. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding both visual appeal and ecological value. It thrives in slow to moderately fast-moving water with high light intensity and nutrient-rich substrates. Its robust growth and ornamental qualities make it a popular choice for pond and aquarium landscaping."
