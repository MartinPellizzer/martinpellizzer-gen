    "intro": "Minuartia tenuifolia subsp. mediterranea, commonly known as the Mediterranean sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the rocky and sandy soils of southern Europe. It typically features small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are adapted to arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It is often found in coastal areas, cliffs, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
