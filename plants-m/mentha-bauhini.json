    "intro": "Mentha bauhini, commonly known as Indian mint, is a perennial herb native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a serrated edge. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Mentha bauhini is known for its aromatic, menthol-like scent and is often used in traditional medicine for its cooling and digestive properties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight."
