    "intro": "Microseris maritima, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines, adapting to saline and windy conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The showy yellow flowers bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
