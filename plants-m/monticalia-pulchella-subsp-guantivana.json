    "intro": "Monticalia pulchella subsp. guantivana, commonly known as the Guantivana bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the cooler months. The plant is shrub-like, with woody stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
