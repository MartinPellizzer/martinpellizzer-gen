    "intro": "Mimosa nuda var. gracilipes, commonly known as the slender sensitive plant, is a delicate herbaceous species native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warm season. Its slender stems and hairy leaves make it easily distinguishable from other mimosa species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments."
