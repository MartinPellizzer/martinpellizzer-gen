    "intro": "Melilotus officinalis var. vulgaris, commonly known as sweet clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been naturalized in North America. Sweet clover is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a valuable forage crop. It also contains coumarin, which can have anticoagulant effects when consumed in large quantities."
