    "intro": "Morisonia calciphila, commonly known as the limestone lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in calcareous soils, often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to conserve water in its arid environment. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
