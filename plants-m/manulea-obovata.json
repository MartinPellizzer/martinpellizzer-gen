    "intro": "Manulea obovata, commonly known as the broad-ovate manulea, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of eastern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, obovate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, mountainous climates. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
