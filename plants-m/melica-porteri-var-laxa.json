    "intro": "Melica porteri var. laxa, commonly known as the slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, upright stems that are often hairless or sparsely hairy. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a smooth texture. The inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets, which are often held close to the stem."
