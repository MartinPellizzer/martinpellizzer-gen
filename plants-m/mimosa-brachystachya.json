    "intro": "Mimosa brachystachya, commonly known as the small-stemmed sensitive plant, is a species native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in light or touch. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardens and greenhouses. Due to its sensitivity and aesthetic appeal, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
