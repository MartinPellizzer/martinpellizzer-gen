    "intro": "Mimosa chrysastra, commonly known as the golden mimosa, is a deciduous shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by light or physical contact. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a vibrant touch to gardens. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its sensitivity to touch, it is often used in educational settings to demonstrate plant responses."
