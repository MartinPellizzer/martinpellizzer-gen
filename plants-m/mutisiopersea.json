    "intro": "Mutisiopersea, commonly known as the mangrove apple or mangosteen, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces edible, segmented fruits that are rich in antioxidants and have a tart, sweet flavor. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility in coastal areas. Mutisiopersea thrives in brackish water environments, making it an important species in mangrove ecosystems."
