    "intro": "Matthiola glutinosa, commonly known as sticky wallflower, is an annual or biennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its glandular, sticky leaves and showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or disturbed areas. Its sticky foliage helps deter herbivores, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
