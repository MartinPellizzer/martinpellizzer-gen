    "intro": "Misanteca guatemalensis, commonly known as the Guatemalan mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis. Its berries, which are typically red or orange, are an important food source for various bird species. Misanteca guatemalensis plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat, contributing to the food web and potentially influencing the health of its host trees."
