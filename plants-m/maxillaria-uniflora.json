    "intro": "Maxillaria uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces a single, large bloom per stem, which is usually pink or purple in color. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and covered in a fibrous sheath, while its leaves are strap-shaped and arranged in two rows. Maxillaria uniflora thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
