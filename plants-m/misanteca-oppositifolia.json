    "intro": "Misanteca oppositifolia, commonly known as the opposite-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Quercus*. It possesses small, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the health of its host tree if left unchecked."
