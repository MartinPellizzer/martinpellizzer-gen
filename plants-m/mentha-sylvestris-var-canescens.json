    "intro": "Mentha sylvestris var. canescens, commonly known as the gray mint, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, grayish-white pubescence. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers in whorls along the stems, typical of the mint family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or stream banks. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils that contribute to its distinctive minty scent and medicinal properties."
