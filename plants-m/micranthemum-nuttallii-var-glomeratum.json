    "intro": "Micranthemum nuttallii var. glomeratum, commonly known as water wort, is a submerged aquatic plant native to North America. It has small, oval leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length, arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are often submerged, though they may emerge at the water's surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its dense growth helps stabilize sediments and provides habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
