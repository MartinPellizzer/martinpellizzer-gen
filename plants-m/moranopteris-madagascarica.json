It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, thriving in the understory of dense vegetation. Its leaves are often divided into small, lance-shaped segments, and it produces spore-bearing structures called sorus. Moranopteris madagascarica plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to biodiversity and soil stability."
