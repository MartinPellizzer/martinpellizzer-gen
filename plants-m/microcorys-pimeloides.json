    "intro": "Microcorys pimeloides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved microcorys, is a small flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the southern United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, a typical feature of the family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
