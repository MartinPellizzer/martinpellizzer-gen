    "intro": "Miconia auriculata var. quintuplinervia, commonly known as the five-veined miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and northern South America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves with five prominent veins, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a garden plant, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
