    "intro": "Matelea pedalis, commonly known as the Mexican moonflower, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night. The plant is a perennial shrub with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers emit a strong, sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, facilitating its spread in the wild."
