    "intro": "Melica scabrata, commonly known as rough brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, rough-textured leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Melica scabrata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
