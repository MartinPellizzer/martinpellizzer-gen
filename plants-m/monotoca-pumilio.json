It features dense, dark green foliage with a glossy appearance, and its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, usually white or pale yellow, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for garden borders and rock gardens. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and low maintenance requirements."
