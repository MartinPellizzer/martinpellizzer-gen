    "intro": "Monadenium rhizophorum, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its woody stems and dense foliage. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are typically small, narrow, and covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. Monadenium rhizophorum is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it access groundwater."
