    "intro": "Mulgedium petiolatum, commonly known as the slender-stemmed mulgedium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, with slender, elongated stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems, which bloom during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a slightly rough texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Mulgedium petiolatum is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or grassland habitats."
