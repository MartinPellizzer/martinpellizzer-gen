    "intro": "Mallotus intermedius, commonly known as the red-flowered hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy red or pink bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are often overlooked due to the striking bracts. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and full sun. Mallotus intermedius is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
