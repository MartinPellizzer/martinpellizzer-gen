    "intro": "Melanthium cochinchinense, commonly known as the Vietnamese false asphodel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or yellowish in color, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
