    "intro": "Miconia stenobotrys, commonly known as the narrow-leaf miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the Melastomataceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant is often found in moist, shaded forest understories, where it thrives in humid and warm conditions. It produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by birds, contributing to its ecological role in seed dispersal. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other tropical areas, though it can become invasive in some environments."
