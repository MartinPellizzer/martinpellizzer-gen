    "intro": "Maba sericocarpa, commonly known as the silky maba, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that are often fragrant. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds covered in a silky, hairy coating. The botanical features of Maba sericocarpa make it well adapted to its humid, tropical habitat."
