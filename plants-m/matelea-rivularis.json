    "intro": "Matelea rivularis, commonly known as the rivermatelea, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family, which includes milkweeds and other flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and rocky slopes. Its flowers are usually pink to purple and are clustered in umbels, attracting various pollinators. The leaves are opposite and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its often arid habitat."
