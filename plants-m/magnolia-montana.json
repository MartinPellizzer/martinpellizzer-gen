It is characterized by its showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its bark is smooth and gray, often peeling in thin strips. Magnolia montana thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats."
