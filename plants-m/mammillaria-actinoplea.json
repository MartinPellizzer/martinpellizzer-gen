    "intro": "Mammillaria actinoplea, commonly known as the starry mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its globular shape and dense covering of small, white spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
