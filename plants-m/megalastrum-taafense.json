    "intro": "Megalastrum taafense, commonly known as the Taafense starling tree, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat. The bark of Megalastrum taafense contains compounds that have been studied for potential medicinal properties."
