    "intro": "Melodorum micranthum, commonly known as the small-flowered melodia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The flowers typically bloom in spring and are usually pink or red in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and prolonged flowering period."
