    "intro": "Meliosma trichocarpa, commonly known as the silky maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves with a silvery underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. The silky maple is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native habitats."
