    "intro": "Micropsis herteri, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to parts of South America. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a slender, wiry stem with few leaves and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for successful germination. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
