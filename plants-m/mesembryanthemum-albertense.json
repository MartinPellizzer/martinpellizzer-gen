    "intro": "Mesembryanthemum albertense, commonly known as the Albert's ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, characterized by its fleshy leaves and flowers that open in response to light. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow, and white, typically blooming during the cooler months. Its leaves are thick and coated with a waxy layer, helping it retain moisture in arid environments. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its drought tolerance and aesthetic appeal."
