    "intro": "Metastelma paralias, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces showy, violet to pink flowers with five petals, which bloom throughout the year in warm climates. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating to resist salt spray. Metastelma paralias is adapted to saline environments and plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
