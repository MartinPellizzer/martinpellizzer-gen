    "intro": "Micropaegma brachycalyx, commonly known as the short-calyx micropaegma, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elliptical leaves with a smooth surface. Its calyx is notably short and persistent, giving it its scientific name. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
