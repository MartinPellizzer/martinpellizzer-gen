    "intro": "Miconia rubescens, commonly known as the red miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces showy, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in certain regions."
