    "intro": "Mimulus wolfii, commonly known as the yellow monkeyflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its bright yellow, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along streambanks and in open woodlands. It has heart-shaped leaves and produces small, seed-containing capsules after flowering. Mimulus wolfii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
