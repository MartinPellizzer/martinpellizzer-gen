    "intro": "Mormodes jamanxinensis, commonly known as the Jamanxin orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the moist soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
