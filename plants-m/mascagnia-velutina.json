    "intro": "Mascagnia velutina, commonly known as the velvetleaf mescal bean, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, yellow flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds, which are often used in traditional cuisine. Its hairy, velvety leaves give it its common name, and it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Mascagnia velutina is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for ecological restoration projects."
