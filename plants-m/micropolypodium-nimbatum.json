    "intro": "Micropolypodium nimbatum, commonly known as the cloud fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks. The plant has delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern on the underside of the fronds. Micropolypodium nimbatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
