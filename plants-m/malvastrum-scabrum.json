    "intro": "Malvastrum scabrum, commonly known as rough hound's tongue, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny seed pods that resemble a dog's tongue, which are typically green when immature and turn brown as they mature. The plant has hairy, rough-textured leaves that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs. It produces showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Malvastrum scabrum is often found in dry, rocky soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
