    "intro": "Minuartia rostrata, commonly known as the rostrated sandwort, is a low-growing flowering plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is characterized by its small, fleshy, succulent leaves and clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Native to arid and rocky regions of Europe and Asia, this plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. It typically grows on sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous areas. Minuartia rostrata is a perennial species that spreads via rhizomes, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion."
