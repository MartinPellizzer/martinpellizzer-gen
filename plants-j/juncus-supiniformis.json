    "intro": "Juncus supiniformis, commonly known as the prostrate rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It is characterized by its dense clusters of grass-like, cylindrical leaves that grow close to the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in summer, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form thick mats, helping to stabilize soil in wet areas. Juncus supiniformis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to filter water and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
