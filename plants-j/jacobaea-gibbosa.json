    "intro": "Jacobaea gibbosa, commonly known as the rough hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lobed leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. The plant is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its showy, daisy-like blooms. Jacobaea gibbosa typically grows in dry meadows and rocky soils, and it is often found in disturbed or open habitats. It is also noted for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in some areas."
