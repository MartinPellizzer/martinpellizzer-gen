    "intro": "Juncus austerus, commonly known as the tough rush, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist to wet environments such as marshes, wet meadows, and along streambanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often densely clustered at the base, forming a compact rosette. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Juncus austerus plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
