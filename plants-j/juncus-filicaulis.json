    "intro": "Juncus filicaulis, commonly known as the feathered rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features slender, grass-like stems that are often densely clustered, and its leaves are long, narrow, and slightly recurved. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters near the base of the stems, typically in late spring to early summer. Juncus filicaulis thrives in moist to wet soils, making it a common sight in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. Its structure and growth habits make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
