    "intro": "Juncus effusus subsp. solutus, commonly known as the soft rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and moist soils across Europe, Asia, and North America. It features cylindrical, grass-like stems that are often reddish-brown in color and can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of greenish-white flowers in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture that contributes to its ecological importance in stabilizing wetland soils. Juncus effusus subsp. solutus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
