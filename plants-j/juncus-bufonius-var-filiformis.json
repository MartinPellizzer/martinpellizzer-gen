It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered greenish-yellow flowers. This variety is typically found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it thrive in waterlogged soils. It plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
