It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 feet tall, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces striking clusters of tubular, red or orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes in warm climates."
