    "intro": "Jacquinia armillaris var. arborea, commonly known as the tree-like jacquinia, is a rare and unique variant of the Jacquinia genus. It is characterized by its woody stem and branching structure, distinguishing it from the herbaceous forms of its species. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in umbels. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
