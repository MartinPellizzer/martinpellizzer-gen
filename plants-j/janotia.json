    "intro": "Janotia, commonly known as the common wintergreen, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees found in temperate regions. The plants are characterized by their evergreen leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Janotia species typically thrive in acidic soils and are often found in forested areas. They play a role in supporting local wildlife, particularly pollinators like bees and butterflies."
