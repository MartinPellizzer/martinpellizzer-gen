    "intro": "Juncus maritimus, commonly known as salt marsh rush, is a perennial flowering plant native to coastal regions. It thrives in saline and brackish wetlands, often found in tidal marshes and estuaries. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that grow upright, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in coastal areas. Juncus maritimus plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wetland organisms."
