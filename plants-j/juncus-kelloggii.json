    "intro": "Juncus kelloggii, commonly known as the Kellogg's rush, is a perennial flowering plant native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in wetland areas, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of white or pale pink flowers. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water. Juncus kelloggii is also valued for its ornamental appeal in garden settings."
