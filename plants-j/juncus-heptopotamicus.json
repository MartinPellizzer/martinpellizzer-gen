    "intro": "Juncus heptopotamicus, commonly known as the Seven Rivers rush, is a perennial plant native to the wetlands and marshy areas of the seven river valleys in southern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in shades of green or brown. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found near freshwater sources. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
