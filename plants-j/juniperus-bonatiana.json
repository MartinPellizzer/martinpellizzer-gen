    "intro": "Juniperus bonatiana, commonly known as the Corsican juniper, is a species of juniper native to the Mediterranean region. It is a small evergreen shrub or tree that typically grows in rocky or coastal areas. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are edible but have a sharp, aromatic flavor. Its leaves are scale-like and closely pressed to the branches, giving it a dense appearance. Juniperus bonatiana is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in horticulture for its hardy nature and winter interest."
