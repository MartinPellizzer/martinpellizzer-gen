    "intro": "Juniperus occidentalis f. corbetii, commonly known as the Corbet\u2019s juniper, is a rare and distinctive subspecies native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like form and its blue-green foliage, which contrasts with the more common gray-green coloration of other juniper species. The plant produces small, dark-blue to black berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
