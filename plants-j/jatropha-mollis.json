    "intro": "Jatropha mollis, commonly known as the soft jatropha, is a perennial shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, soft-textured leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces capsule fruits containing toxic, orange seeds, which are a key feature in its botanical classification. Jatropha mollis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Its ornamental value is sometimes appreciated in gardens, though caution is advised due to the toxicity of its parts."
