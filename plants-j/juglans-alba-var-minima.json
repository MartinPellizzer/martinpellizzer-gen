    "intro": "Juglans alba var. minima, commonly known as the dwarf white walnut, is a small tree or shrub native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the walnut family, Juglandaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves with 15 to 23 leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by edible nuts enclosed in a thick, husky shell. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
