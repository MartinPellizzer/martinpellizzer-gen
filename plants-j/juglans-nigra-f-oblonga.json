    "intro": "Juglans nigra f. oblonga, commonly known as the oblong black walnut, is a horticultural form of the black walnut tree. It is characterized by its elongated, oblong-shaped nuts, which are typically smaller than those of the typical black walnut. The plant is native to the eastern United States and thrives in well-drained soils. It produces edible nuts encased in a thick, green husk that splits open when mature. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and as a source of high-quality wood."
