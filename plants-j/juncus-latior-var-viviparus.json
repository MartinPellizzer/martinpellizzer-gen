    "intro": "Juncus latior var. viviparus, commonly known as the viviparous rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marsh habitats. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that often grow in dense clusters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear greenish-yellow flowers. One of its notable features is its ability to produce viviparous shoots, which can root and grow into new plants while still attached to the parent. This adaptation aids in its propagation in moist environments."
