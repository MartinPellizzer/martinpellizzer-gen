    "intro": "Juncus effusus elatus, commonly known as the tall soft rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, often forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences composed of numerous tiny greenish-brown flowers. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often covered in a fine layer of white wax. This species is adapted to moist or water-saturated soils and plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
