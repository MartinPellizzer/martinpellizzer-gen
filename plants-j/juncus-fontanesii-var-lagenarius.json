    "intro": "Juncus fontanesii var. lagenarius, commonly known as the bladder sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as along the edges of ponds and in damp meadows. The plant features cylindrical, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that bloom in the summer months. Its unique feature is the presence of bladder-like structures in its inflorescence, which are specialized seed pods. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize wetland soils."
