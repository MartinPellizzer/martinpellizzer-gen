    "intro": "Juncus subarticulatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and pond edges. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often jointed, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually arranged in spike-like clusters at the tips of the stems. Juncus subarticulatus plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
