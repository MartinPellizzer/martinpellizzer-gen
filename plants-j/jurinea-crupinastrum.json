    "intro": "Jurinea crupinastrum, commonly known as the coastal sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing annual herb that thrives in sandy and coastal environments. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Jurinea crupinastrum plays an important role in stabilizing sand dunes and supporting coastal ecosystems."
