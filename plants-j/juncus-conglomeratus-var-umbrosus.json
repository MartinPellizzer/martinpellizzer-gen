    "intro": "Juncus conglomeratus var. umbrosus, commonly known as the shadow rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to moist, shaded environments. It features tall, cylindrical stems that are typically green to reddish in color, often with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets at the tips of its stems, which are usually brown or reddish-brown in hue. It thrives in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp areas with partial to full shade. Its dense growth habit makes it an effective stabilizer of soil in wetland ecosystems."
