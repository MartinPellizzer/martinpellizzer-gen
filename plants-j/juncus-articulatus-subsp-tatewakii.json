It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are segmented, a characteristic feature of the Juncaceae family. Its leaves are grass-like and often form dense clumps, while small, inconspicuous flowers appear in clusters at the tips of the stems. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
