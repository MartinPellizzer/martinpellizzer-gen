    "intro": "Juncus echinocephalus, commonly known as the spiny-headed rush, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. Its root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland habitats. Juncus echinocephalus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions."
