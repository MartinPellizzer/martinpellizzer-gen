    "intro": "Juncus alpinoarticulatus subsp. fuscoater, commonly known as the dark-stemmed rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine and subarctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in mountainous areas, often forming dense clumps. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are usually dark brown to black in color, with a fibrous, grass-like appearance. Its narrow leaves are often reduced to small scales, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters at the tips of the stems. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is often found in tundra and alpine meadows."
