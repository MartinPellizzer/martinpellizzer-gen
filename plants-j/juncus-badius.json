    "intro": "Juncus badius, commonly known as black rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy areas in North America. It features tall, stiff, grass-like stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, often forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters at the tips of the stems, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a reddish or purplish hue, especially at the base. Juncus badius plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and stabilizing wetland soils."
