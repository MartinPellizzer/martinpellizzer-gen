    "intro": "Juniperus utahensis var. cosnino, commonly known as the Cosnino juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage that is typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing the seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. The species is often used in xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
