    "intro": "Juncus rochelianus var. digeneus, commonly known as the Rochel's rush, is a perennial plant native to the wetlands of eastern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in marshy or aquatic environments, often forming dense stands along the edges of ponds and lakes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in saturated soils and its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. This variant is distinguished by its shorter and more compact growth compared to other members of the Juncus genus."
