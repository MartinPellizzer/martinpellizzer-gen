    "intro": "Juncus bulbosus var. uliginosus, commonly known as the sedge bulblet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in marshy areas and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, cylindrical leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in saturated soils."
