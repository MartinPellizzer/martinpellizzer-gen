    "intro": "Juniperus glauca, commonly known as blue juniper, is a species of evergreen conifer native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves that are typically a bluish-green color, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. Juniperus glauca thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in landscaping due to its hardiness and attractive appearance."
