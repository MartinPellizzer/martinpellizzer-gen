    "intro": "Juniperus oxycedrus var. badia, commonly known as the Badian juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or dry landscapes. This variety is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
