It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in dense clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are borne on spikes, typically in late summer. It thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and damp woodlands. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it ecologically valuable in wetland ecosystems."
