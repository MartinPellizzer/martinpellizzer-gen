    "intro": "Juncus glaucus var. effusus, commonly known as the silver rush, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It features slender, grass-like stems covered in a fine layer of white or grayish bloom, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in spike-like inflorescences. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
