It is characterized by its smooth, often hairy stems and alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. Its seeds are encased in a hard, spiny shell and are toxic to humans and animals. Jatropha glandulifera is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in semi-arid conditions."
