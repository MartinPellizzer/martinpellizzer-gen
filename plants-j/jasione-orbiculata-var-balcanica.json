It belongs to the family Brassicaceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and localized species within its native range."
