Its most distinctive feature is the golden-yellow foliage, which remains vibrant throughout the growing season. This ornamental plant is highly valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a topiary. It is relatively low maintenance, tolerating a variety of soil types and climates. The plant produces small blue-black berries that are attractive to birds but not typically consumed by humans."
