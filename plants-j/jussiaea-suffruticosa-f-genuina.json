It features small, waxy, blue to purple flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has dense, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss, making it well adapted to saline and windy coastal environments. Its compact growth habit and salt tolerance make it a popular choice for coastal landscaping. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in challenging maritime conditions."
