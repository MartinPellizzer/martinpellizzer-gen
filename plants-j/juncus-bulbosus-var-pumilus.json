    "intro": "Juncus bulbosus var. pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf bulbous rush, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of white or pale green flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds. Due to its compact size and adaptability, it is a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
