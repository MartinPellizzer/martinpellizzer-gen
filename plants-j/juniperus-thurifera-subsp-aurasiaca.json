    "intro": "Juniperus thurifera subsp. aurasiaca, commonly known as the Himalayan juniper, is a subspecies native to the mountainous regions of Central and South Asia. It is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree, typically growing in high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, scale-like leaves and blue-gray foliage, which are characteristic of many juniper species. Its cones are typically berry-like, containing aromatic seeds that are used in traditional medicine. This subspecies is adapted to harsh, cold climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems."
