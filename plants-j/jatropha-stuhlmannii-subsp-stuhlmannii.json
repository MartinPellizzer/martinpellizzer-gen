    "intro": "Jatropha stuhlmannii subsp. stuhlmannii, commonly known as the Stuhlmann's physic nut, is a shrub native to tropical Africa. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and has compound leaves with three to five elliptical leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by distinctive red, spiny capsules containing toxic seeds. It is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it is not commonly cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
