    "intro": "Justicia mutica, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf false arum, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
