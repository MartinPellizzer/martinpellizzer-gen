    "intro": "Jaundea oddonii, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow and orange flowers, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant features strap-like leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
