    "intro": "Juncus marginatus var. aristulatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems that grow in dense clusters, typically reaching heights of 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in early summer, which are arranged in spikes along the stems. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a white or pale margin, giving it a distinctive appearance. This species is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife."
