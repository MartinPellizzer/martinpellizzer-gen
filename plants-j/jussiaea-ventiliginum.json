    "intro": "Jussiaea ventiliginum, commonly known as the marsh willow or water willow, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland and riparian habitats. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in areas with standing or slow-moving water. Jussiaea ventiliginum plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
