    "intro": "Jasminum arborescens var. montanum, commonly known as the mountain jasmine, is a flowering shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and has a compact, bushy growth habit. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a hedging plant. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its sweet scent and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
