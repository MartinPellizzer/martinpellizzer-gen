    "intro": "Johnia, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Goodeniaceae. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and are adapted to saline environments. They have distinctive blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, and their leaves are often narrow and covered in fine hairs. Johnia species are often used in coastal landscaping due to their hardiness and ornamental value. The genus includes several species, such as Johnia coerulea and Johnia flaccida, which are native to regions like Australia and South Africa."
