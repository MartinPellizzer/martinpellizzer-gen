    "intro": "Jurinea dolomiaea, commonly known as the Dolomiaea's sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Jurinea dolomiaea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
