    "intro": "Justicia neodebilis, commonly known as the pink flame bush, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular pink or red flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their bright color and nectar-rich structure."
