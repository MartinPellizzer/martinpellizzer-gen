    "intro": "Jatropha multiloba, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its branched structure and thick, woody stems. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing toxic seeds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Jatropha multiloba is also known for its latex sap, which is milky and can cause skin irritation."
