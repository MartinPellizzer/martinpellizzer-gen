    "intro": "Juncus acuminatus f. sphaerocephalus, commonly known as the globe sedge, is a compact, clump-forming perennial plant native to wetland habitats. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense, spherical clusters of small, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it well adapted to marshy environments. Its distinctive rounded inflorescence gives it a unique appearance compared to other sedges. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological value and tolerance of waterlogged conditions."
