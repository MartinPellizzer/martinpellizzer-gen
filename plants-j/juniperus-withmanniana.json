    "intro": "Juniperus withmanniana, commonly known as the Withmann's juniper, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring dense, scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and whitish underneath. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are often used in traditional medicine and as a spice. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. The Withmann's juniper is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in mild climates."
