    "intro": "Juniperus communis subsp. alpina, commonly known as the Alpine juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which are typically blue-green in color and have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Juniperus communis subsp. alpina is known for its resilience to harsh environmental conditions, including cold temperatures and poor soil quality."
