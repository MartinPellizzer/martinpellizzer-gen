    "intro": "Juglans mandshurica f. acuta, commonly known as the sharp-lobed black walnut, is a variant of the black walnut tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, sharply toothed leaves and elongated, serrated leaflets. The tree produces large, edible nuts enclosed in a thick, green husk that splits open when mature. Its wood is highly valued for its strength and durability, making it useful in carpentry and furniture-making. This subspecies thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soils."
