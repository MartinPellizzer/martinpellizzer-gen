    "intro": "Jarava frigida var. parvispicula, commonly known as the dwarf silvergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the arid regions of western North America. It features slender, silver-gray leaves and produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are clustered at the ends of its stems. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperature fluctuations. Its compact growth habit and silvery foliage make it a striking ornamental plant in dry landscapes. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert creatures."
