    "intro": "Juncus husnotii, commonly known as the narrowleaf rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist environments such as wetlands, stream banks, and marshes. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 1 inch in width.

Juncus husnotii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
