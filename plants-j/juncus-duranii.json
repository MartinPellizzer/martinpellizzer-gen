    "intro": "Juncus duranii, commonly known as the Duran's rush, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Juncaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and cylindrical flower spikes. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its flowering period occurs during the summer months, producing small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered at the tips of the stems. Juncus duranii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in harsh environments."
