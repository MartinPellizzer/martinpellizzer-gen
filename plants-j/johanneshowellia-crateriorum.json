    "intro": "Johanneshowellia crateriorum, commonly known as the crater rockcress, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with small, cruciform flowers. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a cool, humid environment to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Johanneshowellia crateriorum is considered a vulnerable species."
