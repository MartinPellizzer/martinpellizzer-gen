    "intro": "Juncus erectus, commonly known as the upright rush, is a perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and grow in dense clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes, usually blooming in late spring to early summer. Juncus erectus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water. Its rhizomes help it spread and form dense vegetation, which provides habitat for various wildlife species."
