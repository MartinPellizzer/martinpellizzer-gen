    "intro": "Justicia elegantula var. repens, commonly known as creeping justicia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and slightly hairy, with a pointed tip. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks."
