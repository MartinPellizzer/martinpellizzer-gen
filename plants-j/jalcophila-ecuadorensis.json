It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its herbaceous growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
