    "intro": "Jacquemontia fusca f. glabrior, commonly known as the smooth jacquemontia, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves, though the 'glabrior' form exhibits a smoother texture compared to the typical variety. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is native to the southeastern United States, where it thrives in moist, woodland habitats. This variant is often found in shaded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
