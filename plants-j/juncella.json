    "intro": "Juncella, commonly known as the spike-rush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Juncaginaceae. These plants are typically found in wet or marshy environments, where they thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Juncella species are characterized by their grass-like appearance, with narrow, cylindrical leaves and small, clustered flowers. They often form dense mats or colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland ecosystems. The genus includes several species, each adapted to different aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats."
