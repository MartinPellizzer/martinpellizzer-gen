    "intro": "Juncus hochstetteri, commonly known as Hochstetter's rush, is a perennial plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Juncaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage composed of narrow, cylindrical leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often forming dense clumps near water sources. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like clusters of white or pale green flowers, which appear in late summer to early autumn. Hochstetter's rush is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
