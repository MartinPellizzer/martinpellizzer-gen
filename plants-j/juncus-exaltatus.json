It features tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense clumps. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bright green and slightly hairy. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters at the top of the stems, which are wind-pollinated.
