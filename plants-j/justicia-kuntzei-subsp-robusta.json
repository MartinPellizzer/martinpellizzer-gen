    "intro": "Justicia kuntzei subsp. robusta, commonly known as the red-rooted false arum, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of the Caribbean. It is characterized by its striking, spatulate-shaped leaves and clusters of bright red, lantern-like bracts that resemble a false arum. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are often hidden beneath the colorful bracts. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its vibrant appearance."
