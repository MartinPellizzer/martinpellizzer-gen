    "intro": "Juniperus tetragona, commonly known as the four-cornered juniper, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive four-angled branches and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces blue-black berries that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Juniperus tetragona is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its aromatic wood and resilience in harsh climates."
