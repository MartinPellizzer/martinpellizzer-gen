    "intro": "Jambosa hardwickia, commonly known as the hardwickia tree, is a deciduous leguminous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate with 7 to 15 leaflets, and its distinctive yellowish or reddish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces elongated pods containing flat, kidney-shaped seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Jambosa hardwickia is also valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a source of browse for livestock."
