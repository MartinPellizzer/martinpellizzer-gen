    "intro": "Junellia struthionum, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with a robust root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. The plant features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a subtle purple or red tinge. Its leaves are typically narrow and succulent, adapted to minimize water loss. Junellia struthionum plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and provides nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
