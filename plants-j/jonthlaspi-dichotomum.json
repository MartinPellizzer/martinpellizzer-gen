It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops like cabbage and mustard. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are alternate and often lobed. Jonthlaspi dichotomum is often considered a weed but has some historical use in traditional medicine."
