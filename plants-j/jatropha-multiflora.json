It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow fruits that contain toxic seeds, which are not suitable for human consumption. Jatropha multiflora is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and potential biofuel research."
