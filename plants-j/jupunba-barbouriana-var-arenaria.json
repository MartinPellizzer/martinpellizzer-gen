    "intro": "Jupunba barbouriana var. arenaria, commonly known as the sand dune buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low, mat-forming growth habit and is well adapted to arid and sandy environments. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in dry conditions. It plays an important role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
