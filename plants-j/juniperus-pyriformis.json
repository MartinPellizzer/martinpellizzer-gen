It is characterized by its pyramidal or conical shape, with dense, scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and whitish underneath. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are typically blue or purple when mature, containing aromatic seeds. It is adapted to arid environments and has a high tolerance for drought and poor soil conditions. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping."
