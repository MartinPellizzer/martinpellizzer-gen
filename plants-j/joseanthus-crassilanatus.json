    "intro": "Joseanthus crassilanatus, commonly known as the thick-leaved evergreen, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within cloud forests. Its leaves are thick and waxy, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Joseanthus crassilanatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
