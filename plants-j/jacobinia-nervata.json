    "intro": "Jacobinia nervata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvet tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Jacobinia nervata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks."
