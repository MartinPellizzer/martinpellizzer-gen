    "intro": "Juniperus sabina, commonly known as the savin juniper, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20135 meters, featuring dense, scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and whitish underneath. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Juniperus sabina is also valued for its aromatic wood, which has been used historically in various traditional applications."
