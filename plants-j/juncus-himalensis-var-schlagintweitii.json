It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are often covered in dense, grass-like foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in spike-like clusters at the top of the stems.
