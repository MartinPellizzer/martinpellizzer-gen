    "intro": "Juniperus \u00d7 media f. aurata, commonly known as the golden juniper, is a compact, ornamental conifer that exhibits striking golden foliage. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Juniperus media and Juniperus communis, showcasing a unique combination of traits from both parents. The plant's foliage transitions from a vibrant golden-green in spring to a more subdued green in summer, making it visually appealing throughout the growing season. It is typically grown as a small shrub or tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, and is well-suited for rock gardens or as a specimen plant. Its slow growth rate and hardy nature make it adaptable to a variety of garden conditions."
