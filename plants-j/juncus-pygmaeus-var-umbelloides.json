    "intro": "Juncus pygmaeus var. umbelloides, commonly known as the dwarf rush, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland environments. It features dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically reaches a height of only a few inches, making it well-suited for moist, compact habitats. Its compact size and ability to thrive in waterlogged soils make it a valuable species for wetland restoration projects. It is also often used in ornamental landscaping due to its delicate appearance and ease of cultivation."
