    "intro": "Jurinea efeae, commonly known as the Efeae's sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. It has small, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss, and its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens. Jurinea efeae is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging environments."
