    "intro": "Juniperus pingii var. chengii, commonly known as the Yunnan juniper, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree that typically grows in mountainous regions with cool, moist climates. The plant features scale-like leaves arranged in dense, compact clusters, and it produces small, berry-like cones that are typically blue or black in color. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in botanical gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
