    "intro": "Juniperus rigida f. longicarpa, commonly known as the long-fruit juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are edible and contain a fragrant resin. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and aesthetic qualities."
