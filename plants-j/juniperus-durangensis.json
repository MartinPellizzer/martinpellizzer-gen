    "intro": "Juniperus durangensis, commonly known as the Durango juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, rocky environments. Juniperus durangensis plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various species."
