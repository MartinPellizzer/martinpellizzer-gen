It is a shrub that typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are usually white or pale pink, arranged in clusters. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in water gardens or as an ornamental plant."
