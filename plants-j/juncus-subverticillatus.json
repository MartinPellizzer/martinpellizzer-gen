    "intro": "Juncus subverticillatus, commonly known as the clustered rush, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and pond margins. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife. Botanically, it is part of the Juncaceae family, which is distinct from the grass family (Poaceae) despite its grass-like appearance."
