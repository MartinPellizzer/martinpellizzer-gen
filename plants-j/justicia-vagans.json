    "intro": "Justicia vagans, commonly known as the wandering justicia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that resemble spikes of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a rough texture. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, especially hummingbirds, due to their bright colors and nectar-rich structure."
