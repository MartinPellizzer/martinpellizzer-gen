    "intro": "Juniperus chinensis columnaris, commonly known as the columnar Chinese juniper, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its narrow, upright growth habit, which makes it ideal for formal garden designs. The plant features scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and light gray underneath, providing a textured appearance. It produces small, blue-black berries that are edible but often used as ornamental features. This hardy species is well-suited to a variety of soil types and is resistant to pests and diseases."
