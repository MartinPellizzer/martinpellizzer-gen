    "intro": "Juncus alpinus var. microcarpus, commonly known as the alpine rush, is a low-growing perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette structure, adapted to withstand harsh mountain conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil in rocky or alpine environments. It is often found in moist, well-drained habitats such as meadows, streambanks, and mountain slopes."
