It belongs to the family Simaroubaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed. It is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable in some areas."
