    "intro": "Juglans alba odorata, commonly known as the sweet chestnut or white chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, palmately lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces clustered, spiny husks that enclose edible, sweet nuts. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Its ornamental value and edible nuts make it both a horticultural and agricultural species."
