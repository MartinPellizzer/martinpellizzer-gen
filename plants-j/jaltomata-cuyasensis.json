It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its tubular, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and is adapted to the cool, temperate climate of its native habitat. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that contain seeds. Jaltomata cuyasensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
