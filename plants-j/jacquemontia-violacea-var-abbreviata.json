    "intro": "Jacquemontia violacea var. abbreviata, commonly known as the short-stemmed blue morning glory, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the early morning, hence its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. This variant is distinguished by its shorter stem length compared to other varieties of Jacquemontia violacea."
