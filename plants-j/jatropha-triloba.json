    "intro": "Jatropha triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 3 meters in height, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with three distinct lobes. The plant produces yellow flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing toxic, orange-red seeds. It is known for its latex sap, which is milky and contains toxic compounds. Jatropha triloba is often found in disturbed areas and is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its toxicity requires caution."
