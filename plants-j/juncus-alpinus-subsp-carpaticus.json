    "intro": "Juncus alpinus subsp. carpaticus, commonly known as the Carpathian rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense spike-like clusters. It is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate snow cover during winter. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland and mountainous environments."
