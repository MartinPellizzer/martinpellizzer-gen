    "intro": "Juniperus mekongensis, commonly known as the Mekong juniper, is a species of juniper native to Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree that typically grows in mountainous regions. The plant has scale-like leaves that are tightly pressed against the branches, giving it a dense appearance. Its cones, which are typically blue or black, contain the aromatic seeds used in traditional medicine and as a spice. Juniperus mekongensis is adapted to harsh climates and is often found in rocky or arid environments."
