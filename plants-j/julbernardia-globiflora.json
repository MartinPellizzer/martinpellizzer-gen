It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces striking, globe-shaped inflorescences that are typically yellow or orange, with small, clustered flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Due to its unique appearance and limited natural range, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
