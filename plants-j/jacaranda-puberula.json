It is characterized by its striking clusters of violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are simple, ovate, and covered with fine, silky hairs, giving the plant its common name. The tree can grow up to 10 meters tall and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its wood is lightweight and has been used historically for construction and furniture-making."
