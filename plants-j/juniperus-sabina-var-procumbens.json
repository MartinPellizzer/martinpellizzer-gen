    "intro": "Juniperus sabina var. procumbens, commonly known as creeping juniper, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features dense, compact foliage composed of scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are usually blue or purple when mature, containing toxic seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant for rock gardens and slopes. Its slow growth habit and drought tolerance make it suitable for xeriscaping and erosion control."
