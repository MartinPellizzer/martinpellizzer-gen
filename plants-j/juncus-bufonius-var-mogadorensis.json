    "intro": "Juncus bufonius var. mogadorensis, commonly known as the Mogador rush, is a perennial plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along coastal areas and rocky outcrops. Its leaves are narrow and cylindrical, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging coastal environments."
