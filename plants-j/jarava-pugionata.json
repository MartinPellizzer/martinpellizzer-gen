    "intro": "Jarava pugionata, commonly known as the narrowleaf jarava, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Jarava pugionata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
