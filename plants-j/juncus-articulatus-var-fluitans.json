    "intro": "Juncus articulatus var. fluitans, commonly known as floating rush, is a variant of the common rush that exhibits aquatic adaptations. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the water column. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and cylindrical, often forming dense mats on the water's surface. This variant plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms."
