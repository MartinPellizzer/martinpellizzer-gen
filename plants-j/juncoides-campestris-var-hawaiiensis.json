    "intro": "Juncoides campestris var. hawaiiensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian flat sedge, is a perennial herb native to the island of Hawaii. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers. This plant typically grows in wet, lowland areas such as marshes and stream banks. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife. However, it is considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss and invasive species competition."
