    "intro": "Jussiaea floribunda, commonly known as the water primrose, is a semi-aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features floating leaves that are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its roots are fibrous and can spread rapidly, making it an effective colonizer of still or slow-moving water bodies. Jussiaea floribunda is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
