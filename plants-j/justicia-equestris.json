    "intro": "Justicia equestris, commonly known as the horse's head plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy bracts that resemble a horse's head, which are often more prominent than the small flowers themselves. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. The flowers, which are usually pink or red, bloom in terminal spikes and attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
