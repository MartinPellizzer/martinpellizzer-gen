    "intro": "Justicia sexsulcata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved false arum, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves that are often narrower than those of related species. The plant produces clusters of small, pale purple to white flowers that are borne on spikes, which are typical of the Acanthaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
