    "intro": "Juglans portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican hickory, is a deciduous tree native to the island of Puerto Rico. It belongs to the walnut family, Juglandaceae, and is characterized by its alternate, pinnately compound leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by edible nuts enclosed in a thick, woody husk. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
