    "intro": "Jussiaea multinervia, commonly known as the slender water plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It features narrow, linear leaves that are often submerged or floating, with prominent veins that give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically emerging from the water surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats and is often found in regions with high humidity. Jussiaea multinervia plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
