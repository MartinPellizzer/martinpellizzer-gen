    "intro": "Jonesia asoca, commonly known as the Indian orchid or the sacred orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of India and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, yellow, and pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, and it plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its native forests. Due to its ornamental value and cultural significance, Jonesia asoca is also cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
