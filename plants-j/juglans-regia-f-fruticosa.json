    "intro": "Juglans regia f. fruticosa, commonly known as the dwarf English walnut, is a compact, shrub-like form of the common walnut. It exhibits a more rounded growth habit compared to the typical tree form, with shorter branches and a dense canopy. The leaves are palmately lobed, with a deep green upper surface and a lighter underside, typical of the Juglandaceae family. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by the characteristic walnut fruits. This form is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its compact size and aesthetic appeal."
