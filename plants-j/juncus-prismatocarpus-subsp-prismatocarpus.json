    "intro": "Juncus prismatocarpus subsp. prismatocarpus, commonly known as the prismate carpus rush, is a flowering plant species native to Southeast Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and slender, cylindrical stems. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in wet or marshy environments, often found in coastal areas and freshwater habitats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation in suitable conditions."
