    "intro": "Juglans nigra, commonly known as black walnut, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dark, ridged bark and alternate, pinnately compound leaves. The tree produces clusters of green, spherical fruits called drupes, which mature to a dark brown color. Its seeds, enclosed in a hard, toxic husk, are a valuable food source for wildlife. Black walnut is also valued for its strong, durable wood and has historical uses in medicine and dye production."
