    "intro": "Juglans jamaicensis subsp. insularis, commonly known as the Jamaican hickory, is a rare and endemic species found primarily on the island of Hispaniola. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in lowland to montane forests. The plant produces large, edible nuts enclosed in a thick, woody husk, which are an important food source for various wildlife. It has compound leaves with long petioles and pinnate arrangement, and its flowers are dioecious, with separate male and female plants. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
