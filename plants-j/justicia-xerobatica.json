    "intro": "Justicia xerobatica, commonly known as the desert flame or desert justicia, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, characterized by its woody stems and dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ability to withstand high temperatures make it a valuable plant for landscaping in dry climates."
