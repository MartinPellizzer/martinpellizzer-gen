    "intro": "Jurinea pungens, commonly known as the pungent sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and succulent, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky habitats. Its ability to survive in harsh environments makes it an important component of desert ecosystems. Jurinea pungens is also noted for its medicinal properties, with some traditional uses in folk medicine."
