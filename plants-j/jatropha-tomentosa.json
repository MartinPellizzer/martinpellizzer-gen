    "intro": "Jatropha tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly jatropha, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its hairy, greyish foliage. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by orange to red berries containing toxic seeds. Its leaves are palmately lobed and often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Jatropha tomentosa is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh climates."
