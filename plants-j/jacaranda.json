    "intro": "Jacaranda, commonly known as the \"blue jacaranda,\" is a flowering tree native to South America. It is characterized by its striking clusters of violet or blue flowers that bloom in the spring. The tree has compound leaves with long, slender leaflets and produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release its seeds. Jacaranda wood is lightweight and durable, making it valuable for furniture and construction. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for urban landscaping in warm climates."
