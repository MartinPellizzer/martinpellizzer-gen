It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive white veins on its dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that eventually develop into capsule fruits containing toxic seeds. Jatropha leuconeura is known for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and is sometimes cultivated in gardens. However, it should be handled with care due to the presence of toxic compounds in its parts."
