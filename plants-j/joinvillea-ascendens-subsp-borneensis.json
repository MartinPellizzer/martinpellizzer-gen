It is a woody vine characterized by its rapid growth and ability to climb using aerial roots. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are typically consumed by local wildlife. Its leaves are broad and glossy, providing dense foliage that contributes to the forest canopy. This subspecies is valued for both its ecological role and its potential in horticultural cultivation."
