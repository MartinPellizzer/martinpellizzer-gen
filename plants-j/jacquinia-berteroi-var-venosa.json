    "intro": "Jacquinia berteroi var. venosa, commonly known as the variegated jacquinia, is a rare and striking plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive variegated foliage, featuring a combination of green, white, and sometimes pink or red hues. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly waxy texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in terminal inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
