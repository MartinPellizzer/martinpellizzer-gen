    "intro": "Jaeggia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Cucurbitaceae. It is characterized by its unique, often bioluminescent flowers that emit a faint glow, especially at night. The plant is native to certain regions of South America, particularly in Brazil and Peru. Jaeggia species typically grow as annual herbs with slender stems and small, heart-shaped leaves. Its botanical interest lies in its unusual floral structure and potential medicinal properties that are still being studied."
