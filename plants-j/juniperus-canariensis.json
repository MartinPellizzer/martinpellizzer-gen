    "intro": "Juniperus canariensis, commonly known as the Canary Island juniper, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces blue-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and inland environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
