    "intro": "Jaundea pubescens, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by round, fleshy fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in moist lowland areas. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively, it can become a weed in agricultural settings."
