    "intro": "Jussiaea pumila, commonly known as the dwarf water primrose, is a low-growing aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in South America. It features small, narrow leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a waxy surface that helps it resist water currents. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving water and is often found in association with other aquatic vegetation. Jussiaea pumila plays a role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
