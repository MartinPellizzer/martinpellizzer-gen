    "intro": "Juniperus virginiana subsp. silicicola, commonly known as the sand juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the central and southern United States. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, blue-gray needles. The plant produces cones that contain aromatic, resinous seeds, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. This subspecies is well adapted to arid environments and plays a significant role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
