    "intro": "Juncoides pilosa, commonly known as the hairy rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks, wetlands, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. The plant features cylindrical, grass-like stems covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense spikes, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Juncoides pilosa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and small aquatic organisms."
