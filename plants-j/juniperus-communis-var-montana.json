    "intro": "Juniperus communis var. montana, commonly known as the mountain juniper, is a hardy evergreen shrub or small tree native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, providing a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions, rocky slopes, and open woodlands. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
