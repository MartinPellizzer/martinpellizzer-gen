    "intro": "Juncus aristatus, commonly known as the tall rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Juncus aristatus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
