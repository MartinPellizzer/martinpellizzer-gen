It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height. The plant is characterized by its hairy, velvety leaves that give it its common name. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its spread in the wild."
