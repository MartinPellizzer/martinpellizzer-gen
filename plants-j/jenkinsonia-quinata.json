    "intro": "Jenkinsonia quinata, commonly known as the silverleaf jenkinsonia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense, overlapping scales on the leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with moderate to high salt exposure. Jenkinsonia quinata is often found in rocky habitats and is considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss."
