    "intro": "Jacea nemecii, commonly known as the Himalayan snowbell, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Jacea nemecii is considered a rare and endangered species."
