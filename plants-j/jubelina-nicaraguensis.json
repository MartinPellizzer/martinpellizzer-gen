    "intro": "Jubelina nicaraguensis, commonly known as the Nicaraguan jubelina, is a flowering plant native to Central America. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Jubelina nicaraguensis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a food source for various insect pollinators and small vertebrates."
