    "intro": "Japonicalia tebakoensis, commonly known as the Tebakoensis fern, is a rare species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that exhibit a unique spiral arrangement. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found along forest floors or in rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing cones, are typically concealed within the foliage. Due to habitat loss, Japonicalia tebakoensis is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
