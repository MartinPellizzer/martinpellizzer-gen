    "intro": "Juncus lomatophyllus var. aristatus, commonly known as the tufted rush, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and cylindrical stems that often bear clusters of small, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swales, and riparian areas. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and the inflorescence is composed of multiple spikelets arranged in a compact, upright cluster. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
