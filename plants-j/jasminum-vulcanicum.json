    "intro": "Jasminum vulcanicum, commonly known as the volcanic jasmine, is a flowering plant native to the volcanic regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often emitting a sweet, intoxicating scent. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with opposite, simple leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by nocturnal insects such as moths, and it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Despite its ornamental value, it is relatively rare and has limited distribution in the wild."
