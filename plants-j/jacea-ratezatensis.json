    "intro": "Jacea ratezatensis, commonly known as the R\u0103\u021be\u0219ti bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Romania. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, pale blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich soils at elevations between 1,200 and 2,000 meters. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and branched. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Jacea ratezatensis is considered endangered and is protected in several national parks."
