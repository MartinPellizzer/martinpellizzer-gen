It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, exhibiting a preference for full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its inflorescence consists of multiple flowering spikes that bloom in late summer. This plant plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
