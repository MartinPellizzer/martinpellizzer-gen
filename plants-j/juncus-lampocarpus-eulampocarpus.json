    "intro": "Juncus lampocarpus eulampocarpus, commonly known as the coastal rush, is a perennial plant native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that grow in dense clusters, often reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in panicles at the top of the stems, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand salty air and coastal winds. This species thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shores and dunes, playing a vital role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
