    "intro": "Juniperus communis subsp. hemisphaerica, commonly known as the spherical juniper, is a subspecies of the common juniper that is characterized by its dense, spherical growth habit. It is a evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. Its foliage consists of scale-like leaves that are arranged in dense clusters, giving the plant a compact appearance. This subspecies is well adapted to harsh environments, including rocky soils and cold climates."
