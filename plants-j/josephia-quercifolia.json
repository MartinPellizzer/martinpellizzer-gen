    "intro": "Josephia quercifolia, commonly known as the oak-leaved josephia, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves that resemble those of an oak tree, with lobed or serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, which are followed by orange or red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes."
