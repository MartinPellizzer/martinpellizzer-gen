    "intro": "Jacquemontia ruderaria, commonly known as the yellow balsam, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange, with five petals and a distinctive spur. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy and covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a host plant for certain butterfly species and its ornamental value in wetland gardens."
