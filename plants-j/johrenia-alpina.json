    "intro": "Johrenia alpina, commonly known as the alpine lily, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving at high altitudes where temperatures are cool and the soil is well-drained. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette that helps conserve moisture in harsh conditions. Johrenia alpina is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine displays."
