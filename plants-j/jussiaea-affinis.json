    "intro": "Jussiaea affinis, commonly known as the marsh willow or water willow, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in South America. It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, adapting to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Jussiaea affinis plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic insects and small vertebrates."
