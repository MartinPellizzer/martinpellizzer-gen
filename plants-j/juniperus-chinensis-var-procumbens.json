    "intro": "Juniperus chinensis var. procumbens, commonly known as creeping juniper, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to East Asia. It features dense, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, providing a lush, carpet-like appearance. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice in horticulture."
