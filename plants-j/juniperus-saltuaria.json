    "intro": "Juniperus saltuaria, commonly known as the dwarf juniper, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, needle-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spherical blue berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Juniperus saltuaria is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardiness."
