    "intro": "Juncus glaucus equisetosus, commonly known as the silver rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a waxy, silvery coating, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, which are often surrounded by bracts. It thrives in moist environments such as wetlands, stream banks, and marshes. Botanically, it is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and its ability to tolerate waterlogged soils."
