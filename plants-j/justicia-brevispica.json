    "intro": "Justicia brevispica, commonly known as the short-horned flame flower, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant red or orange tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
