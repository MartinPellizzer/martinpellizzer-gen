    "intro": "Juncus balticus subsp. littoralis, commonly known as the Baltic rush, is a perennial plant native to coastal and wetland areas of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in saline or brackish environments, such as salt marshes and tidal zones, where it thrives in moist to submerged soil conditions. The plant has slender, grass-like stems that are often reddish or purple in color, and it produces small, clustered spikelets of greenish or brownish flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that stabilize shorelines. This subspecies is adapted to withstand periodic flooding and salt spray, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
