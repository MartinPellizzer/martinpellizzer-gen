    "intro": "Juniperus pseudosabina, commonly known as the creeping juniper, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are edible and often used in culinary and medicinal applications. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, arid environments. Juniperus pseudosabina is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soils in rocky landscapes."
