This subspecies typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid climates. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
