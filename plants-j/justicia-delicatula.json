    "intro": "Justicia delicatula, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf false arum, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that are often surrounded by showy, bract-like structures. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain areas."
