    "intro": "Juncus bufonius var. repens, commonly known as the running bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to the eastern United States. It forms dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves that often grow along the edges of ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes during the summer months, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it an effective colonizer of disturbed wetland areas. It plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
