    "intro": "Juniperus excelsa stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf juniper, is a species of coniferous evergreen shrub or tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for various birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. The narrowleaf juniper is often used in landscaping for its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
