    "intro": "Juncus nutans, commonly known as the nodding rush, is a perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that bend downward, giving it a nodding appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters near the top of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in moist to aquatic environments. Juncus nutans plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
