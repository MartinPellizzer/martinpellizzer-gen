    "intro": "Juniperus foetidissima, commonly known as the stinking juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, scale-like leaves and small, blue-black berries that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant is highly adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots and a dense, compact growth habit. Its foliage contains volatile oils that give it a strong, pungent odor, which is both a defense mechanism and a key feature in its ecological interactions. Juniperus foetidissima plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
