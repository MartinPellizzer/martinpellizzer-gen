    "intro": "Juncus alpinus subsp. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine rush, is a perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and is often found growing in moist, rocky habitats. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of greenish-yellow flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is well adapted to cold climates and can thrive at high altitudes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
