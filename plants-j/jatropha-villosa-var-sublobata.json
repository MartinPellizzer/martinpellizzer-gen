    "intro": "Jatropha villosa var. sublobata, commonly known as the hairy jatropha, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves with a serrated or lobed margin. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers followed by orange or red berries containing toxic seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas. Due to its ornamental value and potential for biofuel production, it is sometimes cultivated despite its toxic properties."
