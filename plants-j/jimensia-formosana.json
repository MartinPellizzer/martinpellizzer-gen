    "intro": "Jimensia formosana, commonly known as the Formosan jimsonweed, is a flowering plant native to Taiwan. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces violet to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Jimensia formosana is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open fields, where it thrives in full sun. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a potential weed in agricultural areas."
