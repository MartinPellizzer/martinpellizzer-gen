    "intro": "Jurinea kopetensis, commonly known as the Kopetdag sandflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure adapted to harsh desert environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months, and its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and inland deserts. Due to its specialized habitat, Jurinea kopetensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
