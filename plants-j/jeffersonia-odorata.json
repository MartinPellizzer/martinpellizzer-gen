    "intro": "Jeffersonia odorata, commonly known as the Jeffersonia or the pinkroot, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive pink or red flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a thick, fleshy root system that stores nutrients and helps it survive in its woodland habitat. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three heart-shaped leaflets, and it prefers moist, well-drained soils. Jeffersonia odorata is often found in shaded areas and is an important component of the understory vegetation in eastern forests."
