    "intro": "Jacaranda glabra, commonly known as the white jacaranda, is a deciduous tree native to South Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and its striking clusters of pale blue or white flowers that bloom in summer. The leaves are bipinnate, consisting of multiple pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets. The tree produces small, woody pods that contain several seeds, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to warm, sunny climates."
