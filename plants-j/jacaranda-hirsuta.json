    "intro": "Jacaranda hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy jacaranda, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and its striking clusters of violet-blue flowers that bloom in the spring. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a rough, hairy texture, giving the plant its common name. The plant produces woody pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in warm climates."
