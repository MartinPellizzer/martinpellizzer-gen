    "intro": "Justicia antidota, commonly known as the antidote plant, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet or purple tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The flowers are primarily pollinated by birds, especially hummingbirds, due to their tubular shape and nectar-rich structure."
