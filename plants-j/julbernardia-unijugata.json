    "intro": "Julbernardia unijugata, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a tropical tree native to central and eastern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, palmate leaves that are typically lobed. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, elongated fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rainforest or savanna habitats. Due to its slow growth and valuable timber, it is considered a threatened species in some regions."
