    "intro": "Jatropha inermiflora, commonly known as the smooth-flowered physic nut, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange-red berries containing toxic seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in semi-arid conditions. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
