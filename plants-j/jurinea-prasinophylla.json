    "intro": "Jurinea prasinophylla, commonly known as the green-leaved sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system is extensive and adapted to anchor it in sandy soils while accessing deep water sources. Jurinea prasinophylla is often found in dunes and rocky areas where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
