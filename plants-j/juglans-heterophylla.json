    "intro": "Juglans heterophylla, commonly known as the California black walnut, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It belongs to the walnut family, Juglandaceae, and is characterized by its alternate, compound leaves that vary in shape depending on the light conditions. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by edible nuts enclosed in a thick, ridged husk. Its wood is highly valued for its strength and durability, while its leaves and husks contain juglone, a compound that can be toxic to certain plants and animals."
