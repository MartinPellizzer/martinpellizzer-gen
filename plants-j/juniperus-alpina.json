    "intro": "Juniperus alpina, commonly known as the alpine juniper, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant has scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and whitish underneath, and it produces small, blue-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and small mammals. Juniperus alpina is adapted to cold climates and can survive in harsh conditions with minimal water. Its hardy nature makes it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
