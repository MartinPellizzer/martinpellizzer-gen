    "intro": "Jussiaea nervosa var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved water plant, is a semi-aquatic plant native to South America. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length, arranged in a whorled pattern around the stems. The plant thrives in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Its roots are often submerged, while the stems and leaves remain partially or fully above water. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in aquatic habitats."
