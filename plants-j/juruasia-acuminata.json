It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its palm-like leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
