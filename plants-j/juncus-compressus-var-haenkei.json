    "intro": "Juncus compressus var. haenkei, commonly known as the narrowleaf rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist to wet environments such as marshes, stream banks, and roadside ditches. The plant features slender, cylindrical stems that are often slightly compressed, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, three-lobed flowers. This variety is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
