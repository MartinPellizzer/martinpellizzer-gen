    "intro": "Juncus sylvaticus, commonly known as the wood rush, is a perennial flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Juncaceae and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and tall spikes of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, which can stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Juncus sylvaticus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland habitats."
