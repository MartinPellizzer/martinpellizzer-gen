    "intro": "Jurinea dolomiaea var. tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet. It thrives in arid, sandy environments and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. The plant features a mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy leaves that store moisture. Its flowers are typically pale yellow or greenish, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to harsh alpine conditions."
