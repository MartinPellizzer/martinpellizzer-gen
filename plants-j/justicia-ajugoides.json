    "intro": "Justicia ajugoides, commonly known as Mexican verbena, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink, red, or purple, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-tolerant plants. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
