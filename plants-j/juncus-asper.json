    "intro": "Juncus asper, commonly known as rough rush, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and stout, cylindrical stems that often grow in wet or marshy environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish or brownish flowers in spike-like clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil in wetland habitats, making it ecologically significant. Juncus asper is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions."
