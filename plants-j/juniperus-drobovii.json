    "intro": "Juniperus drobovii, commonly known as the Drobovii juniper, is a species of coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid climates. The plant features scale-like leaves that are tightly packed, giving it a dense, compact appearance. Its cones are small and berry-like, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its hardiness and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental qualities."
