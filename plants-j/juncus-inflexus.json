    "intro": "Juncus inflexus, commonly known as the flexible rush, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is a member of the Juncaceae family and typically grows in marshy or pond edges where the soil is consistently moist. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of greenish-white flowers. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. Juncus inflexus is an important component of aquatic ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
