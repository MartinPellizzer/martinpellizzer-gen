    "intro": "Juniperus sabina var. excelsa, commonly known as the Serbian juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces tiny, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. This variety is noted for its hardiness and ability to withstand harsh climatic conditions."
