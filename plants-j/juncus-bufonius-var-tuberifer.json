    "intro": "Juncus bufonius var. tuberifer, commonly known as the tuberous rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and the presence of underground tubers, which are its most distinctive botanical feature. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, and its stems are usually erect and cylindrical. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in spike-like clusters, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. The tubers of this species are sometimes used in traditional practices and can be an important food source for certain wildlife."
