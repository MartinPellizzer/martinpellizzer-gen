    "intro": "Juncus lampocarpus var. alpigenus, commonly known as the alpine rush, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves that are typically dark green to reddish in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in alpine and subalpine environments."
