    "intro": "Juncus bufonius f. bracteatus, commonly known as the bracted rush, is a flowering plant belonging to the Juncaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered spikelets of flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, thriving in moist soils. Its leaves are narrow and cylindrical, often with a slightly rough texture. The bracted form refers to the presence of specialized leaf-like structures at the base of the inflorescence, distinguishing it from other varieties of the species."
