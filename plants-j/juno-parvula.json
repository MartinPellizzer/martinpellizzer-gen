    "intro": "Juno parvula, commonly known as the dwarf juniper, is a small evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, cone-like fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Juno parvula is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. It is often used in rock gardens and as a low-maintenance ornamental plant."
