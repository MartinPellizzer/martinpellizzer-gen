    "intro": "Juncus vernalis, commonly known as the spring rush, is a herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant produces tall, cylindrical spikes of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often form dense clumps. Juncus vernalis is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
