    "intro": "Justicia sangilensis, commonly known as the golden trumpet or sangil trumpet, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, especially hummingbirds, due to their bright color and nectar-rich structure."
