    "intro": "Juncus effusus, commonly known as soft rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. The plant has cylindrical, grass-like stems that are usually reddish-brown in color and lack true leaves, instead having small, scale-like structures. Its flowers are arranged in dense, spike-like clusters and are often wind-pollinated. Juncus effusus plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
