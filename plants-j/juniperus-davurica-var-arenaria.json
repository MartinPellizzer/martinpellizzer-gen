    "intro": "Juniperus davurica var. arenaria, commonly known as sand juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves and small, berry-like cones that mature to a blue or purple color. The plant is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or rocky soils, making it well adapted to harsh environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion. Its aromatic foliage and resilience make it a valuable species in ecological restoration projects."
