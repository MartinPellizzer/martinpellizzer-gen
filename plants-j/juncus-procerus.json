    "intro": "Juncus procerus, commonly known as the tall rush, is a perennial plant native to wetlands and moist environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters at the top of the stems, typically in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often growing in dense tufts. Juncus procerus plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
