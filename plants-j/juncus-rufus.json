    "intro": "Juncus rufus, commonly known as red rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland areas in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense stands that help stabilize shorelines. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color, especially when mature. Its leaves are grass-like and narrow, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer. Juncus rufus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
