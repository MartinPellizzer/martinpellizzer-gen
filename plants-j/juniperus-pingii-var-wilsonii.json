    "intro": "Juniperus pingii var. wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are typically dark blue to black when mature, containing toxic seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest."
