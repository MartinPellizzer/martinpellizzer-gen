    "intro": "Jamesonia laxa, commonly known as the Appalachian bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features basal rosettes of lance-shaped, hairy leaves and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils in woodlands and streambanks. It blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
