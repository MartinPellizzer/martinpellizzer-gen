It is characterized by its tall, slender, grass-like stems that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wet or marshy environments and is often found along riverbanks and in coastal areas. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it an important plant for ecological restoration projects."
