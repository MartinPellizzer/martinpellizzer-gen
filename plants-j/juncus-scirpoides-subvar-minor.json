    "intro": "Juncus scirpoides subvar. minor, commonly known as the dwarf rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in the southeastern United States. It features slender, grass-like stems that grow close to the ground, typically reaching heights of 10\u201330 cm. The plant produces small, cylindrical spikes of pale green to brown flowers, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a slightly rough texture. This subspecies is adapted to moist or water-saturated soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
