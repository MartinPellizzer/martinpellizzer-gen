    "intro": "Jasonia rupestris, commonly known as the rock jasmine, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features small, waxy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, helping to conserve moisture in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often blooming in spring. Its succulent nature allows it to store water, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Jasonia rupestris is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
