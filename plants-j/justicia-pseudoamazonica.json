    "intro": "Justicia pseudoamazonica, commonly known as the red hot poker or flame flower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular red or orange flowers that resemble torches. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, especially hummingbirds, due to their bright color and nectar-rich structure. Justicia pseudoamazonica is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in full sun."
