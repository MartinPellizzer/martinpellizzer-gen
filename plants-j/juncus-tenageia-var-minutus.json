    "intro": "Juncus tenageia var. minutus, commonly known as the dwarf rush, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It typically forms dense clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes during the late spring and summer months. It thrives in wet or moist soils, often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as a decorative plant."
