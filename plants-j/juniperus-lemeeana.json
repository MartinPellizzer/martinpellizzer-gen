    "intro": "Juniperus lemeeana, commonly known as the African juniper, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, blue-gray leaves that are densely packed, providing a distinctive appearance. It bears red or purple berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Juniperus lemeeana is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
