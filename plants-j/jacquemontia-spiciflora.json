    "intro": "Jacquemontia spiciflora, commonly known as the spiculate false morning glory, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and produces clusters of small, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its flowers are often adorned with a distinctive spiculate (spiny) structure on the corolla. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant's botanical features make it a valuable component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical studies."
