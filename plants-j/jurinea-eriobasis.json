    "intro": "Jurinea eriobasis, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with narrow, silver-gray leaves that help it survive in arid and saline environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or coastal grasslands. Due to its adaptability, it is considered an important pioneer species in ecological succession along shorelines."
