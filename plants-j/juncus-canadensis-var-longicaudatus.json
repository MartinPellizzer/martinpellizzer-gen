    "intro": "Juncus canadensis var. longicaudatus, commonly known as the long-tailed rush, is a variant of the common rush found in wetland habitats across North America. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically greenish or reddish in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slight sheen, and it thrives in moist to aquatic environments. This variant is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
