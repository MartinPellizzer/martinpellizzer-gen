    "intro": "Janusia diminuta, commonly known as the small Janusia, is a diminutive flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescence. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky soils, thriving in cool, temperate climates. Its small stature and unique floral structure make it a subject of interest for botanists studying alpine flora. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
