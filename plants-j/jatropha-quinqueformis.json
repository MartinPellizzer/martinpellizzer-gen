    "intro": "Jatropha quinqueformis, commonly known as the five-lobed spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 3 meters in height, featuring rough, ridged bark and dark green, alternate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into orange-red, fleshy berries containing toxic seeds. It is part of the Euphorbiaceae family, known for its milky sap and various medicinal uses in traditional practices. However, the plant is also considered invasive in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
