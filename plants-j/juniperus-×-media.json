    "intro": "Juniperus \u00d7 media, commonly known as the common juniper, is a hybrid coniferous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, which consists of scale-like leaves arranged in dense, flat sprays. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are borne in cone-like structures, which are a key feature in its reproductive cycle. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, heathlands, and rocky areas. Juniperus \u00d7 media is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in landscaping and as a source of aromatic wood."
