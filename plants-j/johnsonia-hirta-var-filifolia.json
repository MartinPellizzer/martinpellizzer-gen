    "intro": "Johnsonia hirta var. filifolia, commonly known as the silky Johnsonia, is a rare and delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its finely divided, soft, and silky-textured fronds that give it a unique appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for shaded garden settings. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, contributing to its common name. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
