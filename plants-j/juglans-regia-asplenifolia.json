    "intro": "Juglans regia asplenifolia, commonly known as the Persian walnut with asplenium-like leaves, is a rare and ornamental variant of the Persian walnut tree. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that resemble those of the asplenium genus, giving it a unique and delicate appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by oval, edible nuts enclosed in a thick, husky shell. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and requires full sun for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and specialized horticultural collections."
