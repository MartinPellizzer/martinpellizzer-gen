    "intro": "Jatropha arcuata, commonly known as the zigzag spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive zigzagging stems and alternate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange or red berries containing toxic seeds. Jatropha arcuata is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks. Its latex sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, making it a plant to handle with care."
