    "intro": "Justicia fleckii, commonly known as the Fleck's flame flower, is a striking tropical plant native to parts of Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant, tubular red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Justicia fleckii is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
