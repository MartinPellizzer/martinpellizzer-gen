    "intro": "Jussiaea lithospermifolia, commonly known as the rock pepper or stone root, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy, often succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in well-drained conditions. Its stems are prostrate or ascending, and it produces small, red or orange fruits that contain seeds. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to harsh, alpine habitats."
