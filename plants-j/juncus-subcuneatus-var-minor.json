    "intro": "Juncus subcuneatus var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf rush, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetlands and moist soils in North America. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in height, forming dense mats near water sources. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems."
