    "intro": "Juncus leschenaultii, commonly known as the Leschenault's rush, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves and spikes of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, making it a common ornamental in gardens. Juncus leschenaultii is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
