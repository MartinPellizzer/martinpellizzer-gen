    "intro": "Juncus cylindricus, commonly known as the cylindrical rush, is a perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features tall, cylindrical stems that are typically hollow and covered in fine, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters near the base of the stems, which are often surrounded by bracts. It thrives in moist to water-saturated soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects. Its dense growth helps stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
