It is a small evergreen shrub or tree with needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
