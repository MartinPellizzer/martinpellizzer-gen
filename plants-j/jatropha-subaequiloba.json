    "intro": "Jatropha subaequiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cupped spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical in shape with a slightly cupped base. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by capsule fruits containing toxic seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along streambanks. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
