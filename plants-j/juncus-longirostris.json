    "intro": "Juncus longirostris, commonly known as the long-beaked rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly curved, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters at the tips of its stems. Juncus longirostris is characterized by its elongated, tapering flower spikes that distinguish it from other rush species. It plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
