    "intro": "Jacobaea vulgaris subsp. vulgaris, commonly known as common tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant contains toxic compounds, including pyrethrins, which have historically been used in insecticides. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found along roadsides and in meadows. Its aromatic properties and medicinal uses have made it both valuable and potentially hazardous."
