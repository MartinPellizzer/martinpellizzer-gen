It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are adapted to store water. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, and it is often found in sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are edible and have been used traditionally by indigenous peoples for their nutritional value. The plant's ability to thrive in harsh environments makes it an important species in ecological restoration efforts."
