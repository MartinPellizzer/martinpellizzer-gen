    "intro": "Juncus bolanderi, commonly known as Bolander's rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in open habitats such as meadows, stream banks, and forest edges. The plant features tall, cylindrical stems that are often reddish or purple in color, and it produces small, clustered spikelets of flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming dense clumps that help stabilize soil. Bolander's rush is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
