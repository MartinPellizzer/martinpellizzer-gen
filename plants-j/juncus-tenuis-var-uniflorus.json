    "intro": "Juncus tenuis var. uniflorus, commonly known as the slender rush with a single flower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland environments. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a single spike of small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical structure is adapted for water retention, with a fibrous root system and hollow stems. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
