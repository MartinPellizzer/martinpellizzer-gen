    "intro": "Juncus przewalskii var. multiflorus, commonly known as the multiflorous rush, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny white flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. It has a robust root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
