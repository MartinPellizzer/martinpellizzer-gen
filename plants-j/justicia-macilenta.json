    "intro": "Justicia macilenta, commonly known as the pale justicia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or white, which bloom in summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or near water sources. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely cultivated commercially."
