    "intro": "Jacobaea angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf ragwort, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a powdery coating. Jacobaea angustifolia is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and meadows. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
