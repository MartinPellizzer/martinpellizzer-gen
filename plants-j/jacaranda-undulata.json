    "intro": "Jacaranda undulata, commonly known as the undulating jacaranda, is a deciduous tree native to South America, particularly Argentina and Uruguay. It is characterized by its striking clusters of violet-blue flowers that bloom in the spring. The leaves are pinnate, with long, slender leaflets that give the tree a feathery appearance. The bark is smooth and grayish, often exfoliating to reveal a lighter inner layer. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often planted in gardens and along streets for its aesthetic appeal."
