    "intro": "Juncus setchuensis f. compactus, commonly known as the compact rush, is a compact, herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It features dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a low, bushy growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, typically arranged in spikes. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshy areas or along stream banks. Its compact form makes it a popular choice for ornamental planting in water gardens and bog landscapes."
