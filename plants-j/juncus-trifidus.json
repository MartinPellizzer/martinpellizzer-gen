    "intro": "Juncus trifidus, commonly known as the three-lobed rush, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. The plant has slender, grass-like stems that are often clustered and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes during the summer months. Juncus trifidus plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
