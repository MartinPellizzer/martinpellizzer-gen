    "intro": "Juglans glabra, commonly known as the smooth walnut, is a deciduous tree native to the United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The tree produces hard, green husks that encase its edible, oily seeds. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in river valleys and along forest edges. The smooth walnut is valued for its timber and nuts, which are used in both culinary and industrial applications."
