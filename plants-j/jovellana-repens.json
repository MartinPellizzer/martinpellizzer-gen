    "intro": "Jovellana repens, commonly known as the creeping jovellana, is a low-growing perennial plant native to certain regions of South America. It features slender, spreading stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its leaves are elliptical, slightly hairy, and arranged alternately along the stems. Jovellana repens thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks."
