    "intro": "Justicia karsticola, commonly known as the Karstic false heather, is a flowering plant native to the karst landscapes of southern Africa. It is a shrub characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant produces bright blue or violet flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapted to the dry, rocky environments it inhabits. Justicia karsticola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
