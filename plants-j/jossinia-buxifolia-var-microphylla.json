    "intro": "Jossinia buxifolia var. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf boxwood, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are densely packed, giving it a dense, boxwood-like appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of no more than 30 centimeters, making it ideal for use in rock gardens or as a topiary. Its foliage remains dark green throughout the year, and it produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in the spring. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ease of maintenance in garden settings."
