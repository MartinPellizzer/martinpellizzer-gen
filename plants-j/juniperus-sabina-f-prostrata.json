    "intro": "Juniperus sabina f. prostrata, commonly known as creeping juniper, is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. It features small, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, providing a striking visual contrast against its dark, woody stems. The plant produces tiny, spherical berries that are often used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent. It is native to regions of Europe and Asia, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. This hardy species is well-suited for rock gardens and as a ground cover in arid or coastal environments."
