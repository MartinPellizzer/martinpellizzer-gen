    "intro": "Jatropha brockmanii, commonly known as the African croton, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has been studied for its potential in phytoremediation due to its ability to accumulate heavy metals."
