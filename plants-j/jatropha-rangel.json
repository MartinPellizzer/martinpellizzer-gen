    "intro": "Jatropha rangel, commonly known as the coffee bean plant, is a flowering shrub native to tropical regions. It produces small, yellow flowers that develop into capsules containing toxic seeds. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and is often found in disturbed soils. Its latex sap contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Despite its toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes or as a source of natural rubber."
