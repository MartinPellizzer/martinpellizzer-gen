    "intro": "Juncus littoralis, commonly known as coastal rush, is a perennial plant native to coastal areas of the Northern Hemisphere. It thrives in brackish or saline wetlands, often found in estuaries, salt marshes, and along shorelines. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that are often used in basket weaving and thatching. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of white or greenish flowers. Juncus littoralis plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
