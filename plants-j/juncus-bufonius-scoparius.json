It is a member of the Juncaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that grows in clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or brown, arranged in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems. Its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels makes it a valuable indicator species for wetland health."
