    "intro": "Juncus \u00d7 fulvescens, commonly known as the yellow rush, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Juncaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer. Native to the eastern United States, it thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily in suitable moist environments."
