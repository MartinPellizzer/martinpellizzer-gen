It features scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and whitish underneath, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are edible but often used in ornamental hedges due to their hardy nature. It is valued in horticulture for its dense foliage and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. This variety is particularly noted for its adaptability to urban environments and resistance to pests and diseases."
