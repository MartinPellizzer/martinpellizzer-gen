    "intro": "Jasione maritima subsp. gallaecica, commonly known as the Galician sea bell, is a flowering plant native to the western coasts of Europe. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in coastal environments, often found on sandy or gravelly soils. The plant features slender stems and small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution along the Atlantic coast."
