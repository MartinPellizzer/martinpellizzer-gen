    "intro": "Jasione amethystina var. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic jasione, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, hairy stems and small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in dune environments, where it is adapted to withstand salty air and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and its role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
