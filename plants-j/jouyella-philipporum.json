    "intro": "Jouyella philipporum, commonly known as the Philippine orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its roots are often epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil. This orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas."
