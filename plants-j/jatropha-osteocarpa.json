    "intro": "Jatropha osteocarpa, commonly known as the bone-fruit jatropha, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to orange-red, fleshy fruits containing toxic seeds. The seeds are encased in a hard, woody capsule and are often used in traditional medicine. Due to its toxic properties, handling the plant requires caution."
