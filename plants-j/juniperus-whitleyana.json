    "intro": "Juniperus whitleyana, commonly known as the Whitley juniper, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its scale-like leaves and small, blue-gray berries that are typically retained on the plant for several years. The plant is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. It produces fragrant, resinous wood that is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in xeriscapes due to its drought tolerance."
