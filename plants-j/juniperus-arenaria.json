    "intro": "Juniperus arenaria, commonly known as sand juniper, is a hardy evergreen shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its scale-like leaves and small, blue-gray berries that are often used in herbal medicine. The plant is well adapted to sandy and rocky soils, making it a common pioneer species in disturbed or dry environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion. Its aromatic foliage and resilience to drought make it a valuable plant in xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
