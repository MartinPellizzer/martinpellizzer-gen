It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
