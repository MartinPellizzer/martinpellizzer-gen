    "intro": "Juncus balticus subsp. cantabricus, commonly known as the Cantabrian rush, is a perennial plant native to the coastal regions of northern Spain and western France. It thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils along sea cliffs and dunes, often in areas exposed to salt spray. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny white or greenish flowers. It is adapted to harsh coastal environments and plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems. Its botanical features make it an important indicator species for coastal habitats."
