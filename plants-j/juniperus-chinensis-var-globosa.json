    "intro": "Juniperus chinensis var. globosa, commonly known as the globe juniper, is a compact, spherical shrub native to China. It features small, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny, berry-like cones that are reddish-purple when mature, adding visual interest in the winter. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. This variety is also valued for its aromatic foliage and slow growth rate, which makes it ideal for topiary and ornamental purposes."
