    "intro": "Juniperus cedrus f. fastigiata, commonly known as the upright form of the cedar juniper, is a compact, coniferous shrub or small tree native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, columnar growth habit, with stiff, scale-like leaves that are dark green in color. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are typically harvested in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a landscape specimen. Its ornamental value lies in its neat form and seasonal color changes, particularly in the autumn."
