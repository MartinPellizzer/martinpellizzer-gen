    "intro": "Juncus alpigenus, commonly known as the alpine rush, is a perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and spike-like clusters of small, greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are narrow and cylindrical, often covered with a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Juncus alpigenus plays an important role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
