    "intro": "Jussiaea suffruticosa var. macropoda, commonly known as the large-leaved jussiaea, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and broad, ovate leaves that are often pubescent. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its flowering period generally occurs during the warmer months, and it is adapted to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. The species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphological features and ecological adaptations."
