    "intro": "Juglans regia var. oblonga, commonly known as the Persian walnut, is a cultivar of the Persian walnut tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, oval-shaped nuts that are typically larger and more robust than those of the standard Persian walnut. The tree produces compound leaves with long, serrated leaflets and bears green, inedible fruit that turns brown as it matures. The wood of this variety is highly valued for its strength and fine grain, making it suitable for furniture and cabinetry. It is also cultivated for its edible nuts, which are prized for their rich flavor and nutritional value."
