    "intro": "Juncus insulanus, commonly known as the island rush, is a perennial plant native to coastal and wetland areas of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in saline or brackish environments, such as tidal flats and salt marshes. The plant has slender, grass-like stems that are often clustered and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes during the summer months. Juncus insulanus plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wetland species."
