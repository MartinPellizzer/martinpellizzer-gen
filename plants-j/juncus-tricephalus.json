    "intro": "Juncus tricephalus, commonly known as the three-headed rush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Juncaceae. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often found in temperate regions. The plant is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color and bear small, inconspicuous flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces three distinct flower clusters at the top of each stem, giving it its common name. Juncus tricephalus plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
