It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky soils. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often hairy as well. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
