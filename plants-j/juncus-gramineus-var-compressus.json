It features slender, cylindrical stems that are often compressed, giving it a distinct appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences composed of numerous tiny, greenish-brown flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically growing in dense clusters at the base. This variety is valued for its ability to thrive in moist conditions and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
