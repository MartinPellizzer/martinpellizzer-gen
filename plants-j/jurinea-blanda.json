    "intro": "Jurinea blanda, commonly known as the common sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal dunes and open grasslands. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are hairy and lobed, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Jurinea blanda is valued for its resilience and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
