    "intro": "Jussiaea costata, commonly known as the coastal bladderwort, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its small, inconspicuous flowers and its ability to thrive in saline or brackish water environments. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of tidal pools. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface. Jussiaea costata plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
