    "intro": "Jurinea multiflora, commonly known as the many-flowered sea bladder, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or rocky soils, often found in saline environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. Its leaves are succulent and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid conditions. Jurinea multiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
