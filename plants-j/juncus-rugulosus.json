    "intro": "Juncus rugulosus, commonly known as the rough sedgeland rush, is a perennial plant native to the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, rough texture. Its flowering stems produce clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Juncus rugulosus plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
