    "intro": "Jacquinia conzattii, commonly known as the Conzatti's bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Jacquinia conzattii is considered a rare and endangered species."
