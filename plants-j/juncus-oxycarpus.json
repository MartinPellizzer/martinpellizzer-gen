    "intro": "Juncus oxycarpus, commonly known as the sharp-fruited rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America. It typically grows in dense stands, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with cylindrical, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil in wetland habitats. Juncus oxycarpus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels."
