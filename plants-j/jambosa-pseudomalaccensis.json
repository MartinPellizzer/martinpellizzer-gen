    "intro": "Jambosa pseudomalaccensis, commonly known as the Malacca jambosa, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia, where it thrives in tropical rainforests. The plant is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. It produces edible fruits that are similar in appearance to those of the common jambosa, though they are less widely consumed. Due to habitat loss, this species is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
