    "intro": "Jorena, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by egg-shaped fruits containing seeds. Jorena is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and agricultural fields. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
