    "intro": "Jurinea prokhanovii var. prokhanovii, commonly known as the Prokhanov's sea bladder, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Arctic and subarctic. It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves and delicate, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand harsh, cold climates. It is often found in maritime environments where it is exposed to strong winds and salt spray. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
