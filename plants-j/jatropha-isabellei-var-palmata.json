It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which give it a distinctive, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into orange-red berries containing toxic seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed or dry habitats. Due to its ornamental value and potential for use in biofuel production, it has been cultivated in various parts of the world."
