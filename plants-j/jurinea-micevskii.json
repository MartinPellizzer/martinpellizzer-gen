    "intro": "Jurinea micevskii, commonly known as the coastal sandgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found along coastal dunes and dry riverbanks. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish in color. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. Jurinea micevskii plays an important role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitat."
