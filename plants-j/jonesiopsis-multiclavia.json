    "intro": "Jonesiopsis multiclavia, commonly known as the clustered clubmoss, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a distinctive, clustered growth pattern of its sporophyte structures. Native to the humid, shaded environments of Southeast Asia, it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soil. The plant exhibits a unique life cycle with a dominant gametophyte stage, typical of many primitive vascular plants. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
