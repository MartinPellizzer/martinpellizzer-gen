    "intro": "Julocroton montevidensis var. pilosus, commonly known as the hairy julocroton, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Uruguay and southern Brazil. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, hairy foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its ornamental value and unique morphology, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
