    "intro": "Jamesonia glandulifera, commonly known as the sticky curling fern, is a perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, curling fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Its leaves are covered in fine, glandular hairs that contribute to its sticky texture. Jamesonia glandulifera thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
