    "intro": "Juniperus rigida subsp. pseudorigida, commonly known as the rigid juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its slow growth rate and hardiness make it a resilient plant in harsh climatic conditions."
