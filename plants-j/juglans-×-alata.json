    "intro": "Juglans \u00d7 alata, commonly known as the winged horse chestnut, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Juglans regia (Persian walnut) and Juglans mandshurica (Manchurian walnut). It is characterized by its distinctive winged fruits, which are elongated and resemble the shape of a horse chestnut. The plant is native to eastern Asia and is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and showy flowers. It thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained, fertile soil. The leaves are palmately compound, typically with 5 to 7 leaflets, and the plant can grow to a height of 10 to 20 meters."
