    "intro": "Juncus confervaceus, commonly known as the green rush, is a flowering plant species belonging to the Juncaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and is often found in wet or marshy environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Juncus confervaceus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in suitable habitats."
