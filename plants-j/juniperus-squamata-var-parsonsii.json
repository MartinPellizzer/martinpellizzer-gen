    "intro": "Juniperus squamata var. parsonsii, commonly known as the Parson's juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its dense, scaly foliage that turns a striking blue-gray color in the winter. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are typically dark blue or black when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
