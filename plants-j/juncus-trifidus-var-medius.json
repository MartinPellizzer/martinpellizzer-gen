    "intro": "Juncus trifidus var. medius, commonly known as the three-lobed rush, is a perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems that often grow in dense clusters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes, streambanks, and damp woodlands. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a distinctive trifid (three-lobed) structure, which is a key identifying feature."
