    "intro": "Juncus bufonius, commonly known as the toad plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, greenish-white flowers in summer. The plant thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Juncus bufonius plays an important ecological role in wetland habitats by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
