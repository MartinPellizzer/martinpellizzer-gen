    "intro": "Jussiaea pterophora, commonly known as the waterwheel plant, is a semi-aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has a distinctive rosette of broad, waxy leaves that help it float on the water's surface. The plant's leaves are often divided into segments that resemble a wheel, aiding in buoyancy and light absorption. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, which are pollinated by insects. Jussiaea pterophora thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes."
