    "intro": "Juniperus mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican juniper, is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which are typically blue-green in color and arranged in spirals around the stems. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for various wildlife species. Juniperus mexicana thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils and in limestone areas. Its slow growth rate and drought tolerance make it a hardy plant well adapted to harsh desert conditions."
