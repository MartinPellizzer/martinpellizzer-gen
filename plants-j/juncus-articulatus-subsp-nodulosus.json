    "intro": "Juncus articulatus subsp. nodulosus, commonly known as the nodular rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its cylindrical, grass-like stems that are often branched and bear small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of tiny, greenish-yellow flowers in spike-like inflorescences, typically during the summer months. Its rhizomes are often nodular, giving the subspecies its common name. This plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
