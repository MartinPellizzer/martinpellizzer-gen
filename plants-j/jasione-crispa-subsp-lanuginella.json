    "intro": "Jasione crispa subsp. lanuginella, commonly known as the downy bellflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and leaves that give it a soft, woolly appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Jasione crispa subsp. lanuginella is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
