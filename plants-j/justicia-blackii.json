    "intro": "Justicia blackii, commonly known as Black's flame flower, is a striking tropical plant native to Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant red bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Justicia blackii is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
