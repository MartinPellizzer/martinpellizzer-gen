    "intro": "Juncus andicola, commonly known as the Andean rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the high Andes of South America. It thrives in wet, mountainous environments and is often found in alpine meadows and near streams. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. Its flowers are small and clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and it reproduces through seeds dispersed by wind. Juncus andicola plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates in its native range."
