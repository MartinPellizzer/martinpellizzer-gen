    "intro": "Josephia bipinnatifida, commonly known as the fringed tree, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like leaves that are bipinnatifid, meaning they are twice-pinnate with finely divided segments. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, adding to its ornamental appeal. Its botanical features make it a unique addition to tropical and subtropical gardens. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
