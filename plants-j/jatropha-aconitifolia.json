    "intro": "Jatropha aconitifolia, commonly known as the death's-head hawkmoth plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically yellow with a distinctive red or orange throat. The plant produces toxic latex, which contains compounds that can be harmful to humans and animals. Its leaves are usually palmate, with five to seven lobes, and it often grows as a shrub or small tree. Jatropha aconitifolia is also known for attracting specific pollinators, including the death's-head hawkmoth, due to its unique floral structure."
