    "intro": "Juncus abortivus, commonly known as the abortive rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America. It typically grows in dense clusters, reaching heights of up to 30 inches, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often reddish or brownish in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional basket-making due to their fibrous nature. Juncus abortivus plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and microorganisms."
