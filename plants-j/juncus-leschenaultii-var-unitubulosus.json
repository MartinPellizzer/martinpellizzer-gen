    "intro": "Juncus leschenaultii var. unitubulosus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that grow in dense clumps, often reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences composed of numerous greenish-yellow flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow, flat, and grass-like, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. This variety is adapted to wet or seasonally moist environments, making it a common sight in marshes, stream banks, and other aquatic habitats."
