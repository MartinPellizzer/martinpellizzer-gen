    "intro": "Justicia nelsonii, commonly known as the Nelson's flamebeard, is a striking flowering plant native to the southern United States. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant red bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than true flowers. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are pollinated by bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a desirable addition to gardens and landscapes."
