    "intro": "Juncus arcticus var. inundatus, commonly known as the water rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and cylindrical spikes of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant thrives in wet or waterlogged soils, often found in tundra and marsh habitats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize open, moist environments effectively. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various arctic invertebrates."
