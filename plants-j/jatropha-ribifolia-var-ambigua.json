It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, often hairy foliage and yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces toxic latex sap, which can cause skin irritation, and its seeds are encased in a fleshy, orange-colored capsule. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and research settings."
