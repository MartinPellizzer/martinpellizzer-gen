    "intro": "Juniperus \u00d7 herragudensis, commonly known as the hybrid juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is a natural hybrid between Juniperus communis and Juniperus oxycedrus, resulting in a plant with distinctive foliage and fruiting characteristics. The leaves are typically needle-like, arranged in whorls, and the plant produces small, blue-black berries that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry environments. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitats."
