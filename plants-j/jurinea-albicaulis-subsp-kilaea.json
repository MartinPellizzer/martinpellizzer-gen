    "intro": "Jurinea albicaulis subsp. kilaea, commonly known as the coastal sandflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the coastal regions of southern Europe and northern Africa. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh maritime conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, helping to reduce water loss. This subspecies is an important part of coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various invertebrates."
