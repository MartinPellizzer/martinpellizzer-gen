    "intro": "Juncus longicaudatus, commonly known as the long-tailed rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that often reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers at the top of its stems, which bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Juncus longicaudatus is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and filter water in aquatic habitats."
