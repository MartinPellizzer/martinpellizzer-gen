It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its flowers are yellow and are surrounded by a ring of pale green leaves, which help in photosynthesis at high altitudes.
