    "intro": "Juncus bulbosus var. salsuginosus, commonly known as the salt marsh rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal and saline environments. It typically grows in wet, saline soils along shorelines and estuaries, exhibiting a robust, grass-like appearance with cylindrical, hollow stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in dense spikes, which are often wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in tidal zones. This variant is adapted to high salinity and fluctuating water levels, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
