    "intro": "Justicia haplostachya, commonly known as the red hot poker or torch flower, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, red bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or yellow, clustered in dense spikes. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which can last several months during the growing season."
