    "intro": "Justicia fasciata, commonly known as the flame flower or red-hot cat's tail, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular red flowers that bloom in dense clusters. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 feet, with lance-shaped leaves that are often variegated. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for tropical gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which can last several months during the warmer seasons."
