It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep red to violet. The plant thrives in sandy soils and can withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to reduce water loss. Jadunia is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties."
