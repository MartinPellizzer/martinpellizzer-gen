    "intro": "Jasminum argyi, commonly known as the Chinese jasmine or winter jasmine, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its fragrant, white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant has opposite, simple, and usually hairy leaves that turn yellow in autumn. Its stems are often covered in a fine, silvery down, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Jasminum argyi is valued in horticulture for its ability to thrive in colder climates and its early blooming habit."
