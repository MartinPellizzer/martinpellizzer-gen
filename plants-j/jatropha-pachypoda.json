    "intro": "Jatropha pachypoda, commonly known as the thick-leaved spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, thick, waxy leaves that are often green with a slight reddish tinge. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds covered in a sticky, toxic substance. Jatropha pachypoda is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and dry forests."
