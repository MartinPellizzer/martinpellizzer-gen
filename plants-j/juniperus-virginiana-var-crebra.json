    "intro": "Juniperus virginiana var. crebra, commonly known as the eastern redcedar, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like foliage that is typically reddish-brown in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to livestock but serve as a food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy plant in woodland and open habitats. Its aromatic wood has historically been used for fence posts and as a source of volatile oils."
