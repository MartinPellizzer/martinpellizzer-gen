    "intro": "Jasione glabrata, commonly known as the smoothleaf jasmine or narrow-leafed jasione, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, smooth leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, blooming in late spring to early summer. Jasione glabrata is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions."
