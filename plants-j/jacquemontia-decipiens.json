    "intro": "Jacquemontia decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as an annual vine, with heart-shaped leaves and a rapid growth habit. Its unique feature is its deceptive appearance, as the flowers resemble those of other species, potentially leading to misidentification. Jacquemontia decipiens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas."
