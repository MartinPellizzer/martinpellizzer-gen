    "intro": "Jussiaea nervosa stirps lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceolate water plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, streams, and wetlands. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a smooth, waxy surface. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikes, producing both male and female parts, making it monoecious. The species is valued for its ecological role in water purification and as a food source for aquatic invertebrates."
