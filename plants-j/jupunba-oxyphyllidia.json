    "intro": "Jupunba oxyphyllidia, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in arid and rocky environments. It belongs to the family Teloschistaceae and is characterized by its crustose growth form, which allows it to adhere tightly to surfaces such as stones and soil. The plant exhibits a pale green to yellowish coloration, with distinct lobes and a finely branched structure. It is capable of surviving in nutrient-poor conditions due to its symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi. Jupunba oxyphyllidia plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other organisms in its ecosystem."
