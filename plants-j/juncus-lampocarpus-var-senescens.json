It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color and covered with fine, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale green to brownish spikelets that are clustered at the top of the stems. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. This variety is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various insects and birds."
