    "intro": "Jurinea catharinae, commonly known as the Catherine's sea rocket, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is native to the coastal regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to the landscape. Jurinea catharinae is often found in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in saline and well-drained conditions."
