    "intro": "Juniperus communis var. stricta, commonly known as the dwarf juniper, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features dense, scale-like foliage that remains green throughout the year, and it produces small, blue-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. The plant is characterized by its slow growth rate and ability to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils. It is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value, particularly in rock gardens and as a border plant. This variety is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of aromatic wood."
