    "intro": "Juniperus communis subsp. brevifolia, commonly known as the dwarf juniper, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value. This subspecies is particularly adapted to harsh climates, making it a resilient choice for rock gardens and coastal areas."
