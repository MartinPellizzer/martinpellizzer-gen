    "intro": "Juncus pelocarpus, commonly known as the narrowleaf rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It typically grows in dense clusters, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with slender, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Juncus pelocarpus plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
