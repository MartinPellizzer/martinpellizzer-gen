    "intro": "Jatropha horizontalis, commonly known as the creeping jatropha, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It features sprawling, low-growing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by bright red, bead-like fruits containing toxic seeds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a distinctive heart-shaped form. Jatropha horizontalis is often found in disturbed soils and is used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil."
