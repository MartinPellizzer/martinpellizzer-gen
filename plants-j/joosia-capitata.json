    "intro": "Joosia capitata, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Joosia capitata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its compact growth habit and long-lasting blooms."
