    "intro": "Juncus trifidus var. sessiliflorus, commonly known as the sessile-flower rush, is a perennial wetland plant characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that are usually greenish or brownish in color. Its leaves are narrow and cylindrical, often with a slightly rough texture. This variety is distinguished by its sessile (short-stemmed) flowers, which are tightly clustered at the tip of the flowering stalk."
