    "intro": "Jacaranda selleana, commonly known as the narrow-leaf jacaranda, is a small to medium-sized tree native to South Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of fragrant, lavender-blue flowers that bloom in spring. The plant belongs to the Bignoniaceae family and is known for its ornamental value in gardens and urban landscapes. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the tree produces small, woody pods containing seeds. Jacaranda selleana thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide shade."
