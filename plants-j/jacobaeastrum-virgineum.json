    "intro": "Jacobaeastrum virgineum, commonly known as the common cudweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and ragworts, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its small, yellowish flowers are surrounded by pale green bracts, and it produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind. Jacobaeastrum virgineum is generally considered a weed but can serve as a food source for certain insects."
