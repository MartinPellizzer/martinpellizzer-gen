    "intro": "Juglans regia var. angulosa, commonly known as the Persian walnut, is a variant of the common walnut native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, angular leaves and robust, deep-rooted growth habit. The plant produces large, edible nuts enclosed in a thick, green husk that splits open when mature. Its wood is highly valued for its strength and fine grain, making it suitable for furniture and carpentry. This variety is adapted to temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
