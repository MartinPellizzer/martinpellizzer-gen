It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of streams. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are usually less than 1 meter in height. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters at the top of the stems. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
