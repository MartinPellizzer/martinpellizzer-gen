    "intro": "Juncus corralensis, commonly known as the coastal rush, is a flowering plant native to the western coast of North America. It is a perennial grass-like plant that typically grows in wet or brackish environments such as tidal marshes and estuaries. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of greenish-white flowers. It has adapted to saline conditions and can tolerate periodic flooding, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil along shorelines."
