    "intro": "Justicia coahuilana, commonly known as the Coahuila flame flower, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, tubular, red-orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in its dry environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
