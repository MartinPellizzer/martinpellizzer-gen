    "intro": "Jasminum floribundum var. decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive jasmine, is a climbing shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often mistaken for true jasmine due to their similar appearance. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface and produces small, elliptical berries that are yellow when ripe. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often used in ornamental gardening. Its deceptive name refers to the plant's ability to mimic other jasmine species, making it difficult to identify without close examination."
