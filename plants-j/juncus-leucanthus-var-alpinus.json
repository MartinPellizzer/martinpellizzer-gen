It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, rocky or alpine environments. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in dense clusters. It is adapted to cold climates and has a compact growth form to withstand harsh weather conditions. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in marginal habitats."
