It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically lobed and have a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that give way to orange-red berries containing toxic seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in partial shade to full sun. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is cultivated in some regions for both aesthetic and practical purposes."
