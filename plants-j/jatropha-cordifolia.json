    "intro": "Jatropha cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf jatropha, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant produces toxic, orange-red berries that contain seeds used in some traditional practices. Jatropha cordifolia is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and riverbanks. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a useful and potentially invasive species in certain environments."
