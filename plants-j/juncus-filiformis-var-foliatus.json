    "intro": "Juncus filiformis var. foliatus, commonly known as the leafy rush, is a variant of the slender rush species native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically longer and more robust compared to the standard variety. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of greenish flowers that are borne on slender stems. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland habitats."
