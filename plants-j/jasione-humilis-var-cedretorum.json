    "intro": "Jasione humilis var. cedretorum, commonly known as Cedret's bentweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It typically forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white to pale blue flowers in early summer. The plant thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as coastal dunes and rocky slopes. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal in garden settings."
