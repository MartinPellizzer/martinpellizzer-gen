    "intro": "Jacquemontia subsalina, commonly known as the saltbush or coastal jacquemontia, is a perennial shrub native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, pale green, oval-shaped leaves that are adapted to tolerate saline and arid conditions. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in sandy or coastal soils. Jacquemontia subsalina is often found in dunes, salt marshes, and other coastal habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small wildlife."
