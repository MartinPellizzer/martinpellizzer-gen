    "intro": "Juncoides nodulosa, commonly known as the nodular rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Juncaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color and covered with small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Juncoides nodulosa is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
