    "intro": "Jussiaea altissima, commonly known as the marsh willow or water willow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found along the edges of ponds, lakes, and streams. The plant features slender, willow-like stems that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in dense clusters and bloom in late spring to early summer. Jussiaea altissima plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic insects and birds."
