Native to regions of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage is a key ornamental feature, making it popular in horticulture for its vibrant and varied leaf patterns. The plant is typically propagated through stem cuttings, which root readily under suitable conditions. Due to its aesthetic appeal, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a potted plant."
