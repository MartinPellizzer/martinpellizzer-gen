    "intro": "Jussiaea oblonga, commonly known as the narrowleaf waterleaf, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland and aquatic environments in South America. It typically grows in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features slender, elongated leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Its small, white flowers are clustered in umbels and bloom during the spring and early summer. Jussiaea oblonga plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
