    "intro": "Juncus kraussii, commonly known as the Cape rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It features dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette at the base. The plant produces tall, cylindrical spikes of small, pale green to yellowish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Juncus kraussii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
