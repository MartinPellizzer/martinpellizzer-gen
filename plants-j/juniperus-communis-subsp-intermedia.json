    "intro": "Juniperus communis subsp. intermedia, commonly known as the common juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with scale-like leaves arranged in flattened sprays. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forest edges, rocky areas, and coastal regions. This subspecies is notable for its aromatic wood and historical use in medicine and as a spice."
