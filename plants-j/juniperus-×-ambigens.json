    "intro": "Juniperus \u00d7 ambigens, commonly known as the hybrid juniper, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a natural hybrid between Juniperus scopulorum and Juniperus horizontalis, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant produces small, scale-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color and shed seasonally. It bears blue-gray berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and small mammals. Juniperus \u00d7 ambigens is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value."
