    "intro": "Jurinea annae, commonly known as the Annae's sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salty and windy environments. It is often found in dune ecosystems, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes. Jurinea annae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
