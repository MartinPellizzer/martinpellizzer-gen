    "intro": "Juniperus sphaerica var. pseudomas, commonly known as the globe juniper, is a compact, spherical shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, needle-like foliage that is typically blue-green in color, providing a striking visual contrast against its rugged habitat. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and xeriscapes. Due to its slow growth and unique form, it is highly valued in horticulture for ornamental purposes."
