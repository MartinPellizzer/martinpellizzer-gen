    "intro": "Juncus biflorus, commonly known as the two-flowered rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the Juncaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like, cylindrical stems that grow in dense clumps. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in two clusters at the top of each stem. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation in moist soils. Juncus biflorus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
