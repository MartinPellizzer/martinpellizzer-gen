It is characterized by its robust, upright stems and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to violet. The plant has lance-shaped, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair, aiding in water retention. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.
