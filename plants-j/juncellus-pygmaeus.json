    "intro": "Juncellus pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf rush, is a small herbaceous plant belonging to the Juncaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, grass-like appearance with narrow, cylindrical leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in height. This plant thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and the edges of ponds. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing tiny, three-lobed capsules that contain the seeds. Juncellus pygmaeus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
