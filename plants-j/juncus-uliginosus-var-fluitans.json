    "intro": "Juncus uliginosus var. fluitans, commonly known as floating rush, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems that often float on the surface of still or slow-moving water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in spike-like clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. This variant is adapted to nutrient-rich, muddy substrates and is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes."
