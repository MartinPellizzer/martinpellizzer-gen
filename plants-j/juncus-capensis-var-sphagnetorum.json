    "intro": "Juncus capensis var. sphagnetorum, commonly known as the marsh rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and damp soils, where it forms dense, grass-like clusters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters at the ends of its stems. It is adapted to waterlogged conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems. Its ability to thrive in acidic and nutrient-poor environments makes it an important component of peat-forming habitats."
