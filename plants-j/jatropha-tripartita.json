    "intro": "Jatropha tripartita, commonly known as the three-parted physic nut, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets, and its clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain toxic seeds, which are covered in a sticky, resinous substance. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in arid conditions. Due to its toxic properties, it is not suitable for cultivation for human or livestock consumption."
