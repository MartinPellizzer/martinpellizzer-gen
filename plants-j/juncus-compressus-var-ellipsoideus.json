It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often crowded together, forming dense clusters. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This variety is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
