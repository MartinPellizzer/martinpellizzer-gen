It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in height. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are usually greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, or along the edges of ponds. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ability to add texture and interest to moist environments."
