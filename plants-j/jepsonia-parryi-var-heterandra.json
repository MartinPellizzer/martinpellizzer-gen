    "intro": "Jepsonia parryi var. heterandra, commonly known as Parry's jepsonia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the southwestern United States. It is a perennial herb characterized by its small, clustered leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant thrives in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying plant adaptation and conservation. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in some regions."
