    "intro": "Juncus macrocephalus, commonly known as the large-headed rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It features tall, cylindrical stems that are typically unbranched and covered in stiff, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense, spike-like clusters at the top of the stems. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland habitats. Juncus macrocephalus plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, including insects and birds."
