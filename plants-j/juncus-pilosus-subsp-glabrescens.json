    "intro": "Juncus pilosus subsp. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth rush, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems that are typically smooth and hairless, distinguishing it from other rush species. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in dense clusters at the ends of its stems, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms."
