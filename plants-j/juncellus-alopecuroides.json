    "intro": "Juncellus alopecuroides, commonly known as the woolly rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland edges and rocky habitats. The plant features slender, cylindrical stems that are often covered in dense, soft, white or grayish hairs. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are borne in spike-like clusters, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Juncellus alopecuroides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in partially shaded environments."
