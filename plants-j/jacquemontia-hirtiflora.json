    "intro": "Jacquemontia hirtiflora, commonly known as the hairy-flowered morning glory, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves and produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or wetland habitats. Its flowers bloom in the early morning, hence its common name, and are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting local pollinator populations."
