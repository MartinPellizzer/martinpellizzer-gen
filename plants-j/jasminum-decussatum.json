    "intro": "Jasminum decussatum, commonly known as the Indian jasmine or wild jasmine, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, elliptical leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, usually white or yellow, which bloom in the spring and summer. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Jasminum decussatum is often found in forest understories and along riverbanks, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat."
