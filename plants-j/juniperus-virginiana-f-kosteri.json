    "intro": "Juniperus virginiana f. kosteri, commonly known as the Koster juniper, is a compact, shrub-like form of the eastern red cedar. It features dense, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, providing a striking contrast to its reddish-brown bark. This form is naturally occurring and is often found in dry, rocky soils across the southeastern United States. It is highly valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are an important food source for wildlife."
