    "intro": "Juniperus capensis, commonly known as the Capejuniper, is a hardy evergreen shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like foliage that is typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for various wildlife. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Juniperus capensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in horticulture for its drought tolerance and winter interest."
