    "intro": "Juno galatica, commonly known as the celestial orchid, is a rare and exotic flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue petals that resemble the night sky, and its delicate, fragrant blossoms appear during the cooler months. The plant thrives in well-drained, nutrient-rich soils and requires ample sunlight to flourish. Its unique morphology includes a slender stem and a single, showy flower that blooms once a year. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, Juno galatica is considered a symbol of resilience and beauty in botanical circles."
