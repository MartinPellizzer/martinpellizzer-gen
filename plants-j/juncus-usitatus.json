    "intro": "Juncus usitatus, commonly known as common rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. The plant has cylindrical, grass-like stems that are often densely packed and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Its narrow leaves are usually dark green and lack true roots, instead relying on rhizomes for nutrient absorption. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in spike-like clusters, and are pollinated by wind."
