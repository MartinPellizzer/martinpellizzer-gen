    "intro": "Jupunba gallorum, commonly known as the red sandalwood tree, is a species native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain several seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a smooth, waxy surface. Due to overharvesting, Jupunba gallorum is now classified as an endangered species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
