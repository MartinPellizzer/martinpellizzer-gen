    "intro": "Juncus bulbosus f. geniculatus, commonly known as the geniculate rush, is a variant of the bulbous rush characterized by its distinctive, spiraling growth pattern. It is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of white or pale green flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
