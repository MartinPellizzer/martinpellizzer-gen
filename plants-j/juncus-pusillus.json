    "intro": "Juncus pusillus, commonly known as the dwarf rush, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often forming dense mats that help stabilize the surrounding ecosystem. The plant has slender, grass-like stems that are usually less than 10 centimeters tall, with small, spike-like clusters of flowers at the tips. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slight waxy coating to reduce water loss. Juncus pusillus plays an important role in wetland habitats by providing habitat for aquatic insects and serving as a food source for various wildlife."
