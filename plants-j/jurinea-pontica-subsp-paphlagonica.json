    "intro": "Jurinea pontica subsp. paphlagonica, commonly known as the Paphlagonian sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Black Sea. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky coastal habitats, where it thrives in saline and well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to coastal environments."
