    "intro": "Jugastrum depressum, commonly known as the low junegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats. Jugastrum depressum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small wildlife in its native range."
