    "intro": "Juncus articulatus var. maritimus, commonly known as saltmarsh rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions. It thrives in saline and brackish wetlands, often found in marshes and tidal areas. The plant has cylindrical, grass-like stems that are often segmented and covered in fine, hair-like structures. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically clustered in spikes at the top of the stems. This variety is adapted to withstand salt spray and periodic flooding, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
