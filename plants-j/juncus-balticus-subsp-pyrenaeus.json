    "intro": "Juncus balticus subsp. pyrenaeus, commonly known as the Pyrenean rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks, wet meadows, and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense spikes during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
