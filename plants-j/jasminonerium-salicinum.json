It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often emitting a sweet, honey-like scent. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Jasminonerium salicinum is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its historical use in traditional medicine."
