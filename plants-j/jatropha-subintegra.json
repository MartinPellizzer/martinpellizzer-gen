    "intro": "Jatropha subintegra, commonly known as the Mexican physic nut, is a shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by capsules containing toxic seeds. It is known for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine, though its parts are generally poisonous. Jatropha subintegra is also studied for potential use in biofuel production due to its oil-rich seeds."
