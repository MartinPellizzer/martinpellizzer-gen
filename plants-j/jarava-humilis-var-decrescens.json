    "intro": "Jarava humilis var. decrescens, commonly known as the dwarf jarava, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically forms dense mats of fine, silver-gray leaves that are adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in summer, which are clustered in spikelets. It is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and ecological importance in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
