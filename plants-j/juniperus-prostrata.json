    "intro": "Juniperus prostrata, commonly known as creeping juniper, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically forms dense mats or low bushes, with scale-like leaves that are tightly pressed against the stems. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value. Juniperus prostrata is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in rocky or arid environments."
