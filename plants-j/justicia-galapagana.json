    "intro": "Justicia galapagana, commonly known as the Gal\u00e1pagos flame flower, is a flowering plant native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to the arid climate of the region. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are usually bright red or orange, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, and it has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to the biodiversity of the Gal\u00e1pagos ecosystem."
