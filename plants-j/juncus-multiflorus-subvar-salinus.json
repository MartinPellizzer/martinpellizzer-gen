    "intro": "Juncus multiflorus subvar. salinus, commonly known as the salt marsh rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to coastal areas of North America. It thrives in brackish or saline wetlands, often found in tidal marshes and estuaries. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are typically green to reddish in color, and it produces small, clustered spikes of white or pale green flowers. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in coastal environments. This subspecies is adapted to withstand periodic flooding and high salinity levels, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
