    "intro": "Jurinea radians, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Jurinea radians is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
