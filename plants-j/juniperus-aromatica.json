    "intro": "Juniperus aromatica, commonly known as the fragrant juniper, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color and emit a subtle, aromatic scent. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are often used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent. Juniperus aromatica thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rocky or alpine environments. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
