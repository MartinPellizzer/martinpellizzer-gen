    "intro": "Juglans californica subsp. hindsii, commonly known as the Hinds' black walnut, is a subspecies native to the western United States. It is characterized by its large, dark green leaves with a serrated margin and its distinctive, edible, walnut-shaped seeds. The tree produces a heavy, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its strength and workability. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and mountainous regions. The subspecies is closely related to other walnut species but is distinguished by its unique geographic distribution and morphological features."
