    "intro": "Josephia sclerophylla, commonly known as the coastal rock heath, is a perennial shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal sage scrub habitats. Due to its resilience and unique adaptations, it plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local wildlife."
