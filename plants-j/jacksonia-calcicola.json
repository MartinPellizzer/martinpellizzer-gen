It is a small, perennial shrub that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with white centers, which bloom in spring. It has hairy, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Jacksonia calcicola is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to low-nutrient environments."
