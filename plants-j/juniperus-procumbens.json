    "intro": "Juniperus procumbens, commonly known as creeping juniper, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to eastern Asia. It features scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, arranged in dense, flat sprays. The plant produces small, spherical blue or black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in horticulture for its hardiness and ornamental value. Juniperus procumbens is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in rocky or sandy environments."
