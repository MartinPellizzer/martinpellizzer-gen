    "intro": "Justicia parviflora, commonly known as the smallflowered glorybower, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring upright stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink or red, depending on the variety. These flowers are arranged in terminal spikes and are pollinated primarily by birds, especially hummingbirds. Justicia parviflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in full sun to partial shade."
