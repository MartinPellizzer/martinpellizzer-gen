    "intro": "Jamesonia elongata, commonly known as the eastern false hellebore, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features a rosette of dark green, waxy leaves that are broadly ovate with a smooth margin. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady woodland habitats and has a long, creeping rhizome. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
