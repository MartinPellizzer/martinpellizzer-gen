It is characterized by its striking, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a slight pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners in warm climates.
