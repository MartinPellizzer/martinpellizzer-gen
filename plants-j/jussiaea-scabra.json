    "intro": "Jussiaea scabra, commonly known as the rough jussiaea, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, preferring moist and nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture, and it produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds. Jussiaea scabra is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland areas."
