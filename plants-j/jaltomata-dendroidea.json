    "intro": "Jaltomata dendroidea, commonly known as the tree morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is a woody vine that can grow up to several meters in height, featuring dense foliage and striking violet to purple flowers. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its ornamental value and unique morphology, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
