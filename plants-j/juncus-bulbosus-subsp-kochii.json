    "intro": "Juncus bulbosus subsp. kochii, commonly known as the bulbous rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. The plant has cylindrical, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of greenish or brownish flowers. It is characterized by its bulbous base, which stores nutrients and helps it survive in fluctuating water conditions. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various organisms."
