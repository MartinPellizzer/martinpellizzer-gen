    "intro": "Juno svetlanae, commonly known as the Svetlana's Juno, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet petals and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant blooms in late spring, producing clusters of small, fragrant flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Juno svetlanae is considered a vulnerable species."
