    "intro": "Juncus articulatus subsp. aquaticus, commonly known as the water rush, is a perennial wetland plant characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. This species is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
