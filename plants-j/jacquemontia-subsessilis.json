It features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant blooms in late spring to early summer, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, kidney-shaped seeds.
