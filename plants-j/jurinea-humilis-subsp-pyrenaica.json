    "intro": "Jurinea humilis subsp. pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Iberian Peninsula and southern France. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are succulent and often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is adapted to harsh, arid environments and is considered a characteristic species of Mediterranean and Atlantic biomes."
