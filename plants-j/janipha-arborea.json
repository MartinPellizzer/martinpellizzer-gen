    "intro": "Janipha arborea, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and lance-shaped leaves that are alternate and leathery in texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by round, woody fruits containing smooth, black seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal forests and sandy soils. Due to its aromatic properties, it has been traditionally used in perfumery and traditional medicine."
