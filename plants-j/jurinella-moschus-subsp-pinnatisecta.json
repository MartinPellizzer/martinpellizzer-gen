    "intro": "Jurinella moschus subsp. pinnatisecta, commonly known as the fragrant pinnatisect fern, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bioluminescent fronds that emit a subtle, sweet fragrance, especially at night. The plant features a creeping rhizome with lanceolate, pinnatisect leaves that are finely divided, giving it a lacy appearance. Its unique scent is attributed to volatile compounds produced in its leaves, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. This rare fern is often found in shaded, moist forest understories where it thrives in humid, tropical environments."
