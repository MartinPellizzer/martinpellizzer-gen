    "intro": "Jacaima costata, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood and distinctive, wavy grain patterns. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by elongated, woody fruits containing several seeds. Due to its valuable timber, Jacaima costata is also considered a threatened species in its native habitat."
