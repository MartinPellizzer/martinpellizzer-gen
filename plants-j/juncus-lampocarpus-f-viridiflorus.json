    "intro": "Juncus lampocarpus f. viridiflorus, commonly known as the green-flowered rush, is a variant of the common rush species native to coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and slender, cylindrical stems that grow in clusters. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, which are typically found at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in dune environments. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
