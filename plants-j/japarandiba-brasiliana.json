    "intro": "Japarandiba brasiliana, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood with a rich, reddish-brown color and a fine, even texture. The plant has compound leaves with long, narrow leaflets and produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruits are woody capsules containing several seeds. Due to its high value for musical instruments and its endangered status, conservation efforts are critical for its survival."
