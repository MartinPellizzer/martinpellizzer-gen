    "intro": "Juncus paniculatus subsp. depauperatus, commonly known as the sparse bulrush, is a herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and cylindrical spikes of small, greenish flowers. It is typically found in wetland habitats, including marshes and the edges of ponds, where it thrives in saturated soils. The plant has a robust root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its flowers are usually unisexual, with separate male and female structures, and it relies on wind pollination. This subspecies is notable for its reduced floral structures compared to other members of the Juncus genus."
