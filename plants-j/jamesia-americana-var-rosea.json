    "intro": "Jamesia americana var. rosea, commonly known as the roseleaf painted scale, is a rare and striking plant native to the western United States. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its showy, pink to rose-colored flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that provide a delicate contrast to its vibrant blossoms. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in specialty gardens."
