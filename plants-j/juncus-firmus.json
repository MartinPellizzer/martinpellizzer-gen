    "intro": "Juncus firmus, commonly known as the stiff rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in North America. It has tall, cylindrical stems that are typically green to reddish in color, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters near the top of the stems. The plant is characterized by its dense, fibrous roots that help stabilize soil in marshy areas. Juncus firmus thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. Its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
