    "intro": "Juncus uniflorus, commonly known as the single-flower rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces a single, upright flower spike in late summer. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. Its narrow leaves are typically bright green and can grow up to several feet in height. Juncus uniflorus plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
