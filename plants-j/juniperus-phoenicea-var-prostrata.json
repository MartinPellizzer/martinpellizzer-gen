    "intro": "Juniperus phoenicea var. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate juniper, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, providing a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact form and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for landscaping in arid and semi-arid climates."
