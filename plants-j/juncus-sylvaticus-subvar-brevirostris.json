    "intro": "Juncus sylvaticus subvar. brevirostris, commonly known as the narrow-beak rush, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically green to blue-green in color. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually brown or reddish-brown, emerging from the upper part of the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other wet or damp habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
