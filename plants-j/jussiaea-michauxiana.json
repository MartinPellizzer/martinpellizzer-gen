    "intro": "Jussiaea michauxiana, commonly known as the marsh willow or river willow, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows near water, such as along riverbanks or in marshes. The plant has slender, willow-like branches and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slight waxy coating to help retain moisture. Jussiaea michauxiana is adapted to waterlogged soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
