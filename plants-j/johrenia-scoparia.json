    "intro": "Johrenia scoparia, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with silver-gray, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy seed heads that disperse seeds via the wind. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions. Johrenia scoparia is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes."
