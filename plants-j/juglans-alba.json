    "intro": "Juglans alba, commonly known as the white walnut, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, lobed leaves and distinctive, spiny husks that encase its edible nuts. The tree produces both male and female flowers, with the male flowers being catkin-like and the female flowers solitary. Its bark is thick, furrowed, and often has a whitish or grayish color. The white walnut is valued for its timber and its nuts, which are used in cooking and traditional medicine."
