    "intro": "Juglans alba minima, commonly known as the white walnut dwarf, is a small, deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the Juglandaceae family, which includes other walnut and hickory species. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves with lance-shaped leaflets and small, edible nuts enclosed in a husk. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a temperate climate with adequate sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
