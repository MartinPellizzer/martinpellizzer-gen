    "intro": "Jussiaea jussiaeoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water primrose, is a semi-aquatic plant native to South America. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of freshwater bodies. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are usually submerged or floating, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. Its small white flowers bloom in clusters, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Jussiaea jussiaeoides is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich waters and is sometimes used in aquatic gardening."
