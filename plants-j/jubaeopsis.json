    "intro": "Jubaeopsis, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It consists of several species, primarily native to southern Africa, where they thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plants are characterized by their succulent leaves and often have a milky sap, which can be toxic. Jubaeopsis species are typically shrubs or small trees, with some varieties reaching heights of up to three meters. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated as houseplants due to their unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
