    "intro": "Juniperus virginiana var. australis, commonly known as the eastern redcedar, is a shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and small, berry-like cones that mature to a bright red color. The plant has scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces male and female cones on separate plants. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and adaptable species. The eastern redcedar is also known for its use in landscaping and its historical importance in Native American cultures."
