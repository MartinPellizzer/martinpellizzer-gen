It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, succulent leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert or steppe environments. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
