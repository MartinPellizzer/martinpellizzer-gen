    "intro": "Justicia trianae, commonly known as the flame flower, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. It prefers well-drained soil and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. Justicia trianae is also valued for its ability to tolerate drought conditions once established."
