    "intro": "Juncus pyrenaicus, commonly known as the Pyrenean rush, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and southern France. It typically grows in moist, rocky habitats such as stream banks and mountain meadows. The plant has slender, grass-like stems that are often reddish in color and produce small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, contributing to its overall rush-like appearance. Juncus pyrenaicus plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment and is often found in high-altitude ecosystems."
