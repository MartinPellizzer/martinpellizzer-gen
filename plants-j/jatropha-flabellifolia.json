    "intro": "Jatropha flabellifolia, commonly known as the fan-leaf jatropha, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that give it a distinctive, fan-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that are followed by orange or red berries containing toxic seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and potential ecological uses, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
