    "intro": "Justicia eranthemoides, commonly known as the velvetleaf false dragonhead, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
