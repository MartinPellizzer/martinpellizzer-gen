It is characterized by its hairy, often glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Justicia cleomoides is also known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative means."
