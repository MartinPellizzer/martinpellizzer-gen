It is characterized by its dark, ridged bark and alternate, pinnately compound leaves with doubly serrate margins. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by edible, round, green fruits that mature into hard-shelled nuts. Its seeds are valued for their rich oils and are used in both culinary and industrial applications. This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
