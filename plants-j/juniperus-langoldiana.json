    "intro": "Juniperus langoldiana, commonly known as the Langold juniper, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage and small, blue-gray berries that are typically retained on the plant for several years. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. It has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 5 meters. Juniperus langoldiana is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in horticulture for its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal."
