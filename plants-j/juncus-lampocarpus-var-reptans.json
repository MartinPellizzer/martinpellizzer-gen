    "intro": "Juncus lampocarpus var. reptans, commonly known as the creeping rush, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife. The leaves are typically narrow and cylindrical, with a bluish-green coloration that helps distinguish it from other rush species."
