    "intro": "Jossinia costenoblei, commonly known as the Costenoble's jossia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within humid forests, often near streams or in rocky crevices. Its unique botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss."
