    "intro": "Juncus pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf rush, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bright green or reddish in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils, making it a common sight in marshes, wetlands, and along stream banks. Juncus pumilus is valued in ecological restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
