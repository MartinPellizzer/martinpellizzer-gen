    "intro": "Jatropha grossidentata, commonly known as the Mexican physic nut, is a shrub native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs, and its yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that contain toxic seeds, making it a potential hazard to livestock and humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dry forests. Due to its toxicity, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
