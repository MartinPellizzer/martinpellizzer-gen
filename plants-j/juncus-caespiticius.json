    "intro": "Juncus caespiticius, commonly known as the tufted rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It features dense, grass-like foliage that grows in compact clumps, with slender, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters near the base of the stems, typically in late spring or early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation, which helps stabilize soil and filter water. Juncus caespiticius is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
