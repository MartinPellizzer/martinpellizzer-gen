It features scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, providing a striking visual contrast against its dark purple to black stems. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are typically blue or purple, containing toxic seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a ground cover. This variety is known for its hardiness and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
