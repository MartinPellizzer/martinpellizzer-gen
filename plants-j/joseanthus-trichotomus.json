    "intro": "Joseanthus trichotomus, commonly known as the three-branched flax, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, delicate blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude regions. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
