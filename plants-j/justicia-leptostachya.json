    "intro": "Justicia leptostachya, commonly known as the flame flower or red flame plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually hairy and covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Justicia leptostachya is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in warm climates."
