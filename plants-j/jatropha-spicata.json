    "intro": "Jatropha spicata, commonly known as the spiny jatropha, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its sparsely branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by orange-red berries containing toxic seeds. Jatropha spicata is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in semi-arid conditions. Its toxic properties make it a cautionary plant in many regions."
