    "intro": "Jacea rarauensis, commonly known as the rare alpine bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant has lanceolate leaves with hairy surfaces, adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Jacea rarauensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
