    "intro": "Janakia, commonly known as the sacred lotus of ancient India, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Nymphaeaceae. These plants are characterized by their floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface. Janakia species are typically found in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes. They play an important role in traditional medicine and cultural practices in South and Southeast Asia. The plant's ability to thrive in still waters makes it a valuable indicator of water quality."
