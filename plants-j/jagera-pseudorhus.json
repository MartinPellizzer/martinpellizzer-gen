    "intro": "Jagera pseudorhus, commonly known as the silky oak, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia. It belongs to the Proteaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and broad, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, followed by woody, cone-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and along riverbanks. The silky oak is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional Aboriginal practices."
