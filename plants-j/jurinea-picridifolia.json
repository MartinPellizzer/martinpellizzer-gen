    "intro": "Jurinea picridifolia, commonly known as the coastal bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial with small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of blue or violet. The plant has silver-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal areas and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Jurinea picridifolia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
