    "intro": "Jasione montana subsp. depressa, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically reaches a height of 5\u201315 cm and features a mat-forming growth habit with fleshy, basal leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to purple, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and alpine settings."
