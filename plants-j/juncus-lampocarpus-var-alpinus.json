    "intro": "Juncus lampocarpus var. alpinus, commonly known as the alpine rush, is a perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
