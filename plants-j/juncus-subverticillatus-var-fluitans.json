    "intro": "Juncus subverticillatus var. fluitans, commonly known as the floating rush, is a wetland plant characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that grow in dense clusters. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikes, contributing to its overall structure. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation, which helps stabilize aquatic environments. This variety is adapted to fluctuating water levels, making it a resilient species in dynamic wetland habitats."
