It features a rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes or dry grasslands. Its botanical structure is adapted to withstand harsh, dry conditions, making it a resilient member of its ecosystem."
