    "intro": "Juncus limosus, commonly known as swamp rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually green to reddish in color. Its cylindrical, spike-like inflorescence bears small, three-lobed flowers that are wind-pollinated. Juncus limosus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
