    "intro": "Juncus glaucus subsp. depauperatus, commonly known as the slender rush, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish flowers in dense spikes. This subspecies is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils with low moisture levels. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small insects and animals. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
