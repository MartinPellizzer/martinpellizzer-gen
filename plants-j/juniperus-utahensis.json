    "intro": "Juniperus utahensis, commonly known as Utah juniper, is a hardy evergreen shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its scale-like leaves and small, blue-gray berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and wildlife. The plant is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well adapted to desert and semi-arid environments. Its compact growth habit and ability to withstand extreme temperatures make it a popular choice for landscaping in dry climates. The Utah juniper plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various desert species."
