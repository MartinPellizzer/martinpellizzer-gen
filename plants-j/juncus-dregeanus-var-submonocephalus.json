    "intro": "Juncus dregeanus var. submonocephalus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, cylindrical leaves that are often slightly hairy, and its flowering spikes are usually unbranched, bearing small, greenish-white flowers. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. This variant is distinguished by its reduced number of flowering heads compared to other varieties of Juncus dregeanus."
