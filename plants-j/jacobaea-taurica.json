    "intro": "Jacobaea taurica, commonly known as the Crimean tansy, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange composite flowers and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across arid regions. Jacobaea taurica is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
