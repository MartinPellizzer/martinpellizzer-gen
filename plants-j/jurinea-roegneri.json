    "intro": "Jurinea roegneri, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure adapted to harsh, sandy environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight. Jurinea roegneri is well-suited to extreme drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat."
