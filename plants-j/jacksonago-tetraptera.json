    "intro": "Jacksonago tetraptera, commonly known as the four-winged cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, compound leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants due to their striking appearance. However, it is considered endangered due to habitat loss and over-collection."
