    "intro": "Jacquinia indica, commonly known as the narrowleaf wintergreen, is a flowering plant native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are typically narrow and leathery, while its flowers are white or pale pink, appearing in late winter to early spring. Jacquinia indica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators during the early growing season."
