    "intro": "Juncus nodulosus f. uniceps, commonly known as the single-headed rush, is a variant of the nodular rush characterized by its unique growth habit. It is a perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments, typically found in temperate regions. The plant features tall, cylindrical stems that are often hairless and have a smooth, grass-like appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a single, dense spike of small, three-lobed flowers, which distinguishes it from other juncus species. This form is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
