    "intro": "Juncus lampocarpus f. nigrescens, commonly known as the black-stemmed rush, is a variant of the common rush species native to coastal regions of California. It is a perennial plant characterized by its dark, almost black stems that contrast with its green, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and tidal areas, where it thrives in brackish or freshwater conditions. Its flowering spikes produce small, clustered brown flowers that are adapted for wind pollination. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
