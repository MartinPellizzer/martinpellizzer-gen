    "intro": "Juglans sulcata, commonly known as the Turkish walnut, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Turkey and the Caucasus. It is characterized by its large, doubly serrated leaves and produces edible, walnut-like fruits that are encased in a thick, green husk. The tree has a straight trunk with a broad, rounded crown and can grow up to 20 meters in height. Its wood is dense and strong, making it valuable for construction and furniture-making. The plant is also cultivated for its ornamental value and for the edible seeds it produces."
