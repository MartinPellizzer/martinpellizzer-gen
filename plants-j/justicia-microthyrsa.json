    "intro": "Justicia microthyrsa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flame flower, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking, tubular red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes in warm climates."
