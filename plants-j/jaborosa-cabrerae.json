It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions of its native habitat. Its flowers are usually small and yellow, arranged in a compact cluster, and it produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Jaborosa cabrerae is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological significance in its ecosystem."
