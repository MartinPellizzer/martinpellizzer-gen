    "intro": "Jovibarba globifera subsp. lagariniana, commonly known as the Alpine stonecress, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and fleshy, succulent leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is cultivated in rock gardens and alpine gardens worldwide."
