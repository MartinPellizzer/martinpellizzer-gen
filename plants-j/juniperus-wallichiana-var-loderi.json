    "intro": "Juniperus wallichiana var. loderi, commonly known as the Loder's juniper, is a variety of the Chinese juniper native to the Himalayas. It is a small evergreen shrub or tree characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and needle-like leaves. The foliage is typically bluish-green, with small, scale-like leaves that are closely packed along the branches. It produces small, round blue-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and small mammals. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils."
