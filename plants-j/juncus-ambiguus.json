    "intro": "Juncus ambiguus, commonly known as the common rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments across North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and cylindrical, spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and hollow, with a fibrous texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers. Juncus ambiguus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
