    "intro": "Jarava academica, commonly known as the academic jarava, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. Jarava academica is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open fields and along coastal areas."
