    "intro": "Juncus laxus, commonly known as the soft rush, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like stems that are often slightly curved and can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its small, spike-like inflorescence consists of numerous tiny, three-lobed flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Juncus laxus plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various insects and waterfowl."
