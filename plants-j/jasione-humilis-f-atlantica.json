    "intro": "Jasione humilis f. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic Jasione, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Iberian Peninsula and parts of North Africa. It features small, clustered blue or purple flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence, aiding in water retention. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is typically found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
