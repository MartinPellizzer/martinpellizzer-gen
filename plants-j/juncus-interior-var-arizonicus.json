    "intro": "Juncus interior var. arizonicus, commonly known as Arizona rush, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Juncaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and cylindrical flower clusters. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded soils, often found in marshes, swales, and riparian zones. Its narrow leaves are usually bright green and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The flowers, which appear in late spring to early summer, are small and pale green, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
