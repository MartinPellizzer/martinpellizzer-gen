It is characterized by its pale white petals that emit a subtle glow in low light conditions, giving it its common name. The plant has a slender, upright stem with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy. Its flowers bloom in late spring and are pollinated primarily by nocturnal moths. Jirawongsea alba is highly valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
