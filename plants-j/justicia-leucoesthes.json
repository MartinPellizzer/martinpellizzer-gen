    "intro": "Justicia leucoesthes, commonly known as white flame or white flameplant, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white, yellow, and red, which bloom throughout the year in warm climates. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
