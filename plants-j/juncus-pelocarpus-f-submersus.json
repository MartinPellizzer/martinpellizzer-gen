This plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. Its stems are often fully submerged, with reduced leaves that are adapted for underwater conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are arranged in spikelets, typical of the Juncaceae family. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing aquatic sediments and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
