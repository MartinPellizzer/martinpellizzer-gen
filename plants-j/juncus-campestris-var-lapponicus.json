    "intro": "Juncus campestris var. lapponicus, commonly known as the Lapland rush, is a perennial plant native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its stiff, grass-like stems that grow close to the ground, often forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in spike-like clusters during the summer months. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, bogs, and along the edges of lakes. Its adaptability to cold climates makes it an important component of tundra and boreal ecosystems."
