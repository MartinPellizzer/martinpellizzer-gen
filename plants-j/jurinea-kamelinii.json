    "intro": "Jurinea kamelinii, commonly known as the Kamelin's\u7ee2\u82b1, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, woolly leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. Its growth is typically low and spreading, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Jurinea kamelinii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
