    "intro": "Juncus nemorosus, commonly known as the wood rush, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Juncaceae and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage composed of narrow, cylindrical leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces small, greenish or brownish flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Juncus nemorosus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate wet conditions."
