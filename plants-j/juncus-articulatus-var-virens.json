    "intro": "Juncus articulatus var. virens, commonly known as the green rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features tall, cylindrical stems that are segmented and often have a fibrous texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in spike-like clusters at the tips of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically growing in dense clumps. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils."
