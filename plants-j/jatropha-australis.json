    "intro": "Jatropha australis, commonly known as the coastal jatropha, is a flowering plant native to Australia and New Zealand. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright orange or red berries containing toxic seeds. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating. Jatropha australis is adapted to tolerate salt spray and arid conditions, making it a hardy species in coastal ecosystems."
