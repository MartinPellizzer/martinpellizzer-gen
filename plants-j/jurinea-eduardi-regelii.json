    "intro": "Jurinea eduardi-regelii, commonly known as the desert sandflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in the spring, and it produces fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds for reproduction. Jurinea eduardi-regelii plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in desert and steppe ecosystems."
