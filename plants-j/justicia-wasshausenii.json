It features striking silver-gray foliage that provides a dramatic contrast to its bright orange-red flowers. The plant produces clusters of tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
