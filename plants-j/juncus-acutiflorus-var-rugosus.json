    "intro": "Juncus acutiflorus var. rugosus, commonly known as the rough-flowered rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves and its spikes of small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often in marshes, pond edges, or along stream banks. Its rough, textured leaves give it its scientific name, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its adaptability and ecological benefits."
