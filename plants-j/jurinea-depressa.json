    "intro": "Jurinea depressa, commonly known as the flat sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that often form dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. Jurinea depressa is typically found in sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or inland dunes."
