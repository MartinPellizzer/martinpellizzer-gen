    "intro": "Johrenia tenuissima, commonly known as the slender lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its narrow, strap-like leaves and delicate, pale pink to white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its botanical features include a short stem and a single, showy bloom that appears in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Johrenia tenuissima is considered a vulnerable species."
