    "intro": "Jansenella neglecta, commonly known as the neglected jansenella, is a small, herbaceous plant native to specific regions of South America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features slender, upright stems with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in dense inflorescences, and are typically white or pale green in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Jansenella neglecta is considered a rare and understudied species in botanical research."
