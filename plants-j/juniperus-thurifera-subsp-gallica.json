    "intro": "Juniperus thurifera subsp. gallica, commonly known as the Galician juniper, is a subspecies of the juniper shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and produces blue-black berries that are often used in traditional medicine and as a spice. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. It is a dioecious species, meaning male and female reproductive structures are found on separate plants. Its botanical features make it an important component of the local flora and ecological systems."
