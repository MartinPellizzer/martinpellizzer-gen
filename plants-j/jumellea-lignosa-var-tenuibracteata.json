    "intro": "Jumellea lignosa var. tenuibracteata, commonly known as the slender-bract jumellea, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its flowering period usually occurs during the rainy season, and it is adapted to thrive in poor, sandy soils. The varietal form, tenuibracteata, is distinguished by its slender bracts that enclose the flowers, giving it a unique appearance."
