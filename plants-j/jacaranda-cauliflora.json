    "intro": "Jacaranda cauliflora, commonly known as the sweet jacaranda, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bignoniaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its showy, pendulous clusters of violet or purple flowers. The plant produces its flowers and fruits directly on the trunk and branches, a growth pattern known as cauliflorous. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate, with a slightly hairy texture. The sweet jacaranda is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is popular in tropical and subtropical regions."
