    "intro": "Justicia procumbens var. bonneyana, commonly known as the Bonney's spreadleaf, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features spreading stems that often root at the nodes, forming a dense mat of foliage. The plant produces clusters of showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
