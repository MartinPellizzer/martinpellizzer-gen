    "intro": "Juncus squarrosus var. glomeratus, commonly known as the clustered rush, is a flowering plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the family Juncaceae and is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in spikes, which are often clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. This variant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
