    "intro": "Juncus lomatophyllus, commonly known as the mountain rush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the family Juncaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats such as stream banks and mountain slopes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the inflorescence consists of dense clusters of tiny, spike-like flowers. Juncus lomatophyllus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in wetland environments."
