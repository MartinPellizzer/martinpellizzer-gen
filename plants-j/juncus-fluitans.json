It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems that grow in dense clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. Its roots help stabilize aquatic soils and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. Juncus fluitans is often found in ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams."
