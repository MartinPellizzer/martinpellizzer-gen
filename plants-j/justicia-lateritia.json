    "intro": "Justicia lateritia, commonly known as the silverleaf justicia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub with silver-gray foliage that reflects sunlight, helping it conserve moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tubular, pink or purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which further reduce water loss. Justicia lateritia is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
