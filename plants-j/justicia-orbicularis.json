    "intro": "Justicia orbicularis, commonly known as the orbicular false heather, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form and produces clusters of showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow. The leaves are typically oval or orbicular in shape, giving the plant its common name, and they are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is well-suited for container gardening or rock gardens. The plant is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
