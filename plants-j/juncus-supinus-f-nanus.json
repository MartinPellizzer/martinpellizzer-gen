    "intro": "Juncus supinus f. nanus, commonly known as the dwarf everlastings, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It features dense clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or coastal cliffs. This variety is a hardy, salt-tolerant species that plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
