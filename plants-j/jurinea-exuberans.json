    "intro": "Jurinea exuberans, commonly known as the hairy sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage covered in dense, fuzzy hairs that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the shoreline. Jurinea exuberans is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient species in harsh coastal habitats."
