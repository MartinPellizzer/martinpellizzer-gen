It belongs to the Juncaceae family and is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, streambanks, and other riparian habitats. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, pale yellow to brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is distinguished by its reddish-brown stems and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
