    "intro": "Juncus subverticillatus var. erectus, commonly known as the upright rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features tall, slender, grass-like stems that grow in dense clumps, often reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences composed of numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a slight sheen, contributing to its ornamental appeal in moist garden settings. This variety is adapted to wet or water-saturated soils and plays a role in stabilizing shoreline ecosystems."
