    "intro": "Juncus acutus var. gallicus, commonly known as the French rush, is a variant of the common rush species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as pond margins and damp soils. The plant features tall, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color and bear small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming dense clumps that help stabilize soil in wetland areas. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
