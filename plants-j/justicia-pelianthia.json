    "intro": "Justicia pelianthia, commonly known as the red hot poker, is a striking perennial plant native to South Africa. It features tall, spiky flower clusters that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow, giving it its common name. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is heightened by its long blooming period, which can last from late spring through early autumn."
