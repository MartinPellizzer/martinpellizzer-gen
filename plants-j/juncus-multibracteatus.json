It belongs to the family Juncaceae and is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are often used in basket weaving. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in suitable habitats."
