    "intro": "Juncus dombeyanus var. typicus, commonly known as the narrowleaf rush, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often in marshes, swamps, or along stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 1 millimeter wide, giving it a delicate appearance. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife."
