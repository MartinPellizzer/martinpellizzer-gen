    "intro": "Juncus nodulosus var. marshallii, commonly known as the Marshall's tufted rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a tufted appearance. The plant typically grows in marshes, pond edges, and other moist habitats, thriving in saturated soils. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, greenish-brown flowers that are clustered in dense, nodular formations. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity."
