    "intro": "Jatropha glauca var. senegalensis, commonly known as the Senegalese jatropha, is a perennial shrub native to tropical Africa. It features erect stems covered in a waxy, bluish-green coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that develop into spiny, three-lobed capsules containing toxic, orange-red seeds. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a rough texture. This species is adapted to poor soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its seeds contain toxic compounds."
