    "intro": "Jurinea grumosa, commonly known as the woolly sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh, dry environments. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations. Its small, white or pale pink flowers bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Jurinea grumosa plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in coastal or desert ecosystems."
