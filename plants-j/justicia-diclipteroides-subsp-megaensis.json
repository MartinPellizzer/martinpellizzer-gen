It is characterized by its large, showy bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in clusters, often in vibrant shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. This subspecies is valued in horticulture for its dramatic appearance and ability to attract pollinators like birds and bees."
