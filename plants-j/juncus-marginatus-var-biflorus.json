    "intro": "Juncus marginatus var. biflorus, commonly known as the coastal rush, is a perennial plant native to coastal regions of the United States. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered flower spikes that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, saline environments and is often found in salt marshes and tidal flats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil in coastal areas. The species is valued for its ecological role in providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
