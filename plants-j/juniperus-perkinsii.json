    "intro": "Juniperus perkinsii, commonly known as the Desert Juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, providing a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, demonstrating remarkable drought tolerance. The bark of Juniperus perkinsii is often fissured and dark brown, adding to its rugged, desert-adapted aesthetic."
