    "intro": "Juniperus sabina f. fastigiata, commonly known as the upright juniper or columnar juniper, is a compact, columnar shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features dense, needle-like foliage that is typically blue-green in color, giving it a distinctive and ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are usually dark blue when mature, providing seasonal interest. It is well-suited for rock gardens, borders, or as a decorative hedge due to its upright growth habit. Juniperus sabina f. fastigiata is relatively low-maintenance, requiring minimal pruning and tolerating a range of soil conditions."
