    "intro": "Jatropha lobata subsp. aceroides, commonly known as the acorn jatropha, is a shrub native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically lobed and have a distinctive, almost acorn-like appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange or red berries containing toxic seeds. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and potential for use in traditional medicine, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
