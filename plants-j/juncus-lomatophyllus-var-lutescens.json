    "intro": "Juncus lomatophyllus var. lutescens, commonly known as the golden rush, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that forms clumps, with slender, cylindrical stems that are typically yellow-green to golden in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist to wet soil conditions, often found in marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its unique coloration and adaptability make it a valuable plant for wetland restoration and ornamental use in water gardens."
