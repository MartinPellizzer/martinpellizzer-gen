    "intro": "Jacobaea paludosa, commonly known as the marsh ragwort, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas in Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes and along water edges. It has a taproot system and produces a milky sap that can be toxic to livestock. Jacobaea paludosa is also known for its ability to thrive in poorly drained soils, making it a common sight in wetland habitats."
