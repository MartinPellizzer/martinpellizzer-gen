    "intro": "Jurinea amplifolia var. pannosa, commonly known as the woolly leaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that provides insulation against extreme temperatures. The plant typically forms compact rosettes with narrow, linear leaves covered in a thick layer of fine hairs. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring or early summer. This species is well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats."
