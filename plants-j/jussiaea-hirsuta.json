    "intro": "Jussiaea hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy willow, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its small, inconspicuous flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and stream banks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its aquatic or semi-aquatic environment. Jussiaea hirsuta plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
