    "intro": "Junellia pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf junellia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of pink and purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Junellia pygmaea has small, narrow leaves and produces seeds enclosed in a capsule, which is dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
