    "intro": "Jussiaea elegans f. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf water willow, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 15 cm in length. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. It produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in aquatic habitats."
