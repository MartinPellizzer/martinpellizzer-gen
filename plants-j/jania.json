    "intro": "Jania, commonly known as the red alga, is a genus of marine red algae belonging to the family Rhodophyceae. It is characterized by its bright red coloration, which comes from pigments such as phycoerythrin. Jania species typically grow in shallow coastal waters, often attached to rocks or other substrates. The thallus is usually branched and filamentous, with a gelatinous texture. These algae play an important role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms."
