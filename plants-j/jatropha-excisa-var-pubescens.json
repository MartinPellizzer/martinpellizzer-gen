    "intro": "Jatropha excisa var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy jatropha, is a species of flowering plant in the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its hairy foliage and striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. It produces toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation, and its seeds are encased in a three-lobed, spiny capsule. This species is also noted for its potential use in biofuel production due to its high oil content in the seeds."
