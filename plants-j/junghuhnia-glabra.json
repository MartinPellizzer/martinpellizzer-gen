    "intro": "Junghuhnia glabra, commonly known as the smooth junghuhnia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are simple, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine, silky texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Junghuhnia glabra is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
