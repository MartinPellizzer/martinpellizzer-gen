    "intro": "Juniperus virginiana var. vulgaris, commonly known as the common juniper, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its scale-like leaves and produces blue-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and small mammals. The plant is adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both dry and moist environments. It is often found in woodland edges, open plains, and rocky areas. The aromatic foliage and persistent berries make it a notable component of its native ecosystems."
