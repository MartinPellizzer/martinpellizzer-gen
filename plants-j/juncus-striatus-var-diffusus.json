    "intro": "Juncus striatus var. diffusus, commonly known as the broadleaf rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It features tall, cylindrical stems that are typically green to reddish in color, often with a slight sheen. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters near the base of the stems, typically in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often growing in dense tufts at the base. This variety is characterized by its diffuse growth habit, where stems spread outward from a central point."
