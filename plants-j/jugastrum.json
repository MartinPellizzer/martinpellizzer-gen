    "intro": "Jugastrum, commonly known as the \"Juglandaceae\" or walnut family, is a genus of flowering plants. These plants are typically deciduous trees or shrubs, characterized by their alternate, simple, and often serrated leaves. Jugastrum species produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually clustered in catkins. The fruits are drupes, containing a single hard-shelled nut enclosed in a fleshy outer layer. These plants are native to temperate regions and are known for their ecological importance in supporting wildlife."
