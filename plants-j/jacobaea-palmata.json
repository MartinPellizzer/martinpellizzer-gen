    "intro": "Jacobaea palmata, commonly known as the palmate ragwort, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of deeply lobed, palmately divided leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clustered heads, which are typically visited by insects such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in dry, open habitats like meadows and rocky slopes. However, it is considered toxic to livestock due to the presence of pyrrolizidine alkaloids."
