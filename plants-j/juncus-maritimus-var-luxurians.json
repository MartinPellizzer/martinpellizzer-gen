    "intro": "Juncus maritimus var. luxurians, commonly known as the coastal rush, is a variant of the common rush that thrives in saline and brackish environments. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and ability to tolerate high salt concentrations. This plant typically grows in coastal areas, marshes, and estuaries, where it plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are adapted for wind pollination. The plant's fibrous roots and rhizomes contribute to its resilience in harsh, wetland conditions."
