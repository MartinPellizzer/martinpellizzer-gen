    "intro": "Jacobinia longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered Jacobinia, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the branches. These flowers bloom during the warmer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Jacobinia longiflora is well adapted to dry, rocky environments and is often found in coastal fynbos vegetation."
