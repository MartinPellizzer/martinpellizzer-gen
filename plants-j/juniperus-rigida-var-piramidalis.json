    "intro": "Juniperus rigida var. piramidalis, commonly known as the pyramidal juniper, is a cold-hardy evergreen shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It features a narrow, conical shape with dense, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are clustered in cones, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a landscape accent plant. Its compact form and winter hardiness make it suitable for cultivation in colder climates."
