    "intro": "Juglans illinoinensis, commonly known as the black walnut, is a deciduous tree native to the central United States. It is characterized by its large, doubly serrated leaves and distinctive, ridged bark. The tree produces clusters of green, pea-like flowers followed by spherical, green fruits that mature to a dark brown color. Its seeds, enclosed in a hard, toxic husk, are widely used in woodworking and as a source of edible nuts after proper processing. The black walnut is also valued for its aromatic wood and its role in supporting local wildlife."
