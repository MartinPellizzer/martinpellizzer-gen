    "intro": "Jussiaea suffruticosa var. sessiliflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved jussiaea, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a shrub that typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, often found in regions with high humidity and poor drainage. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
