    "intro": "Juncus balticus subsp. andicola, commonly known as the Andean rush, is a perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in a fine, hairy texture. This subspecies thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas with cool, temperate climates. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a distinctive, spike-like inflorescence. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
