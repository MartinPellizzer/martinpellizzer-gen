    "intro": "Jacea gheorghieffii, commonly known as the Moldovan bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Romania and Moldova. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves and a fibrous root system. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or wildflower meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
