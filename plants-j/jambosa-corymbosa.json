    "intro": "Jambosa corymbosa, commonly known as the Natal plum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in corymbs, followed by edible, yellow-orange fruits. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained, sandy or loamy soil. It is drought-tolerant and often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive foliage and fruit. The leaves are alternate, simple, and have a rough texture, contributing to its distinctive botanical appearance."
