    "intro": "Juncus orthophyllus, commonly known as the stiff rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems that are often covered in a layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that appear in dense clusters at the top of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically growing in dense tufts at the base. Juncus orthophyllus plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
