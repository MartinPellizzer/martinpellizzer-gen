    "intro": "Juncoides nivalis, commonly known as the snow rush, is a perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that form dense, low-growing clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing greenish-white flowers, which are typically pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Due to its cold tolerance, Juncoides nivalis is an indicator species of high-altitude ecosystems."
