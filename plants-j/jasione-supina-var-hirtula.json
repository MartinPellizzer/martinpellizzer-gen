It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny grasslands and rocky soils, often forming low, spreading mats. Its leaves are linear to lanceolate, with a hairy texture that gives it its common name. The flowers, which are usually pink or purple, bloom in early summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
