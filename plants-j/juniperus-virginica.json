    "intro": "Juniperus virginica, commonly known as the eastern red cedar, is a dioecious evergreen shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and small mammals. The plant is highly adaptable, thriving in a variety of soil types and climates, and is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance. Its aromatic wood has historically been used for fence posts and as a source of aromatic oils."
