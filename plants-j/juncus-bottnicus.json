It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as bogs and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant features tall, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine, grass-like leaves. Its small, clustered flowers are usually green or reddish and appear in late summer. Juncus bottnicus plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various small organisms."
