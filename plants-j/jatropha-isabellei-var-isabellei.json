    "intro": "Jatropha isabellei var. isabellei, commonly known as the Isabelle's physic nut, is a species of flowering plant in the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to parts of Central America and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers and hairy, glandular leaves. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain toxic seeds, which are not suitable for human consumption. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, tropical environments. Due to its ornamental value and potential for biofuel production, it is cultivated in some regions despite its toxic properties."
