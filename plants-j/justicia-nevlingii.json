    "intro": "Justicia nevlingii, commonly known as the Nevling's flamebeard, is a flowering plant native to the United States, specifically found in Texas and New Mexico. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as limestone bluffs and grasslands. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in terminal spikes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
