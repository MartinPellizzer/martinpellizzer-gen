    "intro": "Jatropha breviloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved physic nut, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into capsule fruits containing toxic, orange seeds. Jatropha breviloba is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in semi-arid environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
