It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring opposite, lanceolate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in paniculate inflorescences, which bloom during the rainy season. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along riverbanks."
