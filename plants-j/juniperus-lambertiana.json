    "intro": "Juniperus lambertiana, commonly known as the Rocky Mountain juniper, is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in mountainous regions. Juniperus lambertiana is well adapted to harsh environments and can tolerate drought and poor soil conditions."
