    "intro": "Jacksonia viminalis, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a shrub native to South Australia and Tasmania. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has feathery, bipinnate leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy habitats. Jacksonia viminalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract native pollinators."
