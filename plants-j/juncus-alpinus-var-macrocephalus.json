    "intro": "Juncus alpinus var. macrocephalus, commonly known as the Alpine Rush, is a perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features tall, cylindrical spikes of small, grass-like leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale green flowers at the tip of its stems, which are adapted to pollination by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
