    "intro": "Juncus balticus var. tenuis, commonly known as the slender rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, ditches, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-brown spikelets that are clustered at the tips of its stems. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil in wetland habitats. This variant is distinguished by its slender, more delicate foliage compared to other varieties of Juncus balticus."
