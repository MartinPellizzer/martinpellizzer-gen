    "intro": "Jurinea rhizantha, commonly known as the desert sandflower, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by capsules containing numerous seeds. Its root system is extensive and helps it survive in nutrient-poor, sandy soils. Jurinea rhizantha plays a role in stabilizing dunes and is often found in coastal and inland desert ecosystems."
