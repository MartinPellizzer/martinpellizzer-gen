    "intro": "Juncus supinus var. cylindricus, commonly known as the narrowleaf rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features tall, cylindrical stems that are typically unbranched and covered in narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually green or brown, arranged in spikelets along the stem. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. This variety is distinguished by its narrow, cylindrical stems and is often confused with other rush species due to its similar appearance."
