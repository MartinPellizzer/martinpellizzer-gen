    "intro": "Juncus gerardi persicus, commonly known as the Persian rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and Europe. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and damp woodlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy. Its flowering spikes consist of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
