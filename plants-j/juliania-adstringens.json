    "intro": "Juliania adstringens, commonly known as the swamp lily, is a herbaceous perennial native to the wetlands of South America. It features striking, showy white to pale pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has strap-like leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water, adapting to its aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in wetland environments. Juliania adstringens is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in moist conditions."
