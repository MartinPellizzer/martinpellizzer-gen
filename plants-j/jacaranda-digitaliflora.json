    "intro": "Jacaranda digitaliflora, commonly known as the silky jacaranda, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its foliage. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and urban landscapes. The species is also valued for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
