    "intro": "Jussiaea peruviana var. typica, commonly known as the Peruvian water plant, is a floating aquatic plant native to South America. It features oval, waxy leaves that are typically green to reddish in color, depending on light exposure. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often near the water's surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds and lakes. Its rapid growth makes it both a useful water purifier and a potential invasive species in non-native habitats."
