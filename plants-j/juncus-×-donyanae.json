    "intro": "Juncus \u00d7 donyanae, commonly known as the hybrid rush, is a perennial plant that belongs to the Juncaceae family. It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Juncus bufonius and Juncus subulatus. This plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as along stream banks and in shallow water. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. The plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
