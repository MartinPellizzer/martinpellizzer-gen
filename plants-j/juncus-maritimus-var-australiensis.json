    "intro": "Juncus maritimus var. australiensis, commonly known as the Australian salt marsh rush, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in saline or brackish wetlands, often found in estuaries and tidal flats. The plant has cylindrical, grass-like leaves that are usually green to bluish-green in color. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, which are often submerged or partially submerged in water. This variety is adapted to withstand high salinity and periodic flooding, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
