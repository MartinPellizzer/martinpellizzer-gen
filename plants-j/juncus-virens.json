    "intro": "Juncus virens, commonly known as green rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features tall, cylindrical stems that are typically green to yellow-green in color, often growing up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like with a fibrous texture. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Juncus virens plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
