    "intro": "Juncus stolonifer, commonly known as the creeping rush, is a perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It forms dense clumps through stolons, which are horizontal stems that root at the nodes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikes of small, greenish flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in riparian zones. Its dense growth helps stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
