    "intro": "Juncus mogadorensis, commonly known as the Mogador rush, is a perennial plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that grow in dense clusters, often reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of greenish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and stream banks, and is adapted to coastal conditions. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it ecologically significant in its native habitat."
