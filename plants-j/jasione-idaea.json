    "intro": "Jasione idaea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a silvery underside, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Jasione idaea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in wildflower gardens."
