    "intro": "Joosia ulei, commonly known as the marsh hawksbeard, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its yellow flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Joosia ulei is often found in regions with high water tables and is an important component of wetland ecosystems."
