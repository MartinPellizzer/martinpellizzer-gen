    "intro": "Justicia brevispica var. ampla, commonly known as the broad-bracted flame flower, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range from red to orange, often with a contrasting blue or purple throat. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
