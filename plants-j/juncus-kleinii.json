    "intro": "Juncus kleinii, commonly known as the Klein's rush, is a perennial flowering plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the Juncaceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of grass-like leaves and tall spikes of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water. Juncus kleinii is also valued for its ornamental appeal in garden settings."
