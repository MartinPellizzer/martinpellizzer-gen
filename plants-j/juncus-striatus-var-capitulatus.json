    "intro": "Juncus striatus var. capitulatus, commonly known as the clustered rush, is a perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like foliage that grow close to the ground. The plant typically reaches a height of 12 to 24 inches and has narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, which are arranged in a spike-like cluster at the top of the plant. This variety is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions."
