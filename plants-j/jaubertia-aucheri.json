    "intro": "Jaubertia aucheri, commonly known as the Woolly Thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, oval leaves covered in fine, white hairs that give it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its aromatic leaves and ornamental value make it a popular choice for both ornamental and medicinal purposes."
