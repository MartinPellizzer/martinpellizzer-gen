    "intro": "Juniperus fargesii, commonly known as the Yunnan juniper, is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, providing a striking visual contrast in its natural habitat. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife species. Juniperus fargesii is often found in high-altitude environments, where it adapts to cold and arid conditions. Its slow growth rate and longevity make it a valuable component of its ecosystem, contributing to soil stabilization and habitat diversity."
