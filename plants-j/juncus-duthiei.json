    "intro": "Juncus duthiei, commonly known as the Duthie's rush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Juncaceae family and typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of greenish-white flowers. It is often found in high-elevation areas and is adapted to cold, temperate climates. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
