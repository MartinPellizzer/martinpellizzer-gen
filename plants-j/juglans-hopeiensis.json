It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, pinnately compound leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by edible, woody nuts enclosed in a thick, spiny husk. Its seeds are valued for their nutritional content and are used in traditional Chinese cuisine and medicine."
