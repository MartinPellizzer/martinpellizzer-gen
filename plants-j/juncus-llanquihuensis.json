It belongs to the Juncaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, cylindrical stems and grass-like leaves. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks, wetlands, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are often wind-pollinated. Juncus llanquihuensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
