    "intro": "Jasione humilis subsp. mariana, commonly known as the Maritime Jasione, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It typically features slender, branching stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, which help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces small, pinkish to purple flowers arranged in clusters, blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a waxy layer, providing additional protection against salt spray and wind. Jasione humilis subsp. mariana is well adapted to rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun."
