    "intro": "Jatropha heynei, commonly known as the yellow jatropha, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers, which are followed by spiny, three-lobed capsules containing toxic seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and potential for use in phytoremediation, it has been studied for ecological and agricultural applications."
