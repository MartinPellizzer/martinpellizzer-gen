    "intro": "Jatropha orbicularis, commonly known as the globe jatropha, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and orbicular-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing toxic seeds. It is adapted to arid environments and has a succulent structure to store water. The species is also noted for its potential in biofuel production due to its ability to grow in marginal soils."
