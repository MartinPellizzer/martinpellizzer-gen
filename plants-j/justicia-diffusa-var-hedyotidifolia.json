    "intro": "Justicia diffusa var. hedyotidifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf justicia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a distinctive red or purple calyx. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
