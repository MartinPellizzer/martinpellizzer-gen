    "intro": "Jussiaea terminalis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved waterleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense colonies. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged alternately along the stem. Its small, white flowers are clustered in umbels and bloom in late spring to early summer. Jussiaea terminalis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
