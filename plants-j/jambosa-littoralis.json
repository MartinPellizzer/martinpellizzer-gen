    "intro": "Jambosa littoralis, commonly known as the coastal jambosa, is a tropical shrub native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, fleshy berries. It thrives in saline and humid environments, making it well adapted to coastal ecosystems. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and potential use in coastal restoration projects."
