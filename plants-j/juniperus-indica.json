    "intro": "Juniperus indica, commonly known as Indian juniper, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Himalayas and parts of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 5 meters, featuring a dense, rounded crown and dark green, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like fruits that are aromatic and contain toxic compounds, making them unsuitable for human consumption. Its bark is thin and reddish-brown, often peeling in strips, and it prefers well-drained soils in temperate climates. Juniperus indica is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes."
