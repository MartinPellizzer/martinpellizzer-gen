    "intro": "Juncus balticus var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of the Baltic Sea. It thrives in moist to wet environments, often found in salt marshes and along the edges of freshwater lakes. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are typically green or reddish in color, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in tidal zones. This species is well adapted to brackish water conditions and plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems."
