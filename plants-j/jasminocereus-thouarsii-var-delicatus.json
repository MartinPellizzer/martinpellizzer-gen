    "intro": "Jasminocereus thouarsii var. delicatus, commonly known as the fragrant night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of small, white flowers that open at night. The plant produces a mild, sweet fragrance, which attracts nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
