    "intro": "Juncus cymosus, commonly known as the tufted rush, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that are often hairy and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters at the top of the stems. Juncus cymosus plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
