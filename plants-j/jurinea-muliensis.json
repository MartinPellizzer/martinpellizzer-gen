    "intro": "Jurinea muliensis, commonly known as the Tibetan sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet. It is a member of the Montiaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Jurinea muliensis is adapted to survive in harsh, cold, and windy conditions typical of its alpine habitat."
