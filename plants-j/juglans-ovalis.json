    "intro": "Juglans ovalis, commonly known as the oval walnut, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It belongs to the walnut family, Juglandaceae, and is characterized by its large, oval-shaped nuts enclosed in a thick, green husk. The tree produces compound leaves with long, slender leaflets and has a distinctive, rugged bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are dioecious, with separate male and female trees, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. The fruit is an important food source for various wildlife species and has been used by indigenous peoples for both culinary and medicinal purposes."
