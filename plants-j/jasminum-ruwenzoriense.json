    "intro": "Jasminum ruwenzoriense, commonly known as the Ruwenzori jasmine, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Ruwenzori Mountains in Uganda and Tanzania. It is characterized by its fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the cooler months. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and is typically shrub-like in growth habit. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a cool climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
