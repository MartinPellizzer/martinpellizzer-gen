It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces clusters of showy, tubular flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom from late spring to early fall. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks."
