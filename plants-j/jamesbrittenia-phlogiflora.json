    "intro": "Jamesbrittenia phlogiflora, commonly known as the flame-flowered brittenia, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, flame-like orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters during the warm season. The plant has glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a waxy texture. Its unique floral structure attracts a variety of pollinators, including bees and butterflies. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth rate, it is considered a conservation concern."
