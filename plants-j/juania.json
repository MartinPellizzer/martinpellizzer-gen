    "intro": "Juania, commonly known as the common larkspur, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are herbaceous perennials native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have palmately divided leaves and produce showy, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Juania species are often found in meadows, woodlands, and rocky soils, thriving in well-drained environments. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and have been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
