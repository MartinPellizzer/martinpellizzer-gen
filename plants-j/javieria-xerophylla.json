    "intro": "Javieria xerophylla, commonly known as the desert feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid regions of North America. It features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with a dense, mat-forming growth habit that helps it thrive in harsh, dry environments. Javieria xerophylla is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in sandy or rocky soils."
