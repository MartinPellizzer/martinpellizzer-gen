    "intro": "Jupunba jupunba, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae and is characterized by its striking, translucent leaves that resemble ghostly veils. The plant produces small, pale flowers that bloom at night, adding to its ethereal appearance. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of scientific study."
