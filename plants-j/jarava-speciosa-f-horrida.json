    "intro": "Jarava speciosa f. horrida, commonly known as the rough jarava, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in arid and semi-arid regions, contributing to the ecological stability of these environments."
