    "intro": "Jaborosa integrifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf jaborosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grasslands and open woodlands, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are entire, meaning they have no teeth or lobes, and are arranged alternately along the stem. Jaborosa integrifolia produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
