    "intro": "Juncus fraternus, commonly known as the common rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments across North America. It typically grows in dense clusters, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with cylindrical, hollow stems that are often green or reddish in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes at the top of the stems, which are usually greenish or brownish in hue. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil in marshy areas, making it an important species for wetland ecosystems. Juncus fraternus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate and thrive in saturated soils."
