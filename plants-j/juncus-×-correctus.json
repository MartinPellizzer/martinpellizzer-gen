    "intro": "Juncus \u00d7 correctus, commonly known as the hybrid rush, is a perennial plant belonging to the Juncaceae family. It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Juncus effusus and Juncus roemerianus. This plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and coastal areas. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spike-like inflorescences with small, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its adaptability, it is often found in brackish or saline environments along shorelines."
