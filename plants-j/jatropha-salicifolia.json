It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its lanceolate, willow-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are followed by bright orange or red berries. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in semi-arid conditions. Jatropha salicifolia is also noted for its potential in biofuel production due to its high oil content in its seeds."
