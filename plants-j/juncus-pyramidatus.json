    "intro": "Juncus pyramidatus, commonly known as the pyramid sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and arranged in dense clusters. The plant produces tall, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, clustered flowers, which are often wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to waterlogged soils and is often found in pond margins, ditches, and other wet habitats. Juncus pyramidatus plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
