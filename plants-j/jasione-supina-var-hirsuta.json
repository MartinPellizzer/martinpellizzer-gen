    "intro": "Jasione supina var. hirsuta, commonly known as hairy bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered with fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Small white or pale blue flowers appear in summer, contributing to its ecological value as a nectar source for pollinators."
