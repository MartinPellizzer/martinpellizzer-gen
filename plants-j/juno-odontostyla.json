    "intro": "Juno odontostyla, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and large, pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in swampy areas. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and surrounding substrates. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Juno odontostyla is considered a conservation concern."
