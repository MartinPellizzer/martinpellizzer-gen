It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and tidal wetland habitats. Jagera latifolia is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
