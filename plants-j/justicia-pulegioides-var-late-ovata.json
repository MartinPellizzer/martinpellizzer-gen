    "intro": "Justicia pulegioides var. late-ovata, commonly known as the late-ovate jewelweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features erect, branched stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are ovate to elliptical in shape, often with a slightly wavy margin. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found near streams or in woodland areas. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal."
