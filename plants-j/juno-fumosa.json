    "intro": "Juno fumosa, commonly known as the smoky juniper, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, blue-gray berries that are often used in traditional medicine by Indigenous peoples. Its leaves are scale-like and tightly packed, reducing water loss in arid conditions. Juno fumosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
