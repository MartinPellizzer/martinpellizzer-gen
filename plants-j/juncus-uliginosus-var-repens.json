    "intro": "Juncus uliginosus var. repens, commonly known as the creeping marsh rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It features grass-like leaves that are narrow and cylindrical, typically growing in dense clumps. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish or brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to saturated soils, often found in bogs, fens, and marshes. This variant is distinguished by its spreading growth habit, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil in wetland ecosystems."
