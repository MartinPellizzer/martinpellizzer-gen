    "intro": "Juniperus australis, commonly known as the Australian juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and semi-arid regions. Juniperus australis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native fauna."
