It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its scientific name reflects its traditional use in treating dysentery, though its medicinal properties require further botanical study."
