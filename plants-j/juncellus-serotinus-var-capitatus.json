    "intro": "Juncellus serotinus var. capitatus, commonly known as the late-flowering rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, ditches, and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers in late summer. Its inflorescence is usually terminal, forming a compact head that distinguishes it from other rush species. The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
