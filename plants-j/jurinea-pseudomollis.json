    "intro": "Jurinea pseudomollis, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the western Pacific. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to salt spray and coastal conditions. It has a low-growing, mat-forming habit, which helps it withstand strong winds and tidal action. Jurinea pseudomollis is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
