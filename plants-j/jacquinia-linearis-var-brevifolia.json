    "intro": "Jacquinia linearis var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved linear jacquinia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its slender, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its small, bell-shaped flowers are usually pink or white, and it produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. This variety is distinguished by its shorter leaves compared to the typical form of Jacquinia linearis."
