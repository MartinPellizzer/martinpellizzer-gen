    "intro": "Juncus duvalii, commonly known as Duval's rush, is a perennial plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense stands in moist or saturated soils. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-yellow flowers in late summer, which are followed by dark, spherical berries. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland environments. Juncus duvalii plays an important role in providing habitat and food for various wetland wildlife species."
