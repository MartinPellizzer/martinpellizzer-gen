    "intro": "Jatropha vitifolia var. repanda, commonly known as the broad-leafed physic nut, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often broad and ovate with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into spiny, capsule-like fruits containing toxic seeds. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both ecological studies and horticultural research. The plant is also noted for its potential in biofuel production due to its oil-rich seeds."
