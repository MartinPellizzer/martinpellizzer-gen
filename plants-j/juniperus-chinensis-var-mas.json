    "intro": "Juniperus chinensis var. mas, commonly known as Chinese juniper or red juniper, is a variant of the Chinese juniper species native to East Asia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree that typically grows in rocky or mountainous regions. The plant is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage and small, blue-gray or dark blue berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. It has a slow growth rate and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal. The leaves are aromatic and contain compounds that have been used in traditional medicine."
