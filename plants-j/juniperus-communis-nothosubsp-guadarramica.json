It is a small, evergreen shrub or tree with needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. This subspecies is notable for its ecological importance and resilience in harsh environments."
