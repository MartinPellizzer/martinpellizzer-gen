    "intro": "Juncus saximontanus var. robustior, commonly known as the robust junegrass, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in riparian zones, wet meadows, and along streambanks. This variant is distinguished by its more robust growth compared to other varieties of Juncus saximontanus."
