    "intro": "Jurinea wardii, commonly known as the Ward's sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, adapting to salty and windy conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of salt, which helps in reducing water loss. Jurinea wardii is known for its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators."
