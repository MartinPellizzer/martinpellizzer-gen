    "intro": "Jatropha carpinifolia, commonly known as the spiny euphorbia, is a shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features woody stems covered in sharp, spiny projections, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange-red berries containing toxic seeds. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, with a rough texture and a distinct, aromatic scent. Jatropha carpinifolia is adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it a resilient species in coastal and mountainous regions."
