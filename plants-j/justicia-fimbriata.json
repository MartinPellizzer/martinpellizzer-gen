    "intro": "Justicia fimbriata, commonly known as the flame flower or red flame plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 feet, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. The flowers attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees, making it a valuable addition to gardens."
