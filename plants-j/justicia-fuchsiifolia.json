    "intro": "Justicia fuchsiifolia, commonly known as the flame-of-the-forest, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, vibrant red bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically green or yellow in color, contrasting with the showy bracts. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The plant is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
