    "intro": "Justicia sessilifolia, commonly known as the purple false heather, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces clusters of tubular, purple to pink flowers. The leaves are sessile, meaning they lack stalks, and are typically opposite or whorled in arrangement. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. The plant is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
