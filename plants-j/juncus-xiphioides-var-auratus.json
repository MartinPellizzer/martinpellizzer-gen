    "intro": "Juncus xiphioides var. auratus, commonly known as the golden rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the eastern United States. It features tall, slender stems that are typically bright yellow to golden in color, especially during the flowering season. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are borne on slender panicles. It thrives in wet to moist soils, often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its ornamental value comes from its striking color and ability to form dense colonies in wetland environments."
