    "intro": "Jurinea gedrosiaca, commonly known as the Gedrosian sandflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Pakistan and Afghanistan. It is a low-growing annual herb that thrives in sandy and rocky soils, often found in desert and semi-desert environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months, adapting to the harsh conditions of its habitat. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Jurinea gedrosiaca plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and supporting local biodiversity in its native range."
