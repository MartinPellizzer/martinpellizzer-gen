    "intro": "Juniperus communis var. arborea, commonly known as the creeping juniper, is a low-growing shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features dense, scale-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, forming compact, mat-like growth patterns. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for various birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value. This variety is particularly adapted to rocky or arid environments, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping."
