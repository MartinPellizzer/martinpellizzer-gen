    "intro": "Johnstonella punensis, commonly known as the Punta Arenas plant, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Chile. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Johnstonella punensis is adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. It plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and habitat."
