    "intro": "Jonesiopsis roei, commonly known as the slender staghorn fern, is a rare epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like structure with closely packed fronds. The plant's leaves are typically leathery and dark green, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. Jonesiopsis roei thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of air humidity and indirect light. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and often overlooked species in botanical studies."
