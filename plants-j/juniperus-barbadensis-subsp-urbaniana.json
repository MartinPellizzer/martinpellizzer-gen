    "intro": "Juniperus barbadensis subsp. urbaniana, commonly known as the Barbados juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean islands. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or inland areas with a warm, humid climate. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
