    "intro": "Jatropha lobata var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy jatropha, is a perennial shrub native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into capsule fruits containing toxic, orange-red seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
