    "intro": "Jungia affinis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed jungle grass, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish or yellowish in color, followed by small, three-lobed fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Jungia affinis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
