    "intro": "Juno leptoneura, commonly known as the slender-veined juniper, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces blue-black berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Juno leptoneura is often found in rocky soils and mountainous regions. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
