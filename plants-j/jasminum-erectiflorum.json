    "intro": "Jasminum erectiflorum, commonly known as the upright-flowered jasmine, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. The plant has slender, woody stems and lance-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in forest understories or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not as widely known as other jasmine species."
