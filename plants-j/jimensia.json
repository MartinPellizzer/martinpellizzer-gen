    "intro": "Jimensia, commonly known as the \"jimsonweed,\" is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its spiny stems and lobed leaves. Jimensia produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, round berries that contain toxic seeds. The plant is known for its hallucinogenic properties due to the presence of alkaloids like scopolamine and hyoscyamine. It has been used historically by indigenous peoples for both medicinal and ritual purposes."
