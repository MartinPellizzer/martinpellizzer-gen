    "intro": "Justicia pectinella, commonly known as the featherwing plant, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, feather-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or near water sources. Justicia pectinella is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
