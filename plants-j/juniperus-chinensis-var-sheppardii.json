    "intro": "Juniperus chinensis var. sheppardii, commonly known as the Chinese juniper or Sheppard's juniper, is a variety of the Chinese juniper native to eastern Asia. It is a slow-growing evergreen shrub or small tree with dense, scale-like foliage that is typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and as a landscape ornamental. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
