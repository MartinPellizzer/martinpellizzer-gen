It is characterized by its striking blue or violet bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and has narrow, grass-like leaves. Juelia thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is further enhanced by its fragrant blooms and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
