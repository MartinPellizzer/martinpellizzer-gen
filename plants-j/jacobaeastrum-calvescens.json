    "intro": "Jacobaeastrum calvescens, commonly known as the yellow ragwort, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that are typically arranged in dense clusters, and it has rough, hairy leaves that are often bluish-green in color. Jacobaeastrum calvescens is a biennial or short-lived perennial, and it thrives in dry, disturbed soils such as roadsides and wastelands. It is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
