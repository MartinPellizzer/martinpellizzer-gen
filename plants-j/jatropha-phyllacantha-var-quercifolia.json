    "intro": "Jatropha phyllacantha var. quercifolia, commonly known as the oak-leaf jatropha, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, lobed leaves that resemble the shape of an oak leaf, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by bright orange or red berries that contain toxic seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in disturbed or semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and potential for medicinal use, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
