    "intro": "Jurinea apoda, commonly known as the naked leaf jurinea, is a flowering plant native to the cold regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its simple, often hairy leaves and small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine or arctic environments, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its low-growing habit and ability to survive in harsh climates make it an important component of tundra ecosystems. Jurinea apoda plays a role in supporting local pollinators and contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat."
