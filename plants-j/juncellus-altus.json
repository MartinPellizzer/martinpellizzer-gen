    "intro": "Juncellus altus, commonly known as the tall rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist to wet environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant features tall, cylindrical stems that are usually green or reddish in color, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters near the base of the stem. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming dense clumps that help stabilize soil in wetland habitats. Juncellus altus plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
