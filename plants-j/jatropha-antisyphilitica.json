    "intro": "Jatropha antisyphilitica, commonly known as the syphilis plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and the Caribbean. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and distinctive yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain toxic seeds, which are not suitable for consumption. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided by livestock and humans."
