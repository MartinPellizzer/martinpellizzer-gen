    "intro": "Jatropha adenophila, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive leaves with glandular hairs and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces toxic sap that can cause irritation upon contact with the skin. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds covered in a sticky substance. Jatropha adenophila is often found in disturbed habitats and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
