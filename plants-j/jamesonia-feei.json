    "intro": "Jamesonia feei, commonly known as the Western sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the western United States. It is characterized by its sword-shaped, arching fronds that can grow up to 3 feet in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. Jamesonia feei is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in humid, cool climates."
