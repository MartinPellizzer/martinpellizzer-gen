    "intro": "Juncus effusus var. decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive rush, is a perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that often grow in dense clusters, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically dark green in color. This variety is sometimes mistaken for other rush species due to its similar appearance, hence its common name."
