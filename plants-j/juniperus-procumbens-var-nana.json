    "intro": "Juniperus procumbens var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf Japanese juniper, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features dense, compact foliage composed of scale-like leaves that are dark green and often covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are typically blue or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and bonsai cultivation. Due to its slow growth and ornamental appeal, it is often used in landscape design for its hardy and aesthetic qualities."
