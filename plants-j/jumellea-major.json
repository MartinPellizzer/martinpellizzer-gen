    "intro": "Jumellea major, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its thick, milky sap, which is a distinguishing botanical feature. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are simple and opposite, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Jumellea major is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
