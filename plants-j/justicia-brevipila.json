It features slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine silvery down. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of blue or purple, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value contribute to its use in both ornamental and ecological landscapes."
