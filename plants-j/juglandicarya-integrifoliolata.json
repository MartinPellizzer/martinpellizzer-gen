    "intro": "Juglandicarya integrifoliolata, commonly known as the smooth-leafed walnut tree, is a species native to the temperate regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically composed of 5 to 9 pairs of oval, serrated leaflets. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by edible nuts enclosed in a thick, husky shell. Its seeds are a valuable food source for various wildlife and have been used traditionally in some cultures. The plant exhibits a moderate growth rate and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
