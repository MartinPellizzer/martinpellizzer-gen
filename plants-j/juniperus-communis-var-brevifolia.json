    "intro": "Juniperus communis var. brevifolia, commonly known as the dwarf juniper, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to northern regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It features dense, scale-like foliage that is typically blue-gray in color, providing a striking contrast to its dark green stems. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. It is well adapted to harsh climates, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often used in landscaping and as a ground cover in cold climates."
