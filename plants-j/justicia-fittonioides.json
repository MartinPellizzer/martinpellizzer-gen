    "intro": "Justicia fittonioides, commonly known as the flame flower or red mistflower, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that resemble clusters of small, red flowers, which are actually clusters of tiny, tubular blooms. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is often used in ornamental gardening for its vibrant color and ability to attract pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. The plant is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil and is drought-tolerant once established."
