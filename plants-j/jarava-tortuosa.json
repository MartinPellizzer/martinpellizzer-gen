It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its wiry, twisted stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale blue to white flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland dune environments. Jarava tortuosa is adapted to arid conditions and is relatively drought-tolerant."
