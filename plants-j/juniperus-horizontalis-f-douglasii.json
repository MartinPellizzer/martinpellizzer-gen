    "intro": "Juniperus horizontalis f. douglasii, commonly known as creeping juniper, is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. It features scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, providing a striking visual contrast in garden settings. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are often used in ornamental horticulture. It is native to the western United States and thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Its compact form and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and ground cover."
