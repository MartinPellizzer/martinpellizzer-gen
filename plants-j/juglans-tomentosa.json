    "intro": "Juglans tomentosa, commonly known as the American hazelnut or the beaked hazelnut, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, pinnately compound leaves with a fuzzy underside. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by oval, greenish-brown nuts enclosed in a spiny husk. Its seeds are edible and are often used in cooking, while the tree also provides habitat and food for various wildlife species. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas."
