    "intro": "Jamesonia congesta, commonly known as the clustered jamesonia, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in conservation efforts."
