    "intro": "Juncus castelli, commonly known as Castell's rush, is a perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and damp woodlands. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that are often green or reddish in color, and it produces small, clustered flowers in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming dense clumps that help stabilize soil in wetland habitats. Juncus castelli is valued for its ecological role in providing habitat for various insects and birds."
