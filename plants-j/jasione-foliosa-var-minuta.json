    "intro": "Jasione foliosa var. minuta, commonly known as the small-leafed jasione, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features delicate, narrow leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length, giving it a finely textured appearance. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its subtle beauty."
