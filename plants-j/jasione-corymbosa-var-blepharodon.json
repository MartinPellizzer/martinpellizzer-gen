It features upright stems covered in dense, blue-violet flowers that bloom in summer. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long-lasting blooms."
