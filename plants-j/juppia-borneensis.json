It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. It typically grows as an understory plant, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
