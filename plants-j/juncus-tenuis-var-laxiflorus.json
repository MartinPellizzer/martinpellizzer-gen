It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that often grow in dense clusters. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in loose spikes, which distinguish it from other juncus varieties. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. This plant plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
