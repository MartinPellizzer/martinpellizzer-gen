    "intro": "Justicia calcarata, commonly known as the rock fig or mountain fig, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale pink flowers, which are typically followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rocky or arid environments. The botanical features of Justicia calcarata make it a valuable plant for both ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
