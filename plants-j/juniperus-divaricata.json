    "intro": "Juniperus divaricata, commonly known as the creeping juniper, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features dense, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, providing a striking visual contrast against rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, blue-gray berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Juniperus divaricata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
