    "intro": "Jenmania, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its delicate, white, and translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. Jenmania lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, it is highly valued in both botanical research and conservation efforts."
