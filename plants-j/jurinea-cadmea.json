    "intro": "Jurinea cadmea, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its silvery, woolly leaves and blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Its structure is low-growing, with a rosette of leaves forming a dense mat. Jurinea cadmea plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small coastal organisms."
