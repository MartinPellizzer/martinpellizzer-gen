    "intro": "Juniperus communis subsp. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf juniper, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of less than 1 meter, featuring dense, scale-like leaves that are dark green and closely pressed to the stems. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. It is highly cold-tolerant and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. This subspecies is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardiness in harsh climates."
