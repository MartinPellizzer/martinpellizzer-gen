    "intro": "Juno regis-uzziae, commonly known as the sacred fig of ancient Rome, is a species of Ficus native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and a thick, woody trunk that can grow quite tall. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into edible figs, which are rich in nutrients. It thrived in Roman gardens and was often associated with religious and symbolic significance. Its resilience and adaptability made it a valued plant in both horticulture and cultural practices."
