    "intro": "Juncus sylvaticus var. elongatus, commonly known as the tall rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marshy environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, making it one of the taller varieties within the Juncus genus. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, typically in shades of greenish-white or pale yellow. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a slight sheen, contributing to its aesthetic appeal in wetland habitats. This variety is valued for its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils and its role in stabilizing shorelines and supporting biodiversity."
