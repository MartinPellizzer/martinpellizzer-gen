    "intro": "Jatropha elbae, commonly known as the Elba croton, is a shrub native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces capsules that contain toxic seeds, which are a defense mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to the unique climate of its native region. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Jatropha elbae is considered an endangered species."
