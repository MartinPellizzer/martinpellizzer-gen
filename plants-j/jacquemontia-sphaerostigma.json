It features heart-shaped leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. The plant is characterized by its unique spherical seed pods, which give it its scientific name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. The flowers open in the morning and close in the afternoon, hence its common name."
