It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in rocky crevices. Its leaves are finely divided and have a distinctive silvery-green coloration. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health."
