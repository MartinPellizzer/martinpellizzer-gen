    "intro": "Jacquemontia ferruginea var. mucronata, commonly known as the yellow morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trumpet-shaped, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its stems are often sprawling or trailing. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The varietal form, mucronata, is distinguished by its short, sharp leaf tips and slightly different flower structure compared to the typical variety."
