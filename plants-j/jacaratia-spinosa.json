    "intro": "Jacaratia spinosa, commonly known as the spiny jacaranda, is a shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in sharp, spiny projections, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a rough texture. Jacaratia spinosa is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
