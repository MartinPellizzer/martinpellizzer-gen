    "intro": "Juncus microcephalus var. intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clusters with slender, cylindrical stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slightly hairy texture. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
