    "intro": "Juncus densiflorus var. cyperinus, commonly known as the dense-flowered rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features cylindrical, grass-like stems that are often reddish-brown in color and bear clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, arranged in dense, compact tufts at the base. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
