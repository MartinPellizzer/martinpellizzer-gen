    "intro": "Juniperus cerrosianus, commonly known as the mountain juniper, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It typically grows in rocky, arid environments and is well adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions. The plant has scale-like leaves that are tightly packed, reducing water loss in its dry habitat. Its cones, which are small and berry-like, contain the aromatic seeds that are used in various traditional and commercial applications. The plant's resilience and ability to thrive in poor soils make it an important component of its ecosystem."
