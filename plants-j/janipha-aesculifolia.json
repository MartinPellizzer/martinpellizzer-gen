    "intro": "Janipha aesculifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed horse chestnut, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It features compound leaves with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, followed by spiny, spherical fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for gardens and landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its seasonal changes, from vibrant foliage in autumn to the dramatic display of its flowers."
