    "intro": "Justicia hyperdasya, commonly known as the flame flower, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with lance-shaped, opposite leaves. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, especially hummingbirds, due to their bright color and nectar-rich structure. Justicia hyperdasya is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
