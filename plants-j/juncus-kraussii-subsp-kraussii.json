It is characterized by its dense clusters of grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in summer. The plant thrives in wet or marshy environments, often found along riverbanks and in swampy areas. It has fibrous roots that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for wetland gardens and ecological restoration projects."
