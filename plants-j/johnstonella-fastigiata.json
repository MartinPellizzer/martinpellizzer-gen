    "intro": "Johnstonella fastigiata, commonly known as the upright broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants. The plant has a slender, erect stem with small, scale-like leaves that are not visible above ground. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish and are arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. Johnstonella fastigiata is found in various parts of Europe and is often a rare and elusive species in its habitat."
