It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its yellow flowers are arranged in flat-topped clusters, and the leaves are typically gray-green with a distinctive pungent aroma. Jacobaea flexuosa is known for its medicinal properties and has been used historically in herbal remedies."
