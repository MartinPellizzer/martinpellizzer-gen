    "intro": "Juncus arcticus var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal rush, is a hardy plant adapted to harsh environments. It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and rocky shores, where it tolerates high salinity and strong winds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. It plays a vital role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Its ability to grow in poor soils makes it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
