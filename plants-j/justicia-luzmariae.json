    "intro": "Justicia luzmariae, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil. Its ornamental value comes from its striking floral display and its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
