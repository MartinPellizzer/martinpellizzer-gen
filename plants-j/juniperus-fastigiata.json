    "intro": "Juniperus fastigiata, commonly known as the upright juniper or the pyramidal juniper, is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, columnar growth habit, with stiff, scale-like leaves that are blue-gray in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are typically dark blue when mature, containing toxic seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or arid landscapes. Juniperus fastigiata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in landscaping for its hardy nature and drought tolerance."
