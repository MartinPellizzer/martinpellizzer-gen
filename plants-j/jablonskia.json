It belongs to the family Rosaceae, which includes roses and other flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring, typically in shades of pink and white. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a slightly serrated edge. Jablonskia is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been the subject of botanical study due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
