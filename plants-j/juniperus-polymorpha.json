    "intro": "Juniperus polymorpha, commonly known as the creeping juniper, is a species of juniper native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit, with scaly, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Juniperus polymorpha is valued for its hardiness and is commonly used in landscaping and as a ground cover."
