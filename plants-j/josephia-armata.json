    "intro": "Josephia armata, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet. The plant has a short, woody stem and produces small, spiny leaves adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Josephia armata is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
