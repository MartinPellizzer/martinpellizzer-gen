It is characterized by its woody stems and small, elliptical leaves that are sharply pointed at the tips. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
