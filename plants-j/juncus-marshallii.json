It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like stems that are often clustered together, forming dense stands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring. Juncus marshallii plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
