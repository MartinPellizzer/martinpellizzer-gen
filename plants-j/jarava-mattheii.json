    "intro": "Jarava mattheii, commonly known as the Cape York jarava, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of northern Australia. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in coastal dunes and saltmarsh environments. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, typical of the grass family. Jarava mattheii plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for local wildlife."
