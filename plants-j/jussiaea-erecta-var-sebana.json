    "intro": "Jussiaea erecta var. sebana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water primrose, is a perennial aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Its leaves are narrow, elongated, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, often emerging above the water surface."
