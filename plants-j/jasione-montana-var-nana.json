    "intro": "Jasione montana var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf mountain bellflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features compact rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, blue to violet flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to alpine gardens. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it suitable for rock gardens and borders. It is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
