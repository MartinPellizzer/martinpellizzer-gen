    "intro": "Juncus squarrosus var. luxurians, commonly known as the showy rush, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and bright yellow to orange flower spikes that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wet to moist habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and pond edges. Its slender, cylindrical stems are often covered in soft, white to grayish hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The variety 'luxurians' is noted for its more profuse flowering and vigorous growth compared to the typical form of Juncus squarrosus."
