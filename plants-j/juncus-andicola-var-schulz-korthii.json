It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and is typically found in moist, rocky habitats. The plant has narrow, cylindrical leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair, aiding in water retention. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to alpine environments."
