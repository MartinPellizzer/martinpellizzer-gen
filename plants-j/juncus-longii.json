    "intro": "Juncus longii, commonly known as the long spike rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical spikes of small, greenish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that grow in dense clusters, often forming a compact rosette at the base. Juncus longii thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its structure and growth habits make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
