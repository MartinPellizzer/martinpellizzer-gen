    "intro": "Juncoides peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian rush, is a flowering plant belonging to the Juncaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Peru, and thrives in moist, temperate environments. The plant features slender, grass-like stems that grow from a rhizomatous base, often forming dense clumps. Its small, greenish-white flowers are typically arranged in spike-like clusters, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Juncoides peruviana is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
