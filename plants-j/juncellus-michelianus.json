    "intro": "Juncellus michelianus, commonly known as the Micheli's rush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Juncaceae. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, cylindrical leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spike-like clusters. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it often grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and damp woodlands. The plant typically reaches heights of 30 to 60 centimeters and is adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
