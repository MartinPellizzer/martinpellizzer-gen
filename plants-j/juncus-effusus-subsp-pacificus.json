    "intro": "Juncus effusus subsp. pacificus, commonly known as the Pacific rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal areas of the Pacific Northwest. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, tidal flats, and along stream banks. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color and bear small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in its habitat. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its adaptability to brackish water conditions."
