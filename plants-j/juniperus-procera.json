    "intro": "Juniperus procera, commonly known as the African juniper, is a tall evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of eastern and southern Africa. It is characterized by its straight, cylindrical trunk and dense, dark green foliage that forms a conical or pyramidal shape. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife, aiding in seed dispersal. Its wood is hard and durable, making it valuable for construction and furniture-making. Juniperus procera is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
