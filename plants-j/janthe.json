    "intro": "Janthe, commonly known as the \"false orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in shaded, moist environments. Janthe species are characterized by their delicate, often fragrant flowers that resemble those of true orchids. They have rhizomatous growth habits and produce small, clustered inflorescences. The leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, contributing to their ornamental appeal in horticulture."
