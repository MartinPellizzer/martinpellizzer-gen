    "intro": "Juniperus rufescens, commonly known as the red juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its reddish-brown bark and scale-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. Juniperus rufescens is adapted to arid and rocky environments, often growing in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Its aromatic foliage and resilience make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
