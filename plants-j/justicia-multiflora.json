    "intro": "Justicia multiflora, commonly known as the red hot poker, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its tall, spike-like inflorescences that bear bright red bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, surrounded by the showy bracts. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Justicia multiflora is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
