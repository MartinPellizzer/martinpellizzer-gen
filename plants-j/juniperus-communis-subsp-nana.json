    "intro": "Juniperus communis subsp. nana, commonly known as dwarf juniper, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to arctic and alpine regions. It features compact, dense foliage with scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in poor, well-drained soils and is highly frost-resistant. This subspecies is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in rock gardens and as a ground cover."
