    "intro": "Juttadinteria tetrasepala, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with thick, fleshy stems and leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, yellow, dandelion-like flowers that bloom in spring. Its flowers are followed by distinctive, inflated seed pods that burst open to disperse seeds. Juttadinteria tetrasepala is well-suited to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
