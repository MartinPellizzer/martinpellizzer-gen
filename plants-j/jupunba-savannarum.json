    "intro": "Jupunba savannarum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark red wood that is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has a broad, spreading canopy with lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by winged fruits. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
