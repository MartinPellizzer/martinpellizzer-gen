    "intro": "Jurinea levieri, commonly known as the Levieri's sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of salt-tolerant hairs. Jurinea levieri is adapted to harsh maritime conditions and plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
