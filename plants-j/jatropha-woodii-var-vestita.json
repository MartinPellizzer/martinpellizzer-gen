    "intro": "Jatropha woodii var. vestita, commonly known as the naked jatropha, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that contain toxic seeds, a trait common in the Euphorbiaceae family. It is often found in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils."
