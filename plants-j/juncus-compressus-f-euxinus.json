    "intro": "Juncus compressus f. euxinus, commonly known as the Crimean rush, is a compact, herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as riverbanks and coastal areas, where it thrives in moist, saline conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects. This form is distinguished by its compact growth habit and adaptation to saline environments."
