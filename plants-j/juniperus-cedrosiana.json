    "intro": "Juniperus cedrosiana, commonly known as Cedros Island juniper, is a rare and endemic species native to the Channel Islands of California. It is a small evergreen shrub or tree that typically grows in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. The plant has needle-like leaves that are often blue-gray in color, and it produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for wildlife. It is adapted to the arid and coastal conditions of its native range, showing resilience to drought and salt spray. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
