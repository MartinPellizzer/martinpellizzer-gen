    "intro": "Jugastrum poiteaui, commonly known as the Poitevin's jugastrum, is a rare and enigmatic plant species belonging to the family Juglandaceae. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring compound leaves with serrated margins and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces edible nuts encased in a thick, woody husk, which are typically harvested in late autumn. Native to a limited geographic range in southern France, it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. Due to its restricted habitat and low population numbers, Jugastrum poiteaui is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
