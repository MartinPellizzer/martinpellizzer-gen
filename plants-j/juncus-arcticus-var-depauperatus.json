    "intro": "Juncus arcticus var. depauperatus, commonly known as the Arctic rush, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length, adapted to withstand harsh cold and strong winds. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters at the ends of its stems, which are often hidden among the foliage. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
