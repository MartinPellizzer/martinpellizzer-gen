    "intro": "Jacquemontia sandwicensis var. tomentosa, commonly known as the Hawaiian marsh bean, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in wetland and marshy habitats, often found in coastal areas with high moisture levels. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest in botanical studies. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this rare and endemic species from habitat loss and invasive species."
