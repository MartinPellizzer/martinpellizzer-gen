    "intro": "Jurinea, commonly known as sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and are adapted to saline and sandy soils. They have distinctive silver-gray foliage and produce small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer. Jurinea species are often used in coastal landscaping due to their hardiness and aesthetic appeal. Their ability to thrive in harsh environments makes them an important part of maritime ecosystems."
