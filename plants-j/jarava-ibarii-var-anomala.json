It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its ecological role includes providing habitat for small animals and contributing to soil stabilization in its native environment."
