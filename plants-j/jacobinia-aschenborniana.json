    "intro": "Jacobinia aschenborniana, commonly known as the Ashenborn's jacobinia, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, with leaves that are typically narrow and leathery to resist water loss. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
