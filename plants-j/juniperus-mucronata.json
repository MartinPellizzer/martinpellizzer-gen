    "intro": "Juniperus mucronata, commonly known as the African juniper, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, scale-like leaves that are often clustered at the ends of the branches. The plant produces blue or purple berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils. Juniperus mucronata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
