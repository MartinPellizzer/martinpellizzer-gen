    "intro": "Jarava arenicola, commonly known as the sand grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion. Its resilience makes it a valuable component of desert ecosystems."
