It typically grows in wet or seasonally wet habitats such as swamps, stream banks, and damp forest floors. The plant has cylindrical, somewhat fibrous stems that are often reddish or brownish in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. This subspecies is adapted to moist environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
