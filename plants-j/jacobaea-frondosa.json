    "intro": "Jacobaea frondosa, commonly known as the fronded ragwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant features basal rosettes of broadly lanceolate leaves and a flowering stem that bears yellow flowers in a terminal cluster. Its leaves are often covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Jacobaea frondosa is part of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and medicinal properties in some species."
