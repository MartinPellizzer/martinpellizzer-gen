    "intro": "Juncus mertensianus var. duranii, commonly known as the Duran's rush, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems that grow in dense clusters, often reaching heights of up to 2 feet. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils, typically found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization and habitat for various wildlife species."
