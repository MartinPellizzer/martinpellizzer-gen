    "intro": "Jurinea monocephala subsp. sintenisii, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers during the spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xerophytic conditions and it is often found in open, rocky habitats."
