    "intro": "Juniperus struthiacea, commonly known as the cliff juniper, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and small mammals. The plant is adapted to harsh, rocky environments and is often found growing on cliffs, slopes, and in desert scrub habitats. Its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
