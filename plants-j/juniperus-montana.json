    "intro": "Juniperus montana, commonly known as the mountain juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, which consists of scale-like leaves arranged in dense clusters. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are typically blue or purple in color, containing toxic seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Juniperus montana plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
