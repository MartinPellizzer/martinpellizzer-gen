    "intro": "Julocroton rupestris var. arenosus, commonly known as the sand croton, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa. It features fleshy, ribbed stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, enabling it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a vibrant touch to its otherwise muted appearance. It prefers well-draining soil and full sun exposure, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its unique morphology and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
