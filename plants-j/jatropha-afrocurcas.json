    "intro": "Jatropha afrocurcas, commonly known as the African croton, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that contain toxic seeds, making it potentially harmful if ingested. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along forest edges. Despite its toxicity, it has been studied for its potential in biofuel production due to its high oil content."
