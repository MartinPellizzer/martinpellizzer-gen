It typically grows in moist to wet environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form dense clumps, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of brownish or reddish flowers. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize soil in wetland ecosystems. Juncus slwookoorum plays an important role in filtering water and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
