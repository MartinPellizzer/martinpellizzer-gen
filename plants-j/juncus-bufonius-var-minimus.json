    "intro": "Juncus bufonius var. minimus, commonly known as the dwarf bog rush, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically forms dense clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its compact size and ability to stabilize soil, it is a valuable plant for wetland restoration projects."
