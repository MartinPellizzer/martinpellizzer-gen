It is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has a straight trunk with a smooth, reddish-bark that becomes fissured with age. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. Jacobinia ramosissima is also noted for its fragrant flowers, which bloom in clusters and attract various pollinators."
