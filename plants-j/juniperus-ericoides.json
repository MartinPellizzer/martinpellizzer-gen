    "intro": "Juniperus ericoides, commonly known as creeping juniper, is a shrub native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing form with scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for various birds and mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Juniperus ericoides is valued for its ornamental use in landscaping and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
