    "intro": "Jurinea natmataungensis, commonly known as the Burmese sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Myanmar. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces clusters of tiny white or pale pink flowers during the rainy season. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or semi-arid habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
