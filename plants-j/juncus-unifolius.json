    "intro": "Juncus unifolius, commonly known as the narrowleaf rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 millimeter wide. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of greenish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. Juncus unifolius plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
