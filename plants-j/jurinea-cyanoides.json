    "intro": "Jurinea cyanoides, commonly known as the blue sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean and parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, silvery-gray leaves that are adapted to tolerate salty sea air and sandy soils. It thrives in well-drained environments and is often found growing along dunes or rocky shores. Jurinea cyanoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal ecosystems."
