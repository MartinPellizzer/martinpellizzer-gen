    "intro": "Jussiaea repens subsp. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth trailing jussiaea, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to South America. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. The plant features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its small, elliptical leaves are smooth and often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, and are usually clustered in small inflorescences."
