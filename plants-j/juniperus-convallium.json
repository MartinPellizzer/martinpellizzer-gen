    "intro": "Juniperus convallium, commonly known as the creeping juniper, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and small mammals. Juniperus convallium thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for landscaping in arid or coastal regions."
