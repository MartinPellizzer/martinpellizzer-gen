    "intro": "Juncus perparvus, commonly known as the dwarf rush, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often densely packed. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, usually found at the tips of the stems. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and contributes to the ecological health of wetland environments. Juncus perparvus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions."
