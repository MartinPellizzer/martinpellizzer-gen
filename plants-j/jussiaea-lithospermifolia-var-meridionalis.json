It is characterized by its erect stems and small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and summer seasons. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in ecological and horticultural contexts."
