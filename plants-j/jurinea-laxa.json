    "intro": "Jurinea laxa, commonly known as the slender sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils near the shore. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Jurinea laxa is well adapted to salty sea winds and is often used in coastal landscaping for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
