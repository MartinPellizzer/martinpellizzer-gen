    "intro": "Jurinea nevskii, commonly known as the Nevskii's sea bladder, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Arctic and subarctic. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, bladder-like structures that store water. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it can tolerate harsh environmental conditions. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish-white in color and appear in clusters. Jurinea nevskii plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
