It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its flowers attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and butterflies, due to their nectar-rich structure.
