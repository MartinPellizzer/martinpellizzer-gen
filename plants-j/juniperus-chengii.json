    "intro": "Juniperus chengii, commonly known as Cheng's juniper, is a species of evergreen conifer native to China. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Juniperus chengii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture."
