    "intro": "Justicia incerta, commonly known as the false arum, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spatulate-shaped leaves and showy, clustered inflorescences. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some areas."
