    "intro": "Jatropha palustris, commonly known as swamp croton, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas of the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in marshy or poorly drained soils. The plant features alternate, heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of yellow-orange flowers that attract pollinators. Its seeds are encased in a fleshy, spiky capsule that splits open when mature. Jatropha palustris is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate waterlogged conditions."
