    "intro": "Justicia bispinosa, commonly known as the two-spined justicia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves with two spines at the base. The plant produces clusters of showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, attracting pollinators like bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a popular choice in arid landscapes."
