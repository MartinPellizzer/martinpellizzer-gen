    "intro": "Jacobaea paludosa subsp. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved marsh ragwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant features a rosette of basal, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow, arranged in a single head, and are borne on tall, slender stems. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in wet conditions and its distinctive leaf morphology."
