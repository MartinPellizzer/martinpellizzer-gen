    "intro": "Jurinea meda, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is characterized by its blue or violet flowers and silvery, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing in dunes or along shorelines. Its structure is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, with a compact growth form and deep root systems. Jurinea meda plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal sands and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
