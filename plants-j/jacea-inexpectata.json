    "intro": "Jacea inexpectata, commonly known as the unexpected jacea, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive yellow-orange composite flowers. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Jacea inexpectata is considered endangered."
