    "intro": "Jurinea sangardensis, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or inland dunes. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, which bloom during the warmer months. It has a low-growing habit with hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves adapted to reduce water loss. Jurinea sangardensis is well-suited to harsh environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
