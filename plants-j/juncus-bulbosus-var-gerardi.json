    "intro": "Juncus bulbosus var. gerardi, commonly known as the Gerardi bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in dense clusters, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with cylindrical, hollow stems that are often reddish in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil in marshy environments, making it an important species for wetland restoration. It is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and lakes."
