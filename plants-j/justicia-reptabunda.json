    "intro": "Justicia reptabunda, commonly known as the creeping justicia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as swamps and riverbanks. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink or purple. Its flowering period usually occurs during the warm seasons, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant's rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, making it both a valuable ornamental and an invasive species in some areas."
