    "intro": "Juniperus ovata, commonly known as the oval juniper, is a species of coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, providing a striking visual contrast to its dark, woody branches. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for various birds and small mammals. Juniperus ovata thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or coastal environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in regions with a temperate climate."
