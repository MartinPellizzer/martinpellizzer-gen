    "intro": "Jurinea pineticola, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant features small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, appearing in clusters during the summer months. Jurinea pineticola plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native ecosystems and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds."
