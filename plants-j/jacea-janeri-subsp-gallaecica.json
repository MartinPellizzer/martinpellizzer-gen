    "intro": "Jacea janeri subsp. gallaecica, commonly known as the Galician jacea, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the Galicia region of Spain. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic compounds and often hollow stems. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along stream banks and in shaded woodlands. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, with white to pale pink petals, and it blooms during the spring months. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
