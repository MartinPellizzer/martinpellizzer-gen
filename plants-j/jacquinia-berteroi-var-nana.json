    "intro": "Jacquinia berteroi var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf jacquinia, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white to pale pink, typically in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely packed, giving it a compact appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate blooms and ability to form attractive groundcovers in shaded environments."
