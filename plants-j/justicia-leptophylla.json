    "intro": "Justicia leptophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf false arum, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, often colorful bracts that resemble those of true arums. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences, with showy calyces that serve as a visual attraction for pollinators. Justicia leptophylla is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of tropical and subtropical conditions."
