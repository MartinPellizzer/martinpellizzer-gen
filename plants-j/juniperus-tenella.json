    "intro": "Juniperus tenella, commonly known as the cliffbracken juniper, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and compact growth habit, which allows it to thrive in rocky and coastal environments. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. Its aromatic leaves and resilience to harsh conditions make it a popular choice for landscaping in dry, sunny areas. Juniperus tenella is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in difficult terrain."
