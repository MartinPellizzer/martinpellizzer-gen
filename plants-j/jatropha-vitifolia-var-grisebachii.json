It is characterized by its distinctive grayish-green, hairy leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces capsule fruits containing toxic seeds, which are a key feature in its botanical classification. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments.
