    "intro": "Juno scorpioides, commonly known as the African rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a dense spike, which bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Juno scorpioides is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
