    "intro": "Jurinea monardii, commonly known as the narrowleaf fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and grayish-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. Jurinea monardii produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
