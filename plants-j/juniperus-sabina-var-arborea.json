    "intro": "Juniperus sabina var. arborea, commonly known as the tree juniper, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to the eastern United States. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 feet and has a narrow, upright form with scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and small mammals. Its dense foliage makes it suitable for hedges or ornamental planting in gardens. The wood is aromatic and has been historically used for crafting and as a source of juniper berries."
