    "intro": "Justicia petraea, commonly known as the rock jewel or desert jewel, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments. The plant produces vibrant blue or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Justicia petraea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
