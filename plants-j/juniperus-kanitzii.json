    "intro": "Juniperus kanitzii, commonly known as the Kanitz juniper, is a species of juniper native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a small evergreen shrub or tree that typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils. The plant features scale-like leaves that are tightly pressed against the stems, giving it a dense, compact appearance. Its cones, which are small and berry-like, contain aromatic seeds that are used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in harsh, arid environments."
