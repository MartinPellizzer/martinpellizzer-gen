    "intro": "Juniperus sabina var. taurica, commonly known as the Tauric juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and southwestern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. This variety is noted for its hardiness and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
