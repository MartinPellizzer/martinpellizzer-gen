It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a simple morphology with leafy shoots that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. Its sporophytes are short and robust, bearing capsules that release spores for reproduction. Jupunba auriculata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecological niche."
