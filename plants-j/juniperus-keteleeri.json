    "intro": "Juniperus keteleeri, commonly known as the Keteleer juniper, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Juniperus keteleeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and attractive foliage."
