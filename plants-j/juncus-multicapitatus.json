    "intro": "Juncus multicapitatus, commonly known as the many-headed rush, is a perennial plant native to the wetlands of North America. It is characterized by its dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves and its distinctive flowering heads that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often in marshes, swamps, or along the edges of ponds. Its inflorescence consists of multiple small, spike-like clusters of flowers, which are often greenish or reddish in color. Juncus multicapitatus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
