    "intro": "Juglans mandshurica f. coarctata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved black walnut, is a botanical variant of the black walnut species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and smaller, more compact fruits compared to the typical black walnut. The plant produces hard, thick-shelled nuts enclosed in a spiny husk, which are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. This subspecies is valued for its timber and has limited cultivation due to its specific environmental requirements."
