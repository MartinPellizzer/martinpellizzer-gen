    "intro": "Jurinea elbursensis, commonly known as the Elburz sandflower, is a flowering plant native to the Elburz Mountains in Iran. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, and its leaves are adapted to reduce water loss. It possesses a robust root system that helps it survive in sandy and nutrient-poor soils. Jurinea elbursensis plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and is an important part of the local flora."
