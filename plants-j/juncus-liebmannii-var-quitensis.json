    "intro": "Juncus liebmannii var. quitensis, commonly known as the Quitense rush, is a perennial plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit, typically forming dense mats on rocky or gravelly slopes. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers, typical of many rush species. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized plant with ecological significance in its native habitat."
