    "intro": "Jatropha pruinosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf jatropha, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive velvety appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by green, spiny capsules containing toxic seeds. Jatropha pruinosa is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. It has been studied for its potential in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals from the soil."
