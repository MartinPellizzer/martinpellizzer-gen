    "intro": "Juniperus horizontalis f. variegata, commonly known as creeping juniper with variegation, is a compact, low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. Its foliage consists of small, scale-like leaves that are typically bright green, with some cultivars exhibiting striking variegation of white or yellow margins. The plant produces blue-gray berries that are edible but often used for ornamental purposes. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Due to its slow growth and hardy nature, it is well-suited for xeriscaping and coastal landscapes."
