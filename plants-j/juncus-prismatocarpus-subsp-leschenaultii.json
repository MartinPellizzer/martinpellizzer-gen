    "intro": "Juncus prismatocarpus subsp. leschenaultii, commonly known as the Leschenault's rush, is a flowering plant belonging to the Juncaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is typically found in wet or marshy habitats, thriving in areas with consistent moisture."
