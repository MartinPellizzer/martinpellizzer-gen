    "intro": "Julocroton ramboi, commonly known as the Red-veined Caper, is a striking tropical shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, waxy leaves with prominent red veins that create a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and greenhouses. However, it requires well-drained soil and partial shade to thrive successfully."
