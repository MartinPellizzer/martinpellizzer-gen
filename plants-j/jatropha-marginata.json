    "intro": "Jatropha marginata, commonly known as the margined spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its simple, alternate leaves with a distinctive white or pale margin. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by greenish, fleshy fruits that turn red when mature. Jatropha marginata is known for its latex sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation, making it important to handle with care. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and resilience in various environmental conditions."
