    "intro": "Jacaratia heptaphylla, commonly known as the seven-leaf jacaratia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a smooth, dark green upper surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, spherical berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Jacaratia heptaphylla thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded forest understories. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions."
