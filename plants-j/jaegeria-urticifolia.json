    "intro": "Jaegeria urticifolia, commonly known as the stinging nettle plant, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, irritating hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, spherical fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and waste grounds. Due to its stinging hairs, it is sometimes considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
