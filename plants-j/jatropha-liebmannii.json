    "intro": "Jatropha liebmannii, commonly known as the Liebmann's physic nut, is a species of flowering plant in the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its spiny stems and leaves, and it produces yellowish-green flowers that develop into orange-red capsules containing toxic seeds. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in shrublands and woodlands. Due to its toxicity, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
