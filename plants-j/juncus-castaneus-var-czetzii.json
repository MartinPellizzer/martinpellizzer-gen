The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate floral display. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic habitats."
