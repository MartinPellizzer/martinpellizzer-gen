    "intro": "Jasione sessiliflora subsp. serpentinica, commonly known as the serpentine jasione, is a flowering plant native to rocky, nutrient-poor soils of the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The subspecies is adapted to thrive in serpentine soils, which are rich in heavy metals and low in essential nutrients. Its leaves are typically narrow and sessile, and the flowers are usually pale yellow or white. This plant plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is of interest in ecological and botanical studies."
