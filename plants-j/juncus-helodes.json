    "intro": "Juncus helodes, commonly known as the narrowleaf rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America. It typically grows in dense clusters, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with slender, grass-like leaves that are often dark green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers in summer, which are arranged in spikes. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic habitats. Juncus helodes is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels and poor soil conditions."
