    "intro": "Juniperus terminalis, commonly known as the Rocky Mountain juniper, is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, providing a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Juniperus terminalis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native fauna."
