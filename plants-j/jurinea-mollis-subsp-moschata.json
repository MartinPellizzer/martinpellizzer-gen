    "intro": "Jurinea mollis subsp. moschata, commonly known as the musky sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white or pale pink. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. Its fragrance is often described as musky or resinous, which may play a role in attracting pollinators. It is typically found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations."
