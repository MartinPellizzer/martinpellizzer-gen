    "intro": "Juniperus henryana, commonly known as Henry's juniper, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the mountainous regions of western China. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 meters and is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that are dark green and covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Juniperus henryana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and winter interest."
