    "intro": "Juniperus repanda, commonly known as the Himalayan juniper, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub or small tree native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and needle-like leaves that are blue-green in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are typically dark blue or black when mature. It thrives in cold, dry climates and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Juniperus repanda is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
