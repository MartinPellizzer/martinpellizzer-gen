    "intro": "Jeffreya decurrens, commonly known as the creeping marsh grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland environments in North America. It features slender, rhizomatous stems that spread horizontally along the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Jeffreya decurrens plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates in its wetland habitat."
