    "intro": "Juncus muelleri subsp. grubovii, commonly known as the Grubov's rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in wet or waterlogged soils, often found in swampy areas, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that are usually unbranched and covered in small, scale-like leaves. Its flowering spikes consist of numerous tiny, spikelet-like flowers that are often green or brown in color. This subspecies is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
