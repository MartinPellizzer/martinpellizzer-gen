    "intro": "Juncus inflexus subsp. austrooccidentalis, commonly known as the western bentgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it relies on wind pollination. The subspecies is characterized by its slightly curved stems and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological adaptability."
