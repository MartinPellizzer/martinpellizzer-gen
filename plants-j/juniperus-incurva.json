    "intro": "Juniperus incurva, commonly known as the creeping juniper, is a shrub-like evergreen conifer native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, dense foliage and small, scale-like leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces tiny, berry-like cones that are typically dark blue when mature, containing toxic seeds. Juniperus incurva is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils. It is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value."
