    "intro": "Juniperus squamata var. variegata, commonly known as the variegated red cedar, is a compact evergreen shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like foliage that exhibits a striking variegation of white, yellow, and green. The leaves are typically flat and emit a subtle, resinous fragrance. It produces small, berry-like cones that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens."
