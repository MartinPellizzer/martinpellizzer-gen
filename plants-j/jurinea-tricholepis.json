    "intro": "Jurinea tricholepis, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Europe. It is characterized by its silver-blue foliage and striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to salt-laden winds and coastal conditions. Its narrow, linear leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Jurinea tricholepis is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and its ability to tolerate harsh, coastal climates."
