    "intro": "Justicia lutensis, commonly known as the waterwheel plant, is a striking aquatic plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of narrow, grass-like leaves that resemble the spokes of a wheel. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, and purple, which bloom sequentially along the stems. It thrives in shallow, still waters and is often found in marshes and ponds. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in water gardens and botanical collections."
