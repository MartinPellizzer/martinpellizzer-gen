    "intro": "Jussiaea palustris, commonly known as marsh willow or water willow, is a semi-aquatic plant native to wetland and marsh environments in temperate regions. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often covered in soft, fuzzy hairs, and its leaves are narrow and linear. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, arranged in clusters. Jussiaea palustris plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
