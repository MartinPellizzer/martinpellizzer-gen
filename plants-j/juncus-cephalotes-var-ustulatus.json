    "intro": "Juncus cephalotes var. ustulatus, commonly known as the scorched rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It features tall, slender cylindrical stems that are often reddish-brown in color, particularly at the base. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in dense clusters near the top of the stems, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, growing in dense tufts at the base of the plant. This variety is adapted to tolerate periodic flooding and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds."
