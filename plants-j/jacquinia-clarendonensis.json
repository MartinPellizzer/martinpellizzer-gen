    "intro": "Jacquinia clarendonensis, commonly known as the Clarendon heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean island of Jamaica. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in whorls around the stems. It produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in the spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Jacquinia clarendonensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
