    "intro": "Juncus glaucus var. leptocarpus, commonly known as the slender fruit rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale green to white flowers, which are often subtended by bracts. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland environments. This variety is distinguished by its slender, elongated fruits compared to other juncus species."
