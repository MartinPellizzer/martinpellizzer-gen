    "intro": "Juncus rigidus, commonly known as stiff rush, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and tall, cylindrical spikelets that bear small, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Juncus rigidus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions."
