    "intro": "Jurinea consanguinea subsp. bulgarica, commonly known as the Bulgarian sand mustard, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in coastal and inland dunes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by elongated pods containing seeds. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is of interest in ecological restoration projects."
