    "intro": "Jumellea neglecta, commonly known as the narrowleaf jumellea, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and has slender, branching stems covered in fine, hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slight reddish tint, and are adapted to reduce water loss. Jumellea neglecta is well-suited to rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, open habitats."
