    "intro": "Juncus supinus subsp. eusupinus, commonly known as the upright rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant features tall, cylindrical stems that are usually unbranched and covered in narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of dense clusters of small, three-lobed flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
