    "intro": "Juncus bufonius frondescens, commonly known as the frog's-bit sedge, is a perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and compact, spike-like flower clusters that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of aquatic ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize shorelines. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, including providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
