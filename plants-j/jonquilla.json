    "intro": "Jonquilla, commonly known as the golden crocus, is a species of flowering plant in the Iridaceae family. It is native to the Mediterranean region and is characterized by its bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers. The plant produces a single, erect stem that bears the flower at the top, with narrow, grass-like leaves below. Jonquilla thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. It is also valued for its ornamental beauty and historical use in perfumery."
