    "intro": "Juncus, commonly known as rush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Juncaginaceae. These plants are typically found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. They are characterized by their tall, cylindrical stems that are often hollow and covered in fine, grass-like leaves. Juncus species vary in height and growth habit, with some forming dense mats and others growing as upright shrubs. Many species are used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
