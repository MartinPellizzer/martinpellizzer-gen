    "intro": "Jania breyniana, commonly known as the red algae or coral tree, is a species of red algae belonging to the family Rhodophyceae. It is characterized by its branching, coral-like structure and vibrant red coloration, which is due to the presence of phycoerythrin, a pigment that aids in light absorption. This marine organism is typically found in shallow tropical and subtropical waters, often attached to hard substrates such as rocks or coral. Its thallus consists of a complex network of filaments that provide structural support and facilitate nutrient absorption. Jania breyniana plays an important ecological role in marine ecosystems by contributing to biodiversity and serving as a food source for various marine organisms."
