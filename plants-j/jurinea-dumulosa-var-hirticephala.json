    "intro": "Jurinea dumulosa var. hirticephala, commonly known as the hairy-headed sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and limited water availability. The plant features small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, and its leaves are covered in fine, hairy structures that help reduce water loss. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitat. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in xerophytic gardens."
