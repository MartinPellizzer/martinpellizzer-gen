    "intro": "Jurinea cephalopoda, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive blue or purple flower heads, which are surrounded by bracts that resemble leaves. The plant thrives in coastal environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, forming a composite structure that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Jurinea cephalopoda is well adapted to saline and windy conditions, making it a resilient species in marine ecosystems."
