    "intro": "Jatropha somalensis, commonly known as the Somali physic nut, is a shrub native to the Horn of Africa. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red berries containing toxic seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for agricultural purposes."
