    "intro": "Justicia tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly false heather, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, woolly gray-green foliage and showy clusters of tubular, bright pink or red flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by hummingbirds and bees, making it an important plant for pollinators. The plant is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive appearance and drought tolerance once established."
