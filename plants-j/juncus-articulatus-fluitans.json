    "intro": "Juncus articulatus fluitans, commonly known as the floating rush, is a herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, grass-like stems that float on the surface of still or slow-moving freshwater. It has narrow, linear leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged, with the upper portions remaining above water. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish or brownish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in wetland environments, including ponds, marshes, and the edges of lakes. Due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life, it plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems."
