    "intro": "Juniperus angosturana, commonly known as the Angostura juniper, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Andes mountains of South America. It typically grows at high elevations, often in rocky or mountainous terrain, and is adapted to cold, dry conditions. The plant has scale-like leaves that are closely appressed to the branches, and it produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate climates. The species is also notable for its role in traditional medicine among indigenous communities."
