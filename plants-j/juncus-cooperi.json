    "intro": "Juncus cooperi, commonly known as Cooper's rush, is a perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that forms compact, upright clumps. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that emerge from the leaf axils in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils, making it a common sight in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Cooper's rush is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
