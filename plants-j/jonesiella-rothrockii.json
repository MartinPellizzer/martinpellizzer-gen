    "intro": "Jonesiella rothrockii, commonly known as the Rothrock's jonesiella, is a rare and unique fern species native to the Appalachian Mountains. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered along the undersides of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Jonesiella rothrockii is considered a species of conservation concern."
