    "intro": "Juncus australis, commonly known as the Australian rush, is a perennial plant native to Australia and New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves that form a compact, upright growth habit. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, consist of small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Juncus australis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
