    "intro": "Juncus tenuis var. platycaulos, commonly known as the broadstem rush, is a perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which are usually greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams. This variety is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic wildlife."
