It consists of only one species, Jubilaria monogyna, which is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale pink. It produces small, round pods that contain several seeds, and it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Jubilaria is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
