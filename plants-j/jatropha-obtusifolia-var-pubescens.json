    "intro": "Jatropha obtusifolia var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy jatropha, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It features hairy, ovate leaves with a rough texture and a distinctive reddish or purple stem. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that develop into spiny, three-chambered fruits. Its latex sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, making handling cautionary. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking foliage and unique appearance."
