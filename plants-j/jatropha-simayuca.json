    "intro": "Jatropha simayuca, commonly known as the red-flowered jatropha, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking red-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a rough texture. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds covered in a sticky substance. Jatropha simayuca is also known for its potential as a source of biofuel due to the oil content in its seeds."
