    "intro": "Juglans petiolata, commonly known as the slender walnut, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the walnut family, Juglandaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves with long petioles. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by oval, edible nuts encased in a thick, woody husk. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it can grow up to 20 meters tall. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its potential as a nut-producing species."
