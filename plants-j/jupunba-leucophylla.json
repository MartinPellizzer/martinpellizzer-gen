    "intro": "Jupunba leucophylla, commonly known as the white-leafed jupunba, is a unique plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its pale, almost white, velvety leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in the spring. Jupunba leucophylla is adapted to cold, nutrient-poor soils and thrives in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its natural range."
