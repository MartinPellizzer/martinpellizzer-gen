    "intro": "Jurinea nivea, commonly known as the snowbell, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue in color. The plant thrives in alpine environments, where it is adapted to cold temperatures and well-drained soil. Its leaves are usually small and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Jurinea nivea is often found growing in rocky or gravelly habitats at high elevations."
