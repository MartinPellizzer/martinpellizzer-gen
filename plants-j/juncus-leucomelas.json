It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically light green to white in color, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes during the summer months. It is often found in shallow water or moist soil, contributing to the structure and biodiversity of wetland ecosystems. Juncus leucomelas plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
