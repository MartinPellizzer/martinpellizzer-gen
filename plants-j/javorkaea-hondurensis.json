It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
