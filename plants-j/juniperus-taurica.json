    "intro": "Juniperus taurica, commonly known as the Tauric juniper, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the southern coast of the Black Sea. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves and small, berry-like cones that mature to a dark blue color. The plant is well adapted to arid and coastal environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. It produces aromatic foliage that contains essential oils, contributing to its use in traditional medicine and as a source of juniper berries. Juniperus taurica is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
