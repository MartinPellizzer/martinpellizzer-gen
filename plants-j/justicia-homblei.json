    "intro": "Justicia homblei, commonly known as the silverleaf justicia, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It features lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, often arranged in clusters at the ends of branches. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and garden landscapes."
