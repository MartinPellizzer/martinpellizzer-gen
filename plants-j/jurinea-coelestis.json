    "intro": "Jurinea coelestis, commonly known as the skyblue flowering plant, is a low-growing perennial that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. It is characterized by its narrow, silver-gray leaves and clusters of small, sky-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in harsh, dry climates. It is native to regions of southern Europe and parts of Asia, including the Mediterranean and the Middle East. Its unique appearance and hardiness make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
