    "intro": "Juniperus phoenicea var. turbinata, commonly known as the Turban Juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that forms compact, rounded clusters. The leaves are scale-like and dark green, providing a dense canopy. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas."
