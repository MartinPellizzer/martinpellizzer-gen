    "intro": "Juncus marginatus var. setosus, commonly known as the hairy rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, cylindrical leaves that are often covered in fine, bristly hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in spike-like clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist to waterlogged soils and is often found in marshes, pond margins, and along streams. Due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life, it plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
