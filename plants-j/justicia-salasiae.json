    "intro": "Justicia salasiae, commonly known as the Salasia flameflower, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a velvety texture. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, especially hummingbirds, due to their bright colors and nectar-rich structure."
