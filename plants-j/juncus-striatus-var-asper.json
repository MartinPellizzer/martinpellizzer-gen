    "intro": "Juncus striatus var. asper, commonly known as the rough flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, linear leaves that are rough to the touch, as indicated by its varietal name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. Due to its adaptability and ecological importance, it plays a key role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
