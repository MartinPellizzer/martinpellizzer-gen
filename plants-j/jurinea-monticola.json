    "intro": "Jurinea monticola, commonly known as the mountain jurinea, is a flowering plant belonging to the Amaranthaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia, including parts of the Tibetan Plateau and the Himalayas. The plant is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers and succulent, hairy leaves adapted to arid and cold environments. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its unique adaptations, Jurinea monticola is an important indicator species for high-altitude ecosystems."
