    "intro": "Johannesteijsmannia magnifica, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a large, ancient plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its massive, pinnately compound leaves that can reach lengths of over 5 meters. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It is a slow-growing species that can live for hundreds of years. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN."
