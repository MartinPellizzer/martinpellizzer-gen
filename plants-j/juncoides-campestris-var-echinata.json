    "intro": "Juncoides campestris var. echinata, commonly known as the spiny rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its dense clusters of grass-like leaves. It features slender, cylindrical stems that often grow in moist or wetland environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a rough, textured surface. This variety is often found in marshy areas and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wetland organisms."
