    "intro": "Juncus amuricus, commonly known as the Amur rush, is a perennial plant native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like flower heads. The plant typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. It has a robust rhizomatous root system that allows it to thrive in waterlogged soils. Juncus amuricus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
