    "intro": "Juniperus oxycedrus var. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf juniper or rock juniper, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, needle-like foliage that is typically dark green, providing year-round visual interest. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and as a hardy ornamental plant. Its slow growth rate and resilience to drought and poor soil conditions make it a popular choice for landscaping in arid climates."
