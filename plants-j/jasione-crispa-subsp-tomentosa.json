It features hairy, gray-green foliage and produces showy blue or violet flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils, often in alpine or subalpine regions. Its subspecies status highlights subtle differences in morphology compared to the main species, particularly in leaf and stem hairiness. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
