    "intro": "Jacaranda caucana subsp. sandwithiana, commonly known as the Sandwith's jacaranda, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly the Bahamas and Cuba. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its drooping branches and dense canopy. The leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant produces showy, violet-blue flower clusters during the summer months. Its ornamental value is due to its vibrant flowers and ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates. The species is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been used historically in construction and furniture-making."
