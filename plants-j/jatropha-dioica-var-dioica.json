    "intro": "Jatropha dioica var. dioica, commonly known as the two-rowed spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange or red berries containing toxic seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
