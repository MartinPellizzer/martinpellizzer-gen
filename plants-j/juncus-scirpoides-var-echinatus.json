    "intro": "Juncus scirpoides var. echinatus, commonly known as the spiny rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and moist soils in North America. It features tall, cylindrical stems that are often reddish-brown in color, and it produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy. Its distinctive feature is the presence of short, sharp spines on the flowering spikes, which give it its common name. This plant plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
