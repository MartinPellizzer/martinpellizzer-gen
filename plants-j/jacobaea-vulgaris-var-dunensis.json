    "intro": "Jacobaea vulgaris var. dunensis, commonly known as the Scottish ragwort, is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to the British Isles. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and features yellow flowers that bloom from June to August. The plant has dark green, slightly hairy leaves that are alternate and often have a slightly serrated edge. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, heaths, and along roadsides. This variety is considered a potential weed and can be toxic to livestock due to the presence of pyrrolizidine alkaloids."
