It is characterized by its fragrant white flowers and trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets. The plant typically grows as a climbing shrub or vine, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its flowers bloom in clusters and emit a sweet, aromatic scent, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
