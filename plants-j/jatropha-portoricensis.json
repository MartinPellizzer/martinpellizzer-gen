    "intro": "Jatropha portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial plant characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain toxic seeds, which are a defense mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands. Jatropha portoricensis plays a role in local ecosystems but is also considered an invasive species in some regions."
