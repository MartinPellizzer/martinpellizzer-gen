    "intro": "Jatropha chacoana, commonly known as the Chaco croton, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in parts of Argentina, Bolivia, and Paraguay. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which is known for its diverse and often toxic species. The plant features alternate, ovate leaves with a rough texture and produces small, clustered yellow flowers. Jatropha chacoana is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage and unique floral structure. However, like many species in its family, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
