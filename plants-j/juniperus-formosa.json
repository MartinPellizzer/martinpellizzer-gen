    "intro": "Juniperus formosa, commonly known as the creeping juniper, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It features scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, arranged in dense, compact clusters. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and small mammals. Juniperus formosa is well adapted to rocky and dry environments, often forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Its slow growth rate and resilience make it a popular choice for landscaping in arid regions."
