    "intro": "Juniperus thurifera subsp. thurifera, commonly known as the Canary Island juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color and arranged in whorls. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid climate of its native habitat. This subspecies is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping."
