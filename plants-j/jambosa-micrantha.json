    "intro": "Jambosa micrantha, commonly known as the dwarf starfruit, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, star-shaped fruits. The fruit is edible, with a tart flavor and a texture similar to that of a starfruit, though it is less commonly cultivated than its larger relatives. It is often grown for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and unique fruit."
