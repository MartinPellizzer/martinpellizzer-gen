    "intro": "Juncus rudis, commonly known as the common rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments across Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its dense clusters of grass-like, cylindrical leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in spike-like inflorescences at the top of the stems. Juncus rudis thrives in moist or waterlogged soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
