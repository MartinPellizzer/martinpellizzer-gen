    "intro": "Juncus verticillatus var. fluitans, commonly known as the floating rush, is a variant of the common rush that exhibits aquatic adaptations. It is characterized by its clustered, cylindrical stems that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in water. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming dense mats on the water's surface. This variant is valued for its ability to stabilize water bodies and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
