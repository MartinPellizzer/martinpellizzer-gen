    "intro": "Jacquiniella miserrima, commonly known as the weeping lily, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its slender, drooping stems and pale pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Jacquiniella miserrima is adapted to cool, humid environments and thrives in well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
