    "intro": "Jacobaea vulgaris subsp. gotlandica, commonly known as Gotland's groundsel, is a perennial herb native to the Baltic region, particularly Gotland. It typically grows in dry, calcareous soils and is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in composite inflorescences, which are typical of the Asteraceae family. It is a low-growing plant with a compact habit, often reaching heights of less than 30 cm. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
