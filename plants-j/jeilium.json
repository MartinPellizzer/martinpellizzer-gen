    "intro": "Jeilium, commonly known as the moonflower, is a unique plant characterized by its large, white, night-blooming flowers. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is native to tropical regions. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers open only at night, releasing a sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. Jeilium is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
