    "intro": "Jasonia glutinosa subsp. congesta, commonly known as the sticky jasonia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, glandular hairs that give it a sticky texture, which is a notable botanical feature. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typical of the Rutaceae family. Its leaves are usually opposite and oval-shaped, with a somewhat leathery texture. This subspecies is often found in rocky or sandy soils, adapting well to arid and semi-arid environments."
