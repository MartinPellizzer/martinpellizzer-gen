    "intro": "Justicia parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic justicia, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Acanthaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the stems of other plants through specialized root structures called haustoria. The plant produces strikingly showy flowers that are often clustered in terminal inflorescences, ranging in color from white to purple. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host, making it a potential concern in agricultural settings."
