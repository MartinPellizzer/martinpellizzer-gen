    "intro": "Jatropha parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved physic nut, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain toxic seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it adaptable to various environmental conditions. Its ornamental value is sometimes appreciated, though caution is advised due to the toxicity of its parts."
