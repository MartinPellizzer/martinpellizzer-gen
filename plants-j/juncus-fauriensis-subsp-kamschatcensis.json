    "intro": "Juncus fauriensis subsp. kamschatcensis, commonly known as the Kamchatka rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of the Russian Far East. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, often growing in dense clusters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing greenish-yellow flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to thrive in moist, saline environments. This subspecies is well-suited to coastal dunes and salt marshes, demonstrating a high degree of ecological resilience."
