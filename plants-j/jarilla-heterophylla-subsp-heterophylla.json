It is characterized by its sprawling growth habit and compound leaves that are often lobed or divided. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale purple to white in color. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its fibrous root system allows it to survive in harsh, drought-prone conditions."
