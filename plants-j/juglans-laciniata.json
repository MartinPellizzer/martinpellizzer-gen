    "intro": "Juglans laciniata, commonly known as the splitleaf walnut, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its deeply lobed leaves, which give it its common name, and its distinctive, rugged bark. The tree produces large, green, inedible fruits that contain hard, woody nuts. Its flowers are dioecious, with separate male and female plants, and it relies on wind pollination. The wood of Juglans laciniata is strong and durable, making it valuable for woodworking and furniture making."
