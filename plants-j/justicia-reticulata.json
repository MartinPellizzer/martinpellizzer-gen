    "intro": "Justicia reticulata, commonly known as the red hot poker or torch flower, is a striking perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescences that bear bright red or orange tubular flowers, which are highly attractive to pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. The plant has lance-shaped, opposite leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden borders and containers. Its ornamental value is further enhanced by its ability to bloom throughout the growing season in warm climates."
