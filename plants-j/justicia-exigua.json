    "intro": "Justicia exigua, commonly known as the dwarf flame flower, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its small, glossy leaves and clusters of bright red, tubular flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-draining soil. It is often used in ornamental gardening for its vibrant color and compact growth habit. Justicia exigua is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees."
