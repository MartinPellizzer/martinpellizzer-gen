    "intro": "Juniperus gallica, commonly known as the common juniper, is a evergreen shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for various birds and animals. Juniperus gallica is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. Its aromatic foliage and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice in gardens and as a hedge plant."
