    "intro": "Jarava ruiz-lealii, commonly known as the desert grass or jarava, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Jarava ruiz-lealii plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
