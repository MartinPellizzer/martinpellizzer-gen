    "intro": "Juniperus virginiana var. pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramid juniper, is a variety of the eastern red cedar. It is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. This plant has a narrow, conical shape with scale-like leaves that are blue-gray in color. It produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and small mammals. The plant is valued for its ornamental use in landscaping due to its compact form and year-round foliage."
