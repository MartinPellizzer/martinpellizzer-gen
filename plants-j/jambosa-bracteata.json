    "intro": "Jambosa bracteata, commonly known as the African star apple, is a tropical plant native to Africa, particularly found in regions like Nigeria and Tanzania. It is a small evergreen tree that typically grows to a height of 5 to 10 meters, featuring dense foliage and a compact canopy. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, star-shaped fruits with a sweet, juicy pulp. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical, with a smooth texture and a dark green color. Jambosa bracteata is valued not only for its fruit but also for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal uses."
