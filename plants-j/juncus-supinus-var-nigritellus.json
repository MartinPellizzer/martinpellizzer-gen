It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant features slender, dark green stems that are often tinged with purple or black, giving it its distinctive appearance. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are arranged in dense tufts, and it produces small, clustered flowers in early to mid-summer. This variety is notable for its adaptability to waterlogged soils and its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
