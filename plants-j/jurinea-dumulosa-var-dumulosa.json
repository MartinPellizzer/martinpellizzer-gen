    "intro": "Jurinea dumulosa var. dumulosa, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and alpine regions. It forms dense, mat-like growths that help it survive in harsh environments by reducing water loss and protecting against extreme temperatures. The plant has small, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which further aid in water conservation. It produces yellow flowers in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This species is well adapted to rocky soils and is often found in mountainous areas with limited moisture."
