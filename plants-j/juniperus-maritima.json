    "intro": "Juniperus maritima, commonly known as maritime juniper, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and coastal winds. Maritime juniper is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to stabilize dunes."
