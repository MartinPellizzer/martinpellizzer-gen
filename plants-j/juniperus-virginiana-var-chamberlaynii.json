    "intro": "Juniperus virginiana var. chamberlaynii, commonly known as the Eastern red cedar, is a shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, scale-like leaves and produces small, blue-black berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. The plant is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy soils. It has a slow growth rate and can live for several decades, often forming dense thickets in its native habitat. Its botanical features make it an important component of many southeastern ecosystems."
