    "intro": "Juncus lampocarpus, commonly known as the redstem sedgewort, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, rocky habitats such as streambanks and meadows. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale to dark red flowers. Its inflorescence is distinctive, with the flowers arranged in a spike that becomes increasingly red as it matures. Juncus lampocarpus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environment."
