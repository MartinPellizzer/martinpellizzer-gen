It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes eucalyptus and tea trees. The plant is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces small, white or pale pink flowers. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Jennyella sanderi is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy choice for dry gardens."
