    "intro": "Jirawongsea, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a unique flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, silver-green foliage and delicate, fragrant blooms. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in its natural habitat. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, which is essential for its survival in humid environments. Jirawongsea is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
