    "intro": "Justicia pulcherrima, commonly known as the flame flower or red hot poker, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom in dense clusters, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 feet, with lance-shaped, glossy green leaves. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes in warm climates."
