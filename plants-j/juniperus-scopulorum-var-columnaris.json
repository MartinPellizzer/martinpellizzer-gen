    "intro": "Juniperus scopulorum var. columnaris, commonly known as the Rocky Mountain juniper, is a variant of the Rocky Mountain juniper native to the western United States. It is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree characterized by its narrow, columnar growth habit. The plant has scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. It is adapted to dry, rocky environments and is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
