    "intro": "Jurinea monoclona, commonly known as the coastal sandflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid and coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is a small, herbaceous annual that thrives in sandy and saline soils, often found along shorelines and dunes. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Jurinea monoclona plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion."
