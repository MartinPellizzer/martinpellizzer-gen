    "intro": "Jacquemontia serpyllifolia, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves with a waxy texture and produces delicate, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant typically grows along the ground, forming a dense mat through its spreading stems and stolons. Its flowers open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and shaded areas."
