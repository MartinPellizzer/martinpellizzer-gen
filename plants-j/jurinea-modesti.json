    "intro": "Jurinea modesti, commonly known as the modest sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes and rocky shores. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Jurinea modesti is well adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient species in harsh coastal environments."
