    "intro": "Jatropha acerifolia, commonly known as the maple-leafed euphorbia, is a shrub native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its striking, maple-like leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange-red berries containing toxic seeds. Jatropha acerifolia is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid regions. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness."
