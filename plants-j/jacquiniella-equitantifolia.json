    "intro": "Jacquiniella equitantifolia, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers and its unique, twisted leaves that give it its scientific name. The plant is a member of the Rutaceae family, which includes other aromatic plants like citrus. Its wood is highly valued for its rich reddish color and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in traditional craftsmanship. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species."
