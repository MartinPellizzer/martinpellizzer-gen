It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered with fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Jarava subplumosa is typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
