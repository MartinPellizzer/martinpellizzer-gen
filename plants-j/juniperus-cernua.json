    "intro": "Juniperus cernua, commonly known as creeping juniper, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to North America. It typically forms dense mats or cascading branches, often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are dark green and retain their color year-round. Its cones, which are berry-like, are typically blue or purple and contain toxic seeds. Juniperus cernua is valued for its ornamental use in landscaping and its ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
