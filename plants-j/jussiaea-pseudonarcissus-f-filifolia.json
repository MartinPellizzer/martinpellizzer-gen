It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as forests or along stream banks. It is a perennial herb that spreads through rhizomes, forming dense mats. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in plant morphology and ecology."
