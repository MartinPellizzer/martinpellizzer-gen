    "intro": "Jussiaea suffruticosa var. hirta, commonly known as the hairy willow or swamp willow, is a shrub native to wetland environments in South America. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems covered in short, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins, typical of the Salicaceae family. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in moist habitats. Jussiaea suffruticosa var. hirta is adapted to thrive in marshy or periodically flooded areas, making it an important component of riparian ecosystems."
