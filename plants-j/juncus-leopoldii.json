    "intro": "Juncus leopoldii, commonly known as Leopold's rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical spikes of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Juncus leopoldii is often found in wetland ecosystems and is an important component of native plant communities."
