    "intro": "Jatropha triphylla, commonly known as the three-leaf jatropha, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged symmetrically around a central stem. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange or red berries containing toxic seeds. Jatropha triphylla is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
