    "intro": "Juniperus poblana, commonly known as the Mexican juniper, is a species of evergreen conifer native to Mexico. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and produces blue-black berries that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. Its cones are usually female, and the plant is dioecious, meaning male and female reproductive structures are found on separate plants. Juniperus poblana plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
