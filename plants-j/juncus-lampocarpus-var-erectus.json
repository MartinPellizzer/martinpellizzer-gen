    "intro": "Juncus lampocarpus var. erectus, commonly known as the tall rush, is a perennial plant native to coastal areas of California. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and tall, cylindrical flower spikes that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in brackish or saline wetlands, often forming dense stands that stabilize shorelines. Its narrow leaves are typically green to bluish-green, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in spikes. This variety is valued for its ecological role in coastal habitats and its use in wetland restoration projects."
