    "intro": "Juncus serratus, commonly known as the sawleaf rush, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with serrated edges along the leaf margins. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and damp woodlands. Its slender, cylindrical stems are often clustered and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Juncus serratus produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in spike-like clusters, contributing to its ecological role in wetland habitats."
