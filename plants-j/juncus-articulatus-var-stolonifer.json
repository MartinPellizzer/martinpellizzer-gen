    "intro": "Juncus articulatus var. stolonifer, commonly known as the creeping rush, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features tall, cylindrical stems that are typically hollow and covered in fine, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in dense clusters at the top of the stems. It thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. Its stolons allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies that help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife."
