    "intro": "Jaumeopsis mimuloides var. subintegrifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed jaumeopsis, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, yellow-orange flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and have a distinctive subintegrifoliate margin, meaning the leaf edges are almost entirely joined to the midrib. This variant is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential ecological significance."
