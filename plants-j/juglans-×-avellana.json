    "intro": "Juglans \u00d7 avellana, commonly known as the hazelnut hybrid, is a cross between the black walnut (Juglans nigra) and the filbert (Corylus avellana). It is a deciduous tree or shrub that produces edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk. The plant is native to regions where the parent species overlap, primarily in the eastern United States and parts of Europe. Its leaves are alternate, compound, and typically have 5 to 9 leaflets. The flowers are dioecious, with separate male and female plants, and the nuts mature over the course of several months."
