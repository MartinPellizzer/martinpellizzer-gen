    "intro": "Juncoides pumila, commonly known as the dwarf rush, is a small perennial plant belonging to the Juncaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems that grow close to the ground, typically reaching heights of less than 10 centimeters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers in early summer, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Juncoides pumila thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats. Its dense growth habit makes it an effective ground cover in aquatic and semi-aquatic environments."
