    "intro": "Juncus fontanesii subsp. fontanesii, commonly known as the narrowleaf rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 1 mm wide, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of greenish-white flowers. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its tolerance for standing water. This subspecies is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and adaptability."
