    "intro": "Jonthlaspi ciliatum, commonly known as the smooth pavement weed, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features a basal rosette of leaves that are smooth and often covered in a fine, white waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while its stems are slender and branching. Jonthlaspi ciliatum is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and agricultural fields, and is considered a minor weed in some regions."
