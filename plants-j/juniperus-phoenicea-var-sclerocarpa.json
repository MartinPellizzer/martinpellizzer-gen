It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or coastal areas. Its aromatic wood and resilience to drought make it a notable species in Mediterranean ecosystems."
