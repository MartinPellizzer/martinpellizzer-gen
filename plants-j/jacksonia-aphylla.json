    "intro": "Jacksonia aphylla, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its unique, pale yellow or white, bell-shaped flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant has no leaves (hence the species name \"aphylla\"), which is a distinctive botanical feature. It thrives in coastal environments and is often found growing on sandy soils. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unusual appearance."
