    "intro": "Juncus longistylis var. scabratus, commonly known as the rough-styled rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a rough, textured surface, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces tall, cylindrical spikes of small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or brown in color. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in areas with standing water or high groundwater levels. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland habitats and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
