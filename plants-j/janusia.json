    "intro": "Janusia, commonly known as the \"dwarf ironwood,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It consists of only one species, Janusia glabrata, which is native to South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its small, shrub-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in dry, rocky environments. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Janusia is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often used in traditional crafts and as a source of timber."
