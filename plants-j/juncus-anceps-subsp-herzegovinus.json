It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems that grow in dense clusters, often reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of greenish-white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands, streambanks, and forest edges. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
