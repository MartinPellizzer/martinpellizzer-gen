    "intro": "Jurinea longicorollaris, commonly known as the long-corolla jurinea, is a flowering plant native to the cold, arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, commonly known as the carnation family. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white in color. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Jurinea longicorollaris is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
