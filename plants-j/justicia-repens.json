    "intro": "Justicia repens, commonly known as creeping justicia, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, sprawling stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, or white, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly rough texture. Justicia repens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded environments."
