    "intro": "Juniperus baimashanensis, commonly known as the Baimashan juniper, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree that typically grows in mountainous regions with rocky soils. The plant produces small, scale-like leaves and has distinctive blue-green foliage. Its cones are woody and contain aromatic seeds, which are used in traditional medicine. This species is of significant botanical interest due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations to its high-altitude habitat."
