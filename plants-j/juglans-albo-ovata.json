    "intro": "Juglans albo-ovata, commonly known as the white-egg hazelnut, is a species of walnut native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its alternate, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by oval, green husks that encase the edible nuts. Its nuts are typically white or pale yellow when mature and are often harvested in the fall. The tree is valued for its ornamental beauty and its edible seeds, which are used in traditional Chinese cuisine."
