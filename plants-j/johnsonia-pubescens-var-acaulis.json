    "intro": "Johnsonia pubescens var. acaulis, commonly known as the woolly Johnsonia, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly pubescence that covers its stems and leaves, providing insulation against cold temperatures. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its foliage is often a vibrant green, with some varieties displaying a bluish or silvery hue due to the dense covering of hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
