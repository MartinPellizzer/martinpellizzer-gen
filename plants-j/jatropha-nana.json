    "intro": "Jatropha nana, commonly known as the dwarf physic nut, is a small shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It features simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, often with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into orange-red berries containing toxic seeds. Its growth habit is compact, making it suitable for container gardening or as a decorative plant. Despite its ornamental appeal, all parts of the plant contain toxic compounds, requiring caution during handling."
