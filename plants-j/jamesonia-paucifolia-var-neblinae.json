    "intro": "Jamesonia paucifolia var. neblinae, commonly known as the Neblinae Jamesonia, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It features dense, leathery foliage with deep green leaves that have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are fragrant and attract pollinators. It thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and partial shade. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a delicate and endangered species."
