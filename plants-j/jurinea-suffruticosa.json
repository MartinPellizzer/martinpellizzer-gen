    "intro": "Jurinea suffruticosa, commonly known as the sea holly, is a hardy, low-growing plant that thrives in coastal environments. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and showy blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to saline and sandy soils, often found in dunes and rocky shores. Its compact structure and drought tolerance make it well-suited for harsh maritime climates. Jurinea suffruticosa plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting local biodiversity."
