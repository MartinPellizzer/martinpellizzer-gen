It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. This species thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often found in tundra and wetland environments. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it survive in harsh, cold climates. Its structure and growth habits make it an important component of Arctic ecosystems."
