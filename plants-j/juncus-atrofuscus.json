    "intro": "Juncus atrofuscus, commonly known as black rush, is a perennial plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dark green, cylindrical stems that often appear black when dried. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist to saturated soils. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and it reproduces through seeds and rhizomes. Juncus atrofuscus plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
