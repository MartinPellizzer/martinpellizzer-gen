It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces berries that are typically dark blue or black, containing aromatic oils. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils. Juniperus zaidamensis is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its ornamental qualities."
