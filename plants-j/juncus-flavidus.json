    "intro": "Juncus flavidus, commonly known as the yellow rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features tall, cylindrical stems that are typically reddish-brown to yellowish in color, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it an effective pioneer species in disturbed wetlands. Juncus flavidus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
