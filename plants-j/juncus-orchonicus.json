    "intro": "Juncus orchonicus, commonly known as the marsh rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters near the base of the stems, which are pollinated by wind. Its root system helps stabilize soil and improve water filtration in wetland ecosystems. Juncus orchonicus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and environmental benefits."
