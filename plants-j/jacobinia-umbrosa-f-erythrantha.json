    "intro": "Jacobinia umbrosa f. erythrantha, commonly known as the red-flowered Jacobinia, is a rare and striking plant native to the cloud forests of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces clusters of small, red or orange flowers that attract pollinators. It thrives in cool, moist environments with partial shade, making it a sought-after species for specialized horticulture. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered in the wild."
