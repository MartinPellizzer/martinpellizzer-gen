    "intro": "Juncus alpinoarticulatus subsp. alpinoarticulatus, commonly known as the alpine rush, is a perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and slender, cylindrical stems that often form clumps. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, temperate climates. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in spike-like clusters at the ends of the stems. This subspecies is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient component of alpine ecosystems."
