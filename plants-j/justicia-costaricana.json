    "intro": "Justicia costaricana, commonly known as the flame flower or red flame plant, is a tropical perennial shrub native to Central America. It is characterized by its striking, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes in tropical and subtropical regions."
