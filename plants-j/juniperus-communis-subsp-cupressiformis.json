    "intro": "Juniperus communis subsp. cupressiformis, commonly known as the creeping juniper, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features dense, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces small, blue or black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit, making it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover. It is adapted to harsh environments, including rocky soils and coastal areas, and is often used in horticulture for its hardiness and ornamental value."
