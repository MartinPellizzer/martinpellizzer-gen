    "intro": "Juglans \u00d7 intermedia var. vilmoreana, commonly known as the hybrid walnut, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between black walnut (Juglans nigra) and English walnut (Juglans regia). It is characterized by its medium-sized, oblong nuts with a thick, smooth husk that splits open to reveal the edible kernel. The plant typically grows as a deciduous tree with compound leaves that are alternate and pinnately arranged. It thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained, fertile soils. This variety is valued for its nut production and is often cultivated for both ornamental and agricultural purposes."
