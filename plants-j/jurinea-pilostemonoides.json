    "intro": "Jurinea pilostemonoides, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to high sunlight exposure. Due to its resilience, it is often used in xeriscaping and as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
