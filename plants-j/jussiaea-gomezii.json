    "intro": "Jussiaea gomezii, commonly known as the Mexican water primrose, is a flowering plant native to parts of Mexico and Central America. It is a member of the Onagraceae family and typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes and ponds. The plant has slender, branching stems and produces small, showy flowers that are usually pink or white. Its leaves are opposite and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its aquatic habitat. Jussiaea gomezii is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in waterlogged soils."
