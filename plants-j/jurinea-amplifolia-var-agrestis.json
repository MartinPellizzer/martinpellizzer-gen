    "intro": "Jurinea amplifolia var. agrestis, commonly known as the coastal sandplant, is a perennial herb native to sandy coastal areas of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize sand dunes, making it an important species for coastal erosion control. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in maritime climates with strong sea breezes."
