    "intro": "Jurinea cypria, commonly known as the Cyprus sandflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing annual plant with slender, hairy stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry habitats. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Jurinea cypria is adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native environment."
