    "intro": "Justicia caudata, commonly known as the whorled flame flower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are usually red or orange, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. These flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, especially hummingbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates."
