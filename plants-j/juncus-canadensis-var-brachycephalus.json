    "intro": "Juncus canadensis var. brachycephalus, commonly known as the short-headed rush, is a variant of the common rush found in wetland environments. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of small, spike-like flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often crowded at the base, forming a compact rosette. It thrives in moist to aquatic habitats, including marshes, swamps, and the edges of ponds. This variety is notable for its compact growth habit and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
