    "intro": "Jacobaeastrum lateriflorum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ragwort, is a flowering plant native to western North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, and it produces small yellow flowers in the summer. It is considered a potential weed in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed soils."
