    "intro": "Justicia lancifolia, commonly known as the swordleaf false arum, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and striking, spathaceous inflorescences that resemble those of arum plants. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers arranged in a dense cluster, often surrounded by a leaf-like bract. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its unique foliage and floral display."
