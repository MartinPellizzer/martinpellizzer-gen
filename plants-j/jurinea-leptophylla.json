    "intro": "Jurinea leptophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sea bladder, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its small, pale yellow flowers and narrow, succulent leaves adapted to saline environments. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shores and is often found in maritime climates. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, which is well-suited to its coastal habitat. Jurinea leptophylla plays a role in stabilizing dune systems and supporting local biodiversity."
