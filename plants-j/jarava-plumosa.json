    "intro": "Jarava plumosa, commonly known as the silky jarava, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and fine, silky hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and open grasslands. Due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil, it plays an important ecological role in its native habitats."
