It belongs to the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer. The tree has a straight trunk with smooth, grey bark and lance-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its fluffy, pod-like fruit that splits open to release seeds.
