    "intro": "Juniperus communis var. alpina, commonly known as the Alpine juniper, is a shrub-like evergreen conifer native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often forming dense thickets. The plant has needle-like leaves that are blue-green in color and produce small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. It is well adapted to cold climates and can withstand harsh winter conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
