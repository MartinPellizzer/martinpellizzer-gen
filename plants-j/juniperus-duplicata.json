    "intro": "Juniperus duplicata, commonly known as the double juniper, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and scaly, dark blue-green foliage. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are typically dark blue when mature, containing toxic seeds. Juniperus duplicata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally used in horticulture for its hardy nature and aesthetic qualities."
