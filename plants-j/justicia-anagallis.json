    "intro": "Justicia anagallis, commonly known as the velvetleaf or redroot, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from red to purple. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in a fine, velvety texture, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. The plant is known for its ability to spread rapidly through rhizomes, making it both a valuable ornamental and a potential weed in certain environments."
