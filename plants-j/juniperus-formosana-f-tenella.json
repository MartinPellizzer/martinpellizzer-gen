    "intro": "Juniperus formosana f. tenella, commonly known as the compact juniper, is a compact, shrub-like form of the Taiwanese juniper. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are often used in traditional medicine and as a spice. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and as a foundation plant in landscaping. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and hardiness in temperate climates."
