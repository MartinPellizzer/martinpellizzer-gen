    "intro": "Jasione foliosa subsp. xauenensis, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Spain and southern France. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and branched. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations to its alpine habitat."
