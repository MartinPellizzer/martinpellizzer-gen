    "intro": "Juncus persicus subsp. libanoticus, commonly known as the Lebanon rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks, marshes, and wetlands. The plant has cylindrical, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in semi-aquatic environments and its tolerance to both wet and dry conditions. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a potential candidate for ecological restoration projects."
