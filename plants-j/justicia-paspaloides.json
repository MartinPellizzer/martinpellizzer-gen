    "intro": "Justicia paspaloides, commonly known as carpet grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southern United States and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale blue, often with red or purple markings. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along waterways. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic weed in many regions."
