    "intro": "Jonesia macroptera, commonly known as the giant fern, is a striking tropical plant characterized by its large, feather-like fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to the humid regions of Southeast Asia. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with long, pinnately divided leaves that can reach several meters in length. Its fronds are typically dark green and glossy, with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture in its native environment. Jonesia macroptera is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to shaded, moist garden settings."
