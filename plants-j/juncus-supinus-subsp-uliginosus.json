    "intro": "Juncus supinus subsp. uliginosus, commonly known as the bog rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in dense clusters, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with cylindrical, grass-like leaves that are often reddish or purplish in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in early summer, arranged in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist to waterlogged soils, making it a common species in peat bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive colonies in suitable habitats."
