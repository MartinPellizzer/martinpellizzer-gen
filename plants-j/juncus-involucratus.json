    "intro": "Juncus involucratus, commonly known as the narrowleaf rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers during the summer months. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic habitats. Juncus involucratus is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
