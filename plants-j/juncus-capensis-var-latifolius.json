    "intro": "Juncus capensis var. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and wetlands. The plant features slender, grass-like stems that are often clustered and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are broad, flat, and often have a slight sheen, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The small, clustered flowers are usually greenish or brownish and appear at the tips of the stems, typical of the Juncaceae family."
