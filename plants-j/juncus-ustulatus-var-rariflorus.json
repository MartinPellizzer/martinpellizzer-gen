    "intro": "Juncus ustulatus var. rariflorus, commonly known as the sparse-flower rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It belongs to the Juncaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, cylindrical leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers arranged in dense spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
