It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant features broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in buoyancy and water retention. Its small, yellowish flowers are borne on slender stalks and bloom in early summer. This species plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
