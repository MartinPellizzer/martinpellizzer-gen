It features slender, grass-like stems that are often reddish or purplish in color, growing in dense clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, typically arranged in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its morphology is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds typical of its high-altitude habitat."
