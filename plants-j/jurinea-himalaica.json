    "intro": "Jurinea himalaica, commonly known as the Himalayan sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in arid and rocky environments, often found in alpine meadows and mountainous areas. Its adaptations include a compact growth form and thick leaves that help conserve water. Jurinea himalaica plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is of interest to botanists studying plant resilience in extreme climates."
