    "intro": "Juncus \u00d7 obotritorum, commonly known as the hybrid rush, is a perennial plant belonging to the Juncaceae family. It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Juncus effusus and Juncus roemerianus, two native North American rush species. The plant typically grows in brackish or saltwater environments, such as tidal marshes and estuaries, where it forms dense, grass-like clumps. Its cylindrical, grass-like leaves are usually green to bluish-green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. Juncus \u00d7 obotritorum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
