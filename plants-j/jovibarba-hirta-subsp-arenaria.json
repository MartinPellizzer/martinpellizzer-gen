    "intro": "Jovibarba hirta subsp. arenaria, commonly known as the desert hawksbeard, is a perennial succulent native to arid regions of southern Europe and North Africa. It features fleshy, gray-green leaves with a dense covering of fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow composite flowers in summer, which are arranged in a flattened, disk-like structure. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens. Its unique appearance and resilience make it a notable species in xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
