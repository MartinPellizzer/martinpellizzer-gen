    "intro": "Juncus articulatus var. aquaticus, commonly known as the aquatic rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clusters of grass-like foliage. The plant has jointed stems that are often green or reddish in color, and its leaves are narrow and strap-shaped. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes during the summer months. This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
