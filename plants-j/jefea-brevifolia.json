    "intro": "Jefea brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved jefea, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, capsule-like fruits. Native to specific regions in South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments within tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Jefea brevifolia is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
