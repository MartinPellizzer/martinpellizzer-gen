    "intro": "Juncus bufonius f. frondescens, commonly known as the frog's-bit sedge, is a flowering plant species native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and cylindrical, typically ranging from 10 to 30 centimeters in length. The species is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
