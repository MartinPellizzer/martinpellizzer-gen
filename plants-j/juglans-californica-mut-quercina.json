    "intro": "Juglans californica mut. quercina, commonly known as the California black walnut, is a variant of the black walnut tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dark, ridged bark and large, compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces edible, greenish-yellow fruits encased in a spiky husk, which mature in late summer. Its seeds are enclosed in a hard, woody shell and require cold stratification to germinate. This species is valued for its timber and has ecological significance in supporting local wildlife."
