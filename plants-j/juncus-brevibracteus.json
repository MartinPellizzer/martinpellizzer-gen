    "intro": "Juncus brevibracteus, commonly known as the short-bract rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are usually less than 1 meter in height, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spike-like clusters and are typically wind-pollinated. Juncus brevibracteus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
