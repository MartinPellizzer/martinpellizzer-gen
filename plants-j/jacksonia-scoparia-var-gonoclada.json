It belongs to the daisy family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal and sandy soils, thriving in well-drained environments. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into fluffy seed heads, aiding in its dispersal. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to other varieties of Jacksonia."
