    "intro": "Juncus tenax var. glaucus, commonly known as the blue rush, is a variant of the common rush that exhibits distinctive botanical features. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves that are typically a bluish-green color, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its flowering stems are usually shorter than the leafy basal rosette, and the flowers are small, clustered in spikelets. This variant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize wetland soils."
