It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves. Its flowers are usually borne in axillary clusters and emit a sweet, intoxicating scent. Jasminum multipartitum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in perfumery due to its aromatic properties."
