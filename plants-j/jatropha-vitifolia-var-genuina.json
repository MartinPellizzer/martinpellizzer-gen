    "intro": "Jatropha vitifolia var. genuina, commonly known as the grapeleaf jatropha, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in a pinnate pattern and have a distinctive grape-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to orange-red berries containing toxic seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and potential for medicinal use, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and research settings."
