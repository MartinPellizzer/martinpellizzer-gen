    "intro": "Juniperus tibetica, commonly known as Tibetan juniper, is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its scale-like leaves and small, berry-like cones that mature to a dark blue color. The plant is well adapted to cold and arid conditions, often growing in rocky or mountainous terrain. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species. Juniperus tibetica is also valued for its aromatic wood and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
