    "intro": "Juglans oliviformis, commonly known as the olive-shaped walnut, is a species of deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its oval, dark green leaves and distinctive, olive-shaped nuts enclosed in a thick, woody husk. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by the development of its unique fruit. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with shallow furrows that become more pronounced as the tree matures. Juglans oliviformis is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
