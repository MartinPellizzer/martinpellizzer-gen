    "intro": "Jamesonia aureonitens, commonly known as the golden-veined saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, glossy green leaves with prominent golden veins. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
