It is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems that can grow up to 6 feet in height. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in spikes during the summer months. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its dense growth helps prevent erosion and provides habitat for various wildlife species."
