    "intro": "Juncus petrophilus, commonly known as the rock rush, is a perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and its ability to thrive in well-drained, often nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil in harsh conditions. Juncus petrophilus is often found in mountainous regions and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds."
