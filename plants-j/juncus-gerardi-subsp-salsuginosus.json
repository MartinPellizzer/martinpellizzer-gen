It typically grows in wet, saline soils and is often found in marshes, tidal flats, and saltwater swamps. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color and bear small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is adapted to withstand high salinity and fluctuating water levels. This subspecies plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
