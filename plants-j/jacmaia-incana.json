It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and small, gray-green leaves covered in a fine, fuzzy layer. The plant produces clusters of pale blue or violet flowers during the summer months. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water. Jacmaia incana is often found in rocky soils and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
