    "intro": "Juncus effusus subsp. austrocalifornicus, commonly known as the coastal rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and cylindrical, spike-like inflorescence. This subspecies typically grows in moist, saline environments such as tidal marshes and coastal dunes. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in these dynamic habitats. The plant plays a vital role in supporting local biodiversity by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
