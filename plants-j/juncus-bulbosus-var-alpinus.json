It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear greenish-yellow flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra environments. It is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate frost and low light conditions. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
