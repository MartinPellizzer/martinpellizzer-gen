    "intro": "Juncus tenax, commonly known as hard rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are arranged in spikes, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Juncus tenax thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
