    "intro": "Juncus albidus, commonly known as the white rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikes of white or pale green flowers. The plant is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and streams. Its hollow, cylindrical stems are composed of a single layer of cells, a characteristic feature of the Juncaceae family. Juncus albidus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
