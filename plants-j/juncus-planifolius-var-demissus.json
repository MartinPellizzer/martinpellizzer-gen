It features slender, grass-like stems that grow in dense clusters, often reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters at the tips of the stems, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are flat and linear, contributing to its distinctive appearance.
