    "intro": "Jasminum zenkeri, commonly known as the African jasmine, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a deciduous shrub that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its fragrant white flowers and glossy dark green leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its roots are fibrous and capable of forming a dense network, which helps stabilize soil in its natural habitat. Jasminum zenkeri is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
