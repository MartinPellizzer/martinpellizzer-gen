    "intro": "Jasminum superfluum, commonly known as the Chinese jasmine, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. The plant typically grows as a shrub or vine, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate with a glossy surface. The botanical name reflects its status as a species that is somewhat less common or less distinct compared to other jasmine species."
