    "intro": "Juncus trinervis var. minor, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in marshy areas, stream banks, and other moist habitats, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant features slender, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color and bear small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slight curvature, and it produces spike-like inflorescences. This variety is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
