    "intro": "Juncus compressus f. alpinus, commonly known as the alpine rush, is a compact, herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, rocky or sandy soils at high elevations. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often blue-green in color, and it produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brownish flowers. It is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate harsh environmental conditions. This form is considered a subspecies or form of the broader Juncus compressus species, showing distinct morphological traits suited to its alpine habitat."
