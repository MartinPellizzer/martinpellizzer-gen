    "intro": "Juncus membranaceus, commonly known as paper rush, is a perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features tall, slender, grass-like stems that are often used in floral arrangements due to their delicate appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and they are often covered with a fine, silky coating. Paper rush is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wetland organisms."
