    "intro": "Juniperus myurus, commonly known as the creeping juniper, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It has a compact, mat-like growth habit with scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and whitish underneath. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It is well adapted to harsh, arid environments and can thrive in poor soil conditions. Juniperus myurus is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value."
