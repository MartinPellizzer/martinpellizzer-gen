    "intro": "Juncus inaequalis var. altus, commonly known as the tall rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It features tall, slender cylindrical stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, often forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of greenish-white flowers at the top of the stems, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. This variety is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wetland organisms."
