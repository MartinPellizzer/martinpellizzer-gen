    "intro": "Jurinea foliosa, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray, woolly leaves and showy blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in salty, sandy soils and is often found in maritime environments. Its adaptations include a compact growth form and specialized root systems that help it withstand harsh coastal conditions. Jurinea foliosa plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small coastal organisms."
