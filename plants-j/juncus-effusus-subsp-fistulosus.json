    "intro": "Juncus effusus subsp. fistulosus, commonly known as the hollow rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It is characterized by its cylindrical, hollow stems that are often used in basket-making due to their flexibility and durability. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland habitats and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
