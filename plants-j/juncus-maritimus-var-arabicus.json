    "intro": "Juncus maritimus var. arabicus, commonly known as the Arabian rush, is a flowering plant native to coastal and saline environments in the Middle East and North Africa. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, clustered spikes of greenish or brownish flowers. The plant thrives in brackish or saltwater conditions, making it well adapted to coastal dunes and marshes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize sandy soils. The leaves are narrow and cylindrical, often covered with a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in arid conditions."
