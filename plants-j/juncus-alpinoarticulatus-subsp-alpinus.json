It features slender, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in fine, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in alpine meadows and tundra environments. Its ability to withstand cold temperatures makes it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
