It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of yellow or orange flowers. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are small and often covered in a sticky substance.
