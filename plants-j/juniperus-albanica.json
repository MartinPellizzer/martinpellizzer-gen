    "intro": "Juniperus albanica, commonly known as the Albanian juniper, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the Balkan Peninsula. It typically grows in mountainous regions and is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. Its foliage consists of scale-like leaves that are dense and provide good cover. Juniperus albanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
