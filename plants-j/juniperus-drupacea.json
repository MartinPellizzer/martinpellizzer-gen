    "intro": "Juniperus drupacea, commonly known as the dwarf juniper, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 feet, featuring dense, needle-like leaves that are dark green and often retain their color year-round. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant due to its hardy nature. Juniperus drupacea is also valued for its aromatic foliage and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
