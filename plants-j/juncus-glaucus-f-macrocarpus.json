    "intro": "Juncus glaucus f. macrocarpus, commonly known as the broad-fruited rush, is a variant of the common rush species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that often grow in dense clumps, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its botanical features make it well adapted to wet or moist environments, such as marshes and stream sides. This form is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various organisms."
