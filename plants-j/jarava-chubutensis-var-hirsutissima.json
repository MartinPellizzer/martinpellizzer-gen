    "intro": "Jarava chubutensis var. hirsutissima, commonly known as the Hirsute Jarava, is a perennial grass native to the Patagonian region of Argentina. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils and in open grasslands. This variant is distinguished by its particularly hairy foliage, which gives it its common name."
