It is a herbaceous perennial that produces vibrant, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in dense clusters. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its showy blooms and adaptability, it is a popular choice for gardens and landscapes in tropical and subtropical regions."
