    "intro": "Juniperus chinensis f. procumbens-aurea, commonly known as the golden creeping juniper, is a low-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. Its foliage consists of scale-like leaves that are bright golden yellow, providing a striking visual contrast to the dark green of the central stems. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are typically borne on the tips of the branches. It is well-suited for rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various environmental conditions."
