It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and marshy areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers. It is often found in disturbed or nutrient-rich soils, contributing to soil stabilization. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
