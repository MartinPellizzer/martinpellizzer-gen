    "intro": "Juniperus coahuilensis, commonly known as Coahuila juniper, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Chihuahuan Desert in northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves and small, blue-black berries that are typically used for making juniper berries. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soils and extreme temperatures. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
