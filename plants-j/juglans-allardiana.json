    "intro": "Juglans allardiana, commonly known as the Allard hickory, is a species of deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 10 to 20 inches long and composed of 15 to 23 leaflets. The tree produces edible nuts enclosed in a thick, spiny husk, similar to other hickory species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky areas. The Allard hickory is valued for its hard, durable wood and is also an important species for wildlife habitat."
