    "intro": "Jaltomata bernardelloana, commonly known as the Bernardello's jaltomata, is a flowering plant species native to the Andes mountains of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually ovate or elliptical, with a rough texture, and it produces berries that contain the seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
