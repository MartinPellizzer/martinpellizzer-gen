    "intro": "Jurinea eximia, commonly known as the coastal bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid and coastal regions of western North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions such as salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Jurinea eximia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various insect species."
