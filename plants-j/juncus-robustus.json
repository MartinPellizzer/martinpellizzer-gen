    "intro": "Juncus robustus, commonly known as the tall rush, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves and tall, cylindrical flower spikes. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. Its flowering occurs in late summer to early autumn, producing small, inconspicuous flowers that are often wind-pollinated. Juncus robustus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
