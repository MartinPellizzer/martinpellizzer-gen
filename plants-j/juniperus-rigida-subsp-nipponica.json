    "intro": "Juniperus rigida subsp. nipponica, commonly known as Japanese juniper, is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to Japan. It belongs to the Cupressaceae family and is characterized by its scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, compact growth. This subspecies is also valued in traditional Japanese landscapes for its resilience and aesthetic appeal."
