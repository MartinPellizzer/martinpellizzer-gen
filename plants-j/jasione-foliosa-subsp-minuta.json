    "intro": "Jasione foliosa subsp. minuta, commonly known as the small-leaved jasmine weed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length, arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces delicate, yellowish-white flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as rocky soils and disturbed areas. Its botanical structure makes it well-adapted to Mediterranean climates with mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers."
