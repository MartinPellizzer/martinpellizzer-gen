    "intro": "Jurinea depressa var. pinnatisecta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are deeply divided into narrow segments, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. Its succulent leaves help it store water, making it well-suited for drought conditions."
