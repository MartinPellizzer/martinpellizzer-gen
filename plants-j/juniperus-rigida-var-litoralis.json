    "intro": "Juniperus rigida var. litoralis, commonly known as the coastal juniper, is a variant of the juniper shrub adapted to coastal environments. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, scale-like leaves that provide wind resistance. The plant produces blue-gray berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found along shorelines. Its hardy nature makes it a valuable plant for coastal stabilization and ecological restoration."
