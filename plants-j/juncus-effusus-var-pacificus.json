    "intro": "Juncus effusus var. pacificus, commonly known as the Pacific rush, is a perennial plant native to coastal regions of the western United States and Canada. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that often grow in dense clusters, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, greenish-white flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, tidal zones, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in coastal and riparian environments."
