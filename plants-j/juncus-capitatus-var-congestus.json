    "intro": "Juncus capitatus var. congestus, commonly known as the clustered rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It forms dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces small, cylindrical flower spikes that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize moist soils effectively. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wetland organisms."
