    "intro": "Juniperus canescens, commonly known as the silver juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are typically blue or purple in color. It thrives in arid and rocky environments, making it well adapted to harsh, dry conditions. Juniperus canescens is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
