    "intro": "Juncus alpinus f. obtusatus, commonly known as the blunt-leaved alpine rush, is a compact, herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves that are shorter and more rounded at the tips compared to the typical form. The plant produces small, greenish-brown spikelets that are often hidden among the foliage, contributing to its subtle appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, cold climates. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens and as a hardy, low-maintenance plant for alpine collections."
