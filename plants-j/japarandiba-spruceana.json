    "intro": "Japarandiba spruceana, commonly known as the Brazilian spruce, is a coniferous tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure typical of the Pinaceae family. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 20 meters in its natural habitat. It thrives in humid, temperate climates and is often found in well-drained soils. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
