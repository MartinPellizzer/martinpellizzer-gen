It is characterized by its large, showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with contrasting yellow or white markings. The plant is a shrub or small tree, capable of reaching heights of up to 10 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. Its flowers are typically arranged in terminal clusters and are adapted for pollination by birds, particularly hummingbirds. Justicia grandis thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in warm climates."
