    "intro": "Jurinea ludmilae, commonly known as the Ludmila's sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its unique, spiny leaves and small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. It plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
