    "intro": "Jatropha villosa, commonly known as the hairy physic nut, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into capsule fruits containing toxic seeds. Jatropha villosa is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in dry, arid environments. It is sometimes cultivated for its potential in biofuel production due to its oil-rich seeds."
