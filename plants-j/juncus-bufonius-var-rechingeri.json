    "intro": "Juncus bufonius var. rechingeri, commonly known as the water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features tall, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color and produce small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to thrive in moist or waterlogged soils. It is often found in marshes, ditches, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. Its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
