    "intro": "Juniperus recurva var. typica, commonly known as the creeping juniper, is a shrub-like evergreen conifer native to the western United States. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid climates. The plant has a low, mat-forming growth habit with needle-like leaves that are blue-green in color. Its small, berry-like cones are usually dark blue and contain toxic compounds. It is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and drought tolerance."
