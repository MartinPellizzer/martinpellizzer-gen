    "intro": "Jonghea, commonly known as the \"Bornean hibiscus,\" is a genus of flowering plants native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo. These plants are shrubs or small trees with showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The leaves are usually large, heart-shaped, and have a waxy surface, while the stems are often covered in fine hairs. Jonghea species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens. They play an important ecological role in their native habitats by providing food and shelter for various wildlife."
