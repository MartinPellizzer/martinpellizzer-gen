    "intro": "Jasminonerium grandiflorum, commonly known as the giant jasmine, is a striking plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its large, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often reaching up to 10 centimeters in diameter. The plant features broad, waxy leaves that are dark green and glossy, providing a lush backdrop for its showy blooms. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Jasminonerium grandiflorum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is prized in gardens for its dramatic floral display."
