    "intro": "Jatropha froesii, commonly known as the Froes's physic nut, is a species of flowering plant in the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces small, greenish-brown berries that contain toxic seeds, which are not suitable for human consumption. It is often cultivated for its potential in biofuel production due to the high oil content in its seeds. However, it is important to handle the plant with care due to its toxic properties."
