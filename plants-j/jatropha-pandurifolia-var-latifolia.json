    "intro": "Jatropha pandurifolia var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf jatropha, is a species of flowering plant in the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain toxic seeds, which are not suitable for human consumption. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in disturbed areas and along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though care must be taken due to its toxic properties."
