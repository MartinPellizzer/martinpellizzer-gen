    "intro": "Juglans \u00d7 intermedia var. pyriformis, commonly known as the pear-shaped hickory, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Juglans mandshurica and Juglans regia. It is characterized by its distinctive pear-shaped nuts, which are typically larger and more elongated than those of its parent species. The plant is native to regions of eastern Asia, including parts of China and the Russian Far East. Its leaves are alternate, compound, and have a serrated margin, while the bark is rugged and grayish in color. This variety is valued for its edible nuts and is often cultivated for both ornamental and agricultural purposes."
