    "intro": "Jurinea kuraminensis, commonly known as the Kuraminense sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines, demonstrating adaptability to harsh coastal conditions. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
