    "intro": "Justicia ptychostoma, commonly known as the purple flame or red flame plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to purple. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to 3 feet, with lance-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, especially hummingbirds, due to their bright colors and nectar-rich structure.
