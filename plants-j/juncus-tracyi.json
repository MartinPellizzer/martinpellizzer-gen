    "intro": "Juncus tracyi, commonly known as Tracy's rush, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Juncaceae and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and cylindrical flower clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along streambanks and wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, which can stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Tracy's rush is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in wetland habitats."
