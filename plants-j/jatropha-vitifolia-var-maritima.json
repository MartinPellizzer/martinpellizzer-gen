    "intro": "Jatropha vitifolia var. maritima, commonly known as sea jatropha, is a coastal plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into capsule fruits containing toxic, orange-red seeds. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in coastal dunes and shorelines. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects along coastlines."
