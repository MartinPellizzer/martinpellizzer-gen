    "intro": "Jurinea trautvetteriana, commonly known as the Trautvetter's sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes and salt marshes. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers arranged in a dense, spiky cluster, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Jurinea trautvetteriana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
