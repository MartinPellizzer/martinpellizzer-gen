    "intro": "Jumellea lignosa subsp. lignosa, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and woody, aromatic leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by bright red berries that attract birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, rocky habitats. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
