    "intro": "Jussiaea aluligera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water-mint, is a semi-aquatic plant native to wetland environments in South America. It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic conditions. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize moist soils effectively. Jussiaea aluligera is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems."
