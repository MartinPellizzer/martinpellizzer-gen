    "intro": "Juncus mairei, commonly known as Maire's rush, is a perennial plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Juncaceae and is characterized by its grass-like foliage and cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or damp environments such as marshes, stream banks, and forest floors. Its slender, hollow stems are often used in traditional M\u0101ori basketry and weaving. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, with three stamens and a single pistil, typical of the Juncaceae family."
