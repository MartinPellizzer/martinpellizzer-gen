    "intro": "Juncus oligocephalus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America. It features tall, cylindrical stems that are often reddish or purplish in color, growing up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of greenish-white flowers at the top of the stems, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Juncus oligocephalus plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
