    "intro": "Jatropha chamelensis, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often hairy and have a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its latex sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, making it important to handle with care. Jatropha chamelensis is also noted for its ability to thrive in poor soils and arid conditions, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
