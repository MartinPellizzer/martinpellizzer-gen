    "intro": "Jambosa phacelantha, commonly known as the dwarf Natal plum, is a small, evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a slight pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in spring, which are followed by edible, sweet, yellow fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a container plant."
