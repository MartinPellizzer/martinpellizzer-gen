    "intro": "Juncus ponticus, commonly known as the Pontic rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like flower clusters that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic environments. Juncus ponticus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in fluctuating water conditions."
