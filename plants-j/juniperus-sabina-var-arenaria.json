    "intro": "Juniperus sabina var. arenaria, commonly known as sand juniper, is a shrub-like evergreen conifer native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and produces blue-black berries that are typically consumed by birds and small mammals. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements. The wood of sand juniper is lightweight and has been historically used for fence posts and other utilitarian purposes."
