    "intro": "Juncus alpinus var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine rush, is a perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green or brown in color. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra environments. Juncus alpinus var. alpestris plays a role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude ecosystems and provides habitat for various small invertebrates."
