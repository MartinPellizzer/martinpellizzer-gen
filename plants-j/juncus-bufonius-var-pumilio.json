    "intro": "Juncus bufonius var. pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, swales, and pond edges. The plant features slender, grass-like stems that are often reddish in color, and it produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slight sheen, and it is adapted to tolerate fluctuating water levels. This variety is smaller than the typical Juncus bufonius, with a more compact growth habit."
