    "intro": "Jaltomata quipuscoae, commonly known as the Quipuscoa bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and is adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are generally ovate with a slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that contain the seeds. Jaltomata quipuscoae is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological significance in its native environment."
