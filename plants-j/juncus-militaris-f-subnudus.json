It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments, typically found in marshes and along the edges of water bodies. The plant features slender, grass-like stems that are usually smooth and hairless, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and cylindrical, often occurring in dense clusters at the base. The inflorescence consists of small, three-sided spikes that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, typical of the Juncaceae family."
