    "intro": "Jatropha angustifolia var. genuina, commonly known as the narrow-leaf jatropha, is a perennial shrub native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It features lanceolate leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into capsule fruits containing toxic, orange-red seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species with drought tolerance. However, its latex contains toxic compounds, which can be harmful to humans and animals if ingested."
