It is characterized by its large, lobed leaves and distinctive, edible nuts encased in a thick, green husk. The tree produces a hard, dark wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and requires a cold winter for proper fruit development. This subspecies is often cultivated for its nuts and timber, contributing to both local economies and ecological landscapes."
