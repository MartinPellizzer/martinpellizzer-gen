    "intro": "Jacobaeastrum arabicum, commonly known as the Arabian groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Jacobaeastrum arabicum is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or limestone areas."
