    "intro": "Juniperus barbadensis subsp. lucayana, commonly known as the Lucayan juniper, is a subspecies native to the Caribbean islands, particularly the Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands. It is a small evergreen shrub or tree that typically grows in coastal dunes and limestone soils. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain the aromatic, resinous seeds used in various traditional and commercial applications. Its foliage consists of scale-like leaves that are densely packed and emit a distinctive pine-like scent. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal environments and its historical use in local crafts and medicine."
