It is a slow-growing, evergreen conifer with a narrow, pyramid-shaped crown. The plant features scale-like leaves that are dark green and closely pressed to the branches. Its small, blue-black berries are produced in cone-like structures and are an important food source for wildlife. This subspecies is typically found in dry, sandy soils in the southeastern United States."
