It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces blue or purple berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and mountainous regions. Juniperus turkestanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in landscaping in regions with suitable climates."
