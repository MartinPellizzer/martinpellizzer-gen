    "intro": "Jurinea moschata, commonly known as the musk gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes. Its flowers are tubular and often have a distinctive musky scent, which is likely an adaptation to attract specific pollinators. Jurinea moschata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
