    "intro": "Jatropha villosa var. pelargoniifolia, commonly known as the red-leaf jatropha, is a variant of the jatropha genus native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, velvety, and often brightly colored foliage, which can range from red to purple. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that eventually develop into spiny, capsule-like fruits containing toxic seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated for its unique leaf coloration."
