    "intro": "Juniperus thunbergii, commonly known as Japanese red cedar, is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces blue or purple berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Juniperus thunbergii is also valued for its durable wood, which has been historically used in construction and furniture-making."
