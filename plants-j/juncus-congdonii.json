    "intro": "Juncus congdonii, commonly known as the Congdon's rush, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and tall, cylindrical flower spikes that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil. Juncus congdonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting wetland biodiversity."
