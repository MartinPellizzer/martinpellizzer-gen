    "intro": "Jacksonia hemisericea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features bright yellow ray flowers surrounded by a disk of smaller florets, typical of the genus Jacksonia. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Jacksonia hemisericea is often found in open, sunny areas such as grasslands and forest margins."
