This plant features a dense, spherical cluster of flowers at the top of its slender, grass-like stems. It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, preferring moist soils and full sun to partial shade. The leaves are linear and grass-like, often standing upright, while the flower heads are arranged in an umbrella-like shape. It is a perennial plant that plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
