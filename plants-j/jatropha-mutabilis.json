    "intro": "Jatropha mutabilis, commonly known as the variable euphorbia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin, a common trait among plants in the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are typically alternate and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Jatropha mutabilis is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid environments."
