    "intro": "Juncus articulatus var. pelocarpus, commonly known as the southern jointed rush, is a perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems that are often jointed and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture that contributes to its structural strength. This variety is often found in wetland habitats, including marshes and along the edges of ponds and streams."
