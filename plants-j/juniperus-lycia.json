    "intro": "Juniperus lycia, commonly known as the Cyprus juniper, is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves and small, blue-gray berries that are often used in herbal medicine. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is well adapted to coastal and arid environments. It has a slow growth rate and can live for several decades, making it a long-lived species in its native habitat. The foliage and berries of Juniperus lycia are often used in traditional remedies and as a source of essential oils."
