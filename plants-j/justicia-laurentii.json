    "intro": "Justicia laurentii, commonly known as red hot poker, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking spikes of bright red bracts that resemble poker chips, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in clusters at the base of the bracts, typically in shades of yellow or orange. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from summer into fall."
