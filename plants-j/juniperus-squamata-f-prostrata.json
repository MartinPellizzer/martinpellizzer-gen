    "intro": "Juniperus squamata f. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate juniper, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, providing a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are often used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its prostrate growth habit makes it suitable for use as a ground cover in landscaping."
