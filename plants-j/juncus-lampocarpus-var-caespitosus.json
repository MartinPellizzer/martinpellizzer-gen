    "intro": "Juncus lampocarpus var. caespitosus, commonly known as the coastal rush, is a perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and slender, cylindrical stems that grow close to the ground. The plant typically thrives in moist, sandy soils along coastal dunes and tidal flats. Its leaves are narrow and wiry, often forming tight clusters that help stabilize the shoreline. This variety is well adapted to salt spray and wind, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
