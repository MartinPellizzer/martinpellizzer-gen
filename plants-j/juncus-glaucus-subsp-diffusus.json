    "intro": "Juncus glaucus subsp. diffusus, commonly known as the silver rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It features slender, grass-like stems that are often covered in a waxy, bluish-gray coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers arranged in dense spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions."
