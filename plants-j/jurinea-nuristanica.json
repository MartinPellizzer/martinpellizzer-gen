    "intro": "Jurinea nuristanica, commonly known as the Nuristan sandflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of northern Pakistan and Afghanistan. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its yellowish flowers bloom in the summer months, and it is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
