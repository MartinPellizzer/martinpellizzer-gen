    "intro": "Jarava annua, commonly known as annual jarava, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and typically grows in dry, open habitats such as sandy soils and grasslands. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture that helps it withstand arid conditions. Jarava annua is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
