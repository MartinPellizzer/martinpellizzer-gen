    "intro": "Jacobaea divaricata, commonly known as the common tansy, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. It contains toxic compounds, including pyrethrin, which has been historically used in insecticides. However, due to its toxicity, it is not recommended for use in gardens or around livestock."
