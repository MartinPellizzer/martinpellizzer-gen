    "intro": "Juncus coriaceus, commonly known as tough rush, is a perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features cylindrical, grass-like leaves that are densely packed and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in saturated soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization and erosion control in wetland ecosystems. Juncus coriaceus is also valued for its ability to filter water and support diverse wildlife habitats."
