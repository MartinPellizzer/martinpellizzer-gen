    "intro": "Jovibarba hirta subsp. allionii, commonly known as the Alpine stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and rosettes of thick, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
