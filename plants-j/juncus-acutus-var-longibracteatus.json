    "intro": "Juncus acutus var. longibracteatus, commonly known as the long-bract rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its grass-like, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color and covered with soft, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its roots form dense mats that help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. This variety is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and lakes."
