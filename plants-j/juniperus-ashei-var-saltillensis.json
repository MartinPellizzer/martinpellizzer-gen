    "intro": "Juniperus ashei var. saltillensis, commonly known as the Mexican juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the Chihuahuan Desert region of Mexico. It is characterized by its scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, providing a striking visual contrast against the arid landscape. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils. It is well adapted to harsh, dry environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and resistance to extreme temperatures. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes and natural habitats."
