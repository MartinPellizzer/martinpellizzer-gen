    "intro": "Jurinea asperifolia, commonly known as the roughleaf sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its silver-gray, hairy leaves and striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to saline and windy environments. Its structure includes a low-growing, mat-forming habit with branching stems. Jurinea asperifolia is often found in dunes and coastal plains, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes."
