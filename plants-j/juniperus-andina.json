It is characterized by its needle-like leaves and small, blue-gray berries that are typically used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in arid and cold environments, often growing at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its wood is durable and has been historically used for construction and fuel. Juniperus andina plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species in its native range."
