    "intro": "Juniperus himalayaensis, commonly known as the Himalayan juniper, is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of the Himalayas. It typically grows at high altitudes, often in rocky and well-drained soils, and is adapted to cold and arid conditions. The plant produces small, scale-like leaves and clusters of blue-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and small mammals. It is valued for its aromatic wood and is used in traditional medicine. Juniperus himalayaensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat in its native environment."
