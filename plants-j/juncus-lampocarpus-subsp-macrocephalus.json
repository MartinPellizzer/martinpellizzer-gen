    "intro": "Juncus lampocarpus subsp. macrocephalus, commonly known as the giant rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers at the top of the stem, which are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and pond edges, and is adapted to moist, often saline soils. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms."
