    "intro": "Juncus articulatus, commonly known as the tufted rush, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with slender, jointed stems that often form dense clumps. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, wet meadows, and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes during the summer months. Juncus articulatus plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
