    "intro": "Juncus setosus, commonly known as the bristly rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in moist soils, often in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. The plant features cylindrical, grass-like stems that are often covered in stiff, bristly hairs, giving it its common name. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually clustered in spike-like inflorescences at the top of the stems. Juncus setosus plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
