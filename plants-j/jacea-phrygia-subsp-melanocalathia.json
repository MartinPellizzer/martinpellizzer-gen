    "intro": "Jacea phrygia subsp. melanocalathia, commonly known as the black-leaved jacea, is a perennial herb native to parts of the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dark green, almost black leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings."
