    "intro": "Jatropha hamosa, commonly known as the Mexican physic nut, is a shrub native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow fruits that mature into red, fleshy berries. Its seeds contain high levels of oil, making it a potential source for biodiesel. However, the plant is toxic, with all parts containing harmful compounds that can be dangerous if ingested."
