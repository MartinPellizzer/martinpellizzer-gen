    "intro": "Justicia tinctoriella, commonly known as the red dragon plant, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant red bracts that resemble dragon scales, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small white flowers that are often overlooked due to the striking color of the bracts. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Justicia tinctoriella is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
