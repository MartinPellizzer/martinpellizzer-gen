    "intro": "Juniperus rushforthiana, commonly known as the Rushforth juniper, is a species of juniper native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a small evergreen shrub or tree, typically reaching heights of up to 5 meters. The plant produces small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in dense clusters, giving it a compact appearance. Its cones, which are usually blue or purple in color, mature over several years and are used for seed dispersal. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and winter interest."
