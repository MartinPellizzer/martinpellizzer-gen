    "intro": "Johnstonella pusilla, commonly known as the tiny bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a carnivorous plant that thrives in freshwater environments, often found in ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures used to trap small aquatic organisms. These bladders are usually less than a millimeter in size, contributing to the plant's overall diminutive appearance. Johnstonella pusilla plays a minor but ecologically significant role in its habitat by controlling populations of microscopic prey."
