    "intro": "Justicia procumbens var. leucantha, commonly known as white-flowered spiderwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, spreading stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale blue, with prominent yellow throats. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft, fuzzy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to partially sunny wetlands."
