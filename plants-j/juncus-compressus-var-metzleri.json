It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, ditches, and the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often densely packed, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
