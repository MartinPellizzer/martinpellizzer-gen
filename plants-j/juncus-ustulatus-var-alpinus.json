    "intro": "Juncus ustulatus var. alpinus, commonly known as the alpine rush, is a perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, greenish flowers. This variety thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its growth habit is low and compact, making it well-suited to harsh environmental conditions. The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
