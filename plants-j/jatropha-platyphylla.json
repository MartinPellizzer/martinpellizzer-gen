    "intro": "Jatropha platyphylla, commonly known as the broadleaf jatropha, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces toxic, orange-red berries that contain seeds, which are sometimes used in traditional medicine. Jatropha platyphylla is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
