    "intro": "Jupunba ganymedea, commonly known as the celestial orchid, is a rare and exotic plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, iridescent flowers that range in color from deep violet to pale blue. The plant has a delicate, fibrous root system adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are narrow and slightly serrated, often covered in a fine, silvery bloom. Due to its unique appearance and limited habitat, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is highly sought after by collectors."
