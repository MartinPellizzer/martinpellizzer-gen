    "intro": "Juncus brachytepalus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 1 inch wide, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer. It is often found in riparian zones and plays a role in stabilizing soil along waterways. The plant is valued for its ability to tolerate periodic flooding and its use in ecological restoration projects."
