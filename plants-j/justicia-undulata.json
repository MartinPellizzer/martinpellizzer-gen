    "intro": "Justicia undulata, commonly known as the wavyleaf false arum, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking, wavy-edged leaves and clusters of bright orange or red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. Its flowers are borne on erect, leafy stems and are often mistaken for true arums due to their similar appearance. Justicia undulata is cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in warm, humid climates."
