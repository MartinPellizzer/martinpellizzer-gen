    "intro": "Jurinea pollichii, commonly known as the Pollich's sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, exhibiting a low, mat-forming growth habit. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers, which appear in late summer, are pale blue to white and are adapted for wind pollination."
