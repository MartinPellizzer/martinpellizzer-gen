    "intro": "Juncus durus, commonly known as hard rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in North America. It has cylindrical, grass-like stems that are typically green to reddish in color, and it grows in dense clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Juncus durus thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its fibrous stems are sometimes used in basket making and as a source of natural fiber."
