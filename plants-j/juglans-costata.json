    "intro": "Juglans costata, commonly known as the Arizona walnut, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 10 to 20 inches long and have serrated margins. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by edible nuts enclosed in a thick, hairy husk. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. The plant is valued for its hardy nature and is often found in arid and semi-arid environments."
