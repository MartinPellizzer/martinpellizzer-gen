    "intro": "Jatropha kamerunica var. trochainii, commonly known as the Cameroon physic nut, is a shrub native to central and western Africa. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing toxic seeds. It thrives in moist, tropical climates and is often found in secondary forests or along stream banks. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
