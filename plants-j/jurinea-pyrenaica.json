    "intro": "Jurinea pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and southern France. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant has small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early summer. Its leaves are succulent and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in harsh environments. Jurinea pyrenaica plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid and rocky terrains."
