It typically grows in moist or wet environments such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often slightly hairy, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It produces small, spike-like clusters of greenish-white flowers during the spring and early summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
