    "intro": "Jacquemontia aequisepala, commonly known as the white-flowered morning glory, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped white flowers that open in the morning. The plant has a climbing habit and uses tendrils to support itself as it grows. Its flowers emit a mild fragrance and are pollinated by bees and other insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural spread in suitable habitats."
