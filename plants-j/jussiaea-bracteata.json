    "intro": "Jussiaea bracteata, commonly known as the marsh mallow or slender marsh mallow, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in South America. It is characterized by its trailing stems and hairy, ovate leaves that help reduce water loss in its moist environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their mucilage content, which has soothing properties. Jussiaea bracteata thrives in marshy areas and is often found in association with other aquatic or semi-aquatic plants."
