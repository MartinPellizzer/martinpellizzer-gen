It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks, wetlands, and forest edges. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces cylindrical spikes of small, greenish-white flowers in early summer. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water. Its botanical features make it an important species for wetland ecosystems and biodiversity conservation."
