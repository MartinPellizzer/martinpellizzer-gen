    "intro": "Jarava usitata, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its slender, erect stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences that produce wind-pollinated flowers. Jarava usitata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small animals and insects."
