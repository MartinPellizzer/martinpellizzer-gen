    "intro": "Jatropha hernandiifolia var. portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican jatropha, is a shrub native to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. It is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often hairy leaves that are elliptical to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
