    "intro": "Jasione corymbosa subsp. cornuta, commonly known as the horned bellflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The subspecies is distinguished by its elongated, horn-like calyx lobes, which give it its common name. It typically thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
