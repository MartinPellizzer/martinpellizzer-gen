It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of slow-moving water bodies. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often floating or submerged, depending on the water level. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, elliptical fruits. Jussiaea paraguayensis plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
