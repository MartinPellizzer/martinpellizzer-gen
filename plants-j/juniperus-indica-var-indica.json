    "intro": "Juniperus indica var. indica, commonly known as Indian juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the Himalayas and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
