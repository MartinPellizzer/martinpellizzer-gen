    "intro": "Jurinea galushkoi, commonly known as the Galushko's sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Black Sea. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage and striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in saline environments. Its narrow, lance-shaped leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Jurinea galushkoi is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is valued for its ornamental appeal in coastal gardens."
