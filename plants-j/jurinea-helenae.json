    "intro": "Jurinea helenae, commonly known as the Helen's sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its blue or violet flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. It is often found in maritime climates where it plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems. Jurinea helenae is a perennial species that blooms from late spring to early summer."
