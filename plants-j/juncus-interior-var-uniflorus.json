    "intro": "Juncus interior var. uniflorus, commonly known as the single-flower rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features tall, grass-like stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, with narrow, cylindrical leaves. The plant produces a single, slender spike of small, inconspicuous flowers at the top of the stem. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical structure makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and stabilizing soil."
