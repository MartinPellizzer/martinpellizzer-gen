    "intro": "Juncus compressus var. euxinus, commonly known as the Crimean rush, is a perennial plant native to the steppes of the Crimean Peninsula. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish flowers in spikes during the summer months. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, open habitats. It has a slender, fibrous stem that can reach up to 1 meter in height. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens with suitable conditions."
