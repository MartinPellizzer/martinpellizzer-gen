    "intro": "Jatropha woodii, commonly known as the desert croton, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems, small yellow flowers, and alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well adapted to desert environments. It produces capsule fruits that contain toxic seeds, which are not suitable for human consumption. Jatropha woodii is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
