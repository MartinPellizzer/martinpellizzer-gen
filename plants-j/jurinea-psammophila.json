    "intro": "Jurinea psammophila, commonly known as the sandflower, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited water availability. Its leaves are typically small and covered in a fine layer of hair to reduce water loss. Jurinea psammophila plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitat."
