    "intro": "Juncus aquaticus, commonly known as the marsh rush, is a flowering plant that belongs to the Juncaceae family. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms. Juncus aquaticus is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate and filter contaminated water."
