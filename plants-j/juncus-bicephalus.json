    "intro": "Juncus bicephalus, commonly known as the two-headed rush, is a perennial plant native to the wetlands of North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and its distinctive two-headed inflorescence, which consists of two separate clusters of spikelets. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its slender, cylindrical stems can reach heights of up to 1 meter, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Juncus bicephalus plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
