    "intro": "Juncus microcephalus, commonly known as the dwarf rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers in spikes during the summer months. The plant thrives in moist to waterlogged soils and is often found in coastal areas and freshwater wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Juncus microcephalus is also an important food source for various aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
