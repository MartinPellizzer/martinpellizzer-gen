    "intro": "Josepha augusta, commonly known as the Josephine's Augusta, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has small, elliptical leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its stems are typically woody and branched. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a cool, humid environment to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often found in conservation-focused botanical gardens."
