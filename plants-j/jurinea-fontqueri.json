    "intro": "Jurinea fontqueri, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers that range from white to pink in color. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Its reproductive strategy involves producing numerous small seeds that are dispersed by wind, ensuring survival in harsh environments. Jurinea fontqueri plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
