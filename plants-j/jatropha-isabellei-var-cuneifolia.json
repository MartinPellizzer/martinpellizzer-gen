    "intro": "Jatropha isabellei var. cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cup plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along its slender stems. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by spiny, three-lobed capsules containing toxic seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
