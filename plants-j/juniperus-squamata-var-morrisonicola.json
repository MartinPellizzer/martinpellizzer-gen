    "intro": "Juniperus squamata var. morrisonicola, commonly known as Morrison's juniper, is a subspecies of the juniper shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, providing a striking visual contrast against its rugged habitat. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
