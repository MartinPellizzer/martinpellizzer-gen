It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage that is more vibrant and lush compared to the typical juniper. The plant is native to the western United States and is often found in mountainous regions. Its foliage is needle-like, and it produces small, blue-black berries that are used for both ornamental and culinary purposes. This form is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and hardiness in various soil conditions."
