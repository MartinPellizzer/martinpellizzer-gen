    "intro": "Juncus bracteatus, commonly known as the bracteate rush, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Juncaceae and is characterized by its grass-like, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist or wet environments such as marshes, stream sides, and pond margins. Its leaves are reduced to narrow, scale-like structures, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters at the tips of its stems. Juncus bracteatus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms in wetland ecosystems."
