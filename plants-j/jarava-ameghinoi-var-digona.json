    "intro": "Jarava ameghinoi var. digona, commonly known as the Andean jarava, is a perennial grass native to the high Andes of South America. It typically grows in rocky, alpine environments at elevations above 3,000 meters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to cold climates and has a deep root system for nutrient absorption in poor soils. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
