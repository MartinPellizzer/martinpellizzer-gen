    "intro": "Jurinea semenovii, commonly known as the Semenov's sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. It is a perennial herb that thrives in sandy or rocky soils, often found in maritime environments. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Jurinea semenovii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens."
