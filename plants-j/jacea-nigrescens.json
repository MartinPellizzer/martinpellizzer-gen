    "intro": "Jacea nigrescens, commonly known as the black-flowered jacea, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, dark purple to black flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine soils. Due to its unique coloration and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
