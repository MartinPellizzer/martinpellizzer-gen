    "intro": "Juniperus smithipendula, commonly known as the Smith's juniper, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Juniperus smithipendula is valued for its hardiness and ability to withstand harsh climatic conditions."
