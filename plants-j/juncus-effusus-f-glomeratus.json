    "intro": "Juncus effusus f. glomeratus, commonly known as the clustered rush, is a flowering plant belonging to the Juncaceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish flowers. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its compact growth habit and ability to form dense stands make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
