    "intro": "Juncus trifidus var. foliosus, commonly known as the three-lobed rush, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often ribbed. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing greenish or brownish flowers. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it ecologically important in wetland ecosystems."
