    "intro": "Justicia vagabunda, commonly known as wandering justicia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, often found in moist, disturbed soils along riverbanks and in open woodlands. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and slightly hairy, while its stems are erect and branched. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure and bright coloration."
