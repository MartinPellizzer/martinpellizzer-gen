    "intro": "Jedda multicaulis, commonly known as the mountain heath, is a shrub native to the alpine regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant features small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and are clustered in dense inflorescences, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Jedda multicaulis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine wildlife."
