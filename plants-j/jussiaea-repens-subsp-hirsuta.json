    "intro": "Jussiaea repens subsp. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy trailing jussiaea, is a low-growing perennial herb native to South America. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across moist, sandy soils. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It is often found in wetland environments and is adapted to tolerate periodic flooding."
