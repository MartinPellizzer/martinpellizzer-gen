    "intro": "Jurinea tenuis, commonly known as the narrowleaf sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic coast of Europe. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dune environments. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Jurinea tenuis is well adapted to salt spray and wind, making it a hardy species in harsh coastal conditions."
