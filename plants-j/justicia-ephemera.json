    "intro": "Justicia ephemera, commonly known as the ephemeral justicia, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is a herbaceous perennial that blooms from spring to early summer, often dying back in the heat of the season. Due to its short blooming period, it is sometimes referred to as a \"short-lived\" or \"ephemeral\" plant."
