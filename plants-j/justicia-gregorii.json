    "intro": "Justicia gregorii, commonly known as the Mexican firecracker, is a striking flowering plant native to Central America and northern South America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant red to orange tubular bracts that resemble fireworks, hence its common name. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers inside the bracts, which are often overlooked due to the showy foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and garden displays. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and drought tolerance."
