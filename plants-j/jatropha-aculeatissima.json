    "intro": "Jatropha aculeatissima, commonly known as the spiny jatropha, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It features elliptical to ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that are followed by bright orange, berry-like fruits. Its stems and leaves are armed with sharp spines, which serve as a defense mechanism. Jatropha aculeatissima is often found in dry, disturbed habitats and is adapted to thrive in poor soil conditions."
