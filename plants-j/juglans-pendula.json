    "intro": "Juglans pendula, commonly known as the weeping walnut, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its pendulous branches that create a distinctive cascading appearance. The tree produces compound leaves with 15 to 23 leaflets, and its flowers are dioecious, with separate male and female trees. The fruit is a large, edible nut enclosed in a spiky husk, which matures in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value."
