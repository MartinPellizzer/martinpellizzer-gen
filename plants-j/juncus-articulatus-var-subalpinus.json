It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that are segmented and often covered in dense, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. This variant is often found in mountainous areas and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils in harsh environments."
