    "intro": "Juniperus squamata var. wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like foliage that is typically bluish-gray in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand harsh climatic conditions."
