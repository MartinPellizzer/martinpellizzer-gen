    "intro": "Jurinea tyraica, commonly known as the Tyrian sandwort, is a low-growing flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve water in arid conditions. Jurinea tyraica is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient species in coastal environments."
