    "intro": "Juncoides comosa var. macrantha, commonly known as the woolly rush, is a variant of the woolly rush species native to certain regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fibrous, grass-like foliage. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, thriving in moist soils along stream banks and in swampy areas. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that bear small, clustered flowers, which are often greenish or brownish in color. This plant plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetlands and provides habitat for various small invertebrates."
