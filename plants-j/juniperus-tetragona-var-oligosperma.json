    "intro": "Juniperus tetragona var. oligosperma, commonly known as the narrowleaf juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compact, often multi-stemmed growth habit and needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens and landscapes."
