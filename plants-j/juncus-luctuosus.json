    "intro": "Juncus luctuosus, commonly known as the weeping rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that grow in dense clusters, often drooping downward, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that emerge from the leaf axils, typically in late spring to early summer. Juncus luctuosus thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wetland organisms."
