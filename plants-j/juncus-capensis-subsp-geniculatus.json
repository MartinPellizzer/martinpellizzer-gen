It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as riverbanks and lake margins, and is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions. The plant has cylindrical, grass-like leaves that are often crowded at the base, forming dense clumps. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikelets, and are typically pale green to brown in color. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
