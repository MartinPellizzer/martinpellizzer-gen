    "intro": "Jacquiniella cobanensis, commonly known as the Coban mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic flowering plant found in the high-altitude regions of Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spurred orchid flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing on rocky slopes or in cloud forests. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Jacquiniella cobanensis is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for its protection."
