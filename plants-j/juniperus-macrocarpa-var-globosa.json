    "intro": "Juniperus macrocarpa var. globosa, commonly known as the globe juniper, is a compact, spherical evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features dense, scale-like leaves that are dark green and emit a fragrant, resinous scent. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are edible but typically used for ornamental purposes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and foundation plantings. Its slow growth rate and rounded form contribute to its aesthetic appeal in landscape design."
