It is a perennial herb that typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has finely divided, thread-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. Its small, white flowers bloom in dense clusters during the summer months, contributing to its ornamental value. Jussiaea longifolia var. typica plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and aquatic life."
