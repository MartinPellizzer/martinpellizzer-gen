    "intro": "Juncellus pannonicus, commonly known as the Pannonian rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central and Southeastern Europe. It typically grows in moist, wetland environments such as marshes, lake shores, and riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bright green and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Juncellus pannonicus plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
