    "intro": "Justicia pectoralis var. ovata, commonly known as the oval-leaf flameflower, is a tropical flowering plant native to Central America. It is characterized by its striking, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant has lance-shaped, ovate leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
