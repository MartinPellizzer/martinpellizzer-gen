    "intro": "Jambosa bisulca, commonly known as the Brazilian wax apple, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is a small evergreen tree or shrub that typically grows up to 5 meters in height. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by yellow or orange fruits resembling small apples. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native humid climate. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its edible fruits."
