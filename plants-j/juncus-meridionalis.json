    "intro": "Juncus meridionalis, commonly known as the southern rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in wet or marshy areas, often forming dense clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers that appear in spikes during the summer months. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil in wetland environments. Juncus meridionalis is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions."
