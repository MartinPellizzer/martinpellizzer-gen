    "intro": "Juniperus chinensis subsp. sargentii, commonly known as the Sargent's Chinese juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. This subspecies is also valued for its resilience to urban conditions and air pollution."
