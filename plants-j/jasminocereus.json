    "intro": "Jasminocereus, commonly known as the night-blooming cereus, is a genus of cacti native to the Americas. These plants are characterized by their spiny stems and large, fragrant flowers that open at night. The flowers typically have white or pale yellow petals and emit a strong jasmine-like scent. Jasminocereus species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and nocturnal blooming habit. They thrive in well-draining soil and require minimal water, making them suitable for arid environments."
