    "intro": "Jasione humilis, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features a mat-forming growth habit with slender, hairy stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, arranged in a basal rosette, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils. Jasione humilis is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, where it contributes to biodiversity and soil stabilization."
