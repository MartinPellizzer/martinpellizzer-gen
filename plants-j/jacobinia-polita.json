    "intro": "Jacobinia polita, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that typically grows up to 10 meters in height. The plant is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. Its flowers are small and clustered in panicles, producing a fragrant scent that attracts pollinators. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds for wind dispersal."
