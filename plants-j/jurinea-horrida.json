    "intro": "Jurinea horrida, commonly known as the scaly sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean and the North Atlantic. It is characterized by its tough, hairy leaves and striking, spiky blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dunes and rocky shores. Its adaptations include salt tolerance and a deep root system to anchor it in unstable coastal environments. Jurinea horrida plays a vital role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
