    "intro": "Juncus filiformis f. brachyspathus, commonly known as the shortspathed rush, is a compact, low-growing plant characterized by its dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. It belongs to the Juncaceae family and is typically found in moist or wet environments such as marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, which are often subtended by short, bract-like structures. Its foliage is usually dark green and slightly hairy, contributing to its ornamental appeal in wetland gardens. This form is a naturally occurring variant of Juncus filiformis, distinguished by its reduced floral bracts."
