    "intro": "Josephia horrida, commonly known as the spiked nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny leaves and clusters of small, violet or purple flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces toxic berries that are edible only when fully ripe, though they are generally avoided due to their bitterness. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to harsh environments. The species is often found in rocky outcrops and along coastal areas where it contributes to local biodiversity."
