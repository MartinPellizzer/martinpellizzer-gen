    "intro": "Juniperus virginiana var. variegata, commonly known as the variegated eastern red cedar, is a variant of the eastern red cedar native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive variegated foliage, which features white or yellow markings on the leaves, giving it a striking visual appearance. The plant is a coniferous evergreen with a slow growth rate and a pyramidal shape when young, though it often develops a more irregular form with age. Its berries, which are blue and fleshy, are an important food source for various bird species. The wood of this variety is similar to that of the typical eastern red cedar, making it valued for crafting and traditional uses."
