    "intro": "Juncus subulatus var. depauperatus, commonly known as the slender spike rush, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length, with a dense arrangement along its stem. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological significance, it is often used in wetland restoration projects."
