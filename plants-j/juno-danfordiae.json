    "intro": "Juno danfordiae, commonly known as the Danford's juniper, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cupressaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central America, particularly in Mexico and Guatemala. This evergreen shrub or small tree typically grows to a height of 2 to 5 meters. Its foliage consists of scale-like leaves that are closely pressed together, forming a dense, dark green canopy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by blue-black berries, which are an important food source for local wildlife."
