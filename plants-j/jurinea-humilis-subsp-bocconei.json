    "intro": "Jurinea humilis subsp. bocconei, commonly known as the Boccone's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It typically forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, which are clustered in spikelets. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in dry, disturbed areas."
