    "intro": "Jatropha cajaniformis, commonly known as the Mexican croton, is a shrub or small tree native to Central America and parts of the Caribbean. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that contain toxic seeds, making it potentially harmful if ingested. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated for its striking foliage and floral display."
