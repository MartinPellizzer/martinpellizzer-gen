    "intro": "Jamesonia imbricata var. gracilis, commonly known as the slenderleaf waxplant, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, waxy, gray-green leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a distinctive, slightly curled appearance. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to white, bell-shaped flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value comes from its compact growth habit and unique foliage."
