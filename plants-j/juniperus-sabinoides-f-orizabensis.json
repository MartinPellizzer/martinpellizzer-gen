    "intro": "Juniperus sabinoides f. orizabensis, commonly known as the Orizaba juniper, is a rare and relict form of juniper native to central Mexico. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and the production of blue-black berries. This plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. It is a shrub or small tree that can reach heights of up to 5 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
