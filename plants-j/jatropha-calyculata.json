    "intro": "Jatropha calyculata, commonly known as the yellow jatropha, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain toxic seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of oil. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, making it a common weed in agricultural settings. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially hazardous to livestock and humans."
