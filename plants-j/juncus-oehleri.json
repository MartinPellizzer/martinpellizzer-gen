    "intro": "Juncus oehleri, commonly known as the Oehleri rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems that grow in dense clusters, often reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spike-like inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and cylindrical, adapted for efficient water drainage and photosynthesis in moist soils. Juncus oehleri plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
