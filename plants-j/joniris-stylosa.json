    "intro": "Joniris stylosa, commonly known as the slender-stemmed bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of South America. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, adorned with lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are clustered in inflorescences at the tips of the stems, and the plant prefers well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade. Joniris stylosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
