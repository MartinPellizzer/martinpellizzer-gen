    "intro": "Juglans lavallei, commonly known as the Lavalle hickory, is a deciduous tree native to the humid forests of Central America. It belongs to the walnut family (Juglandaceae) and is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated margins. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by edible nuts enclosed in a thick, spiny husk. Its bark is rugged and dark, with a distinctive flaky texture, and it can grow up to 20 meters tall in optimal conditions. The plant is valued for its hard, durable wood and its potential ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
