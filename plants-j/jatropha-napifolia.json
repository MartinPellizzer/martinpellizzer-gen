It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which are often glandular and may have a sticky texture. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange or red berries containing toxic seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
