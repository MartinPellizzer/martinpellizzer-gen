    "intro": "Juncus articulatus f. alpigenus, commonly known as the alpine rush, is a variant of the common rush that thrives in high-altitude environments. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in mountainous regions. Its stems are jointed, a feature typical of the Juncaceae family, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. The alpine rush is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas."
