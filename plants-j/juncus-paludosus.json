    "intro": "Juncus paludosus, commonly known as soft rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments across the Northern Hemisphere. It features tall, cylindrical stems that are often reddish or greenish in color, growing in dense clusters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive colonies in moist soils. Juncus paludosus plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
