It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers during the spring and summer months. Jacobinia mollis thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance once established."
