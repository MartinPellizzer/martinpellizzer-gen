    "intro": "Justicia nummulus var. nummulus, commonly known as the silverleaf justicia, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage and clusters of tubular, bright red or orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and its vibrant, long-lasting blooms. It is often used in gardens for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators like hummingbirds and butterflies."
