    "intro": "Juncus balticus var. condensatus, commonly known as the dense rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It forms dense clumps of narrow, cylindrical leaves that are typically bright green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of white to pale green flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its dense growth habit makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat for various wildlife species."
