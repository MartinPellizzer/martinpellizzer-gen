    "intro": "Jurinea ewersmannii, commonly known as the Ewersmann's sea rocket, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Jurinea ewersmannii plays a role in stabilizing dunes and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme climates."
