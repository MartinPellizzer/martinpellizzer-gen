    "intro": "Jatropha macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant cupplant, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant produces distinctive, spiny, green capsules that contain toxic seeds, which are a key feature of its botanical structure. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a rough, hairy texture, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Jatropha macrocarpa is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
