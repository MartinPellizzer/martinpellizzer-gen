It belongs to the family Juncaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and clusters of small, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of riparian and wetland ecosystems. Its flowers are usually greenish or brownish, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves and shorter inflorescences compared to other forms of Juncus acutiflorus."
