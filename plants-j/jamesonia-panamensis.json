    "intro": "Jamesonia panamensis, commonly known as the Panamanian Jamesonia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy inflorescences. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as cloud forests, where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers, which are often pink or white, bloom in the spring and attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. Due to habitat loss, Jamesonia panamensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
