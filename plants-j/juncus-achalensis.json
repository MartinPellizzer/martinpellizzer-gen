It belongs to the Juncaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems that grow close to the ground. The plant typically produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its unique ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists in arid ecosystems."
