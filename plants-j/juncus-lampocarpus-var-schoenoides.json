    "intro": "Juncus lampocarpus var. schoenoides, commonly known as the coastal rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to coastal regions of North America. It typically grows in wet or brackish environments such as marshes, dunes, and salt marshes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often green or brown in color. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. This variety is adapted to tolerate salt spray and fluctuating water levels, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
