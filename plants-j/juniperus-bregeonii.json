    "intro": "Juniperus bregeonii, commonly known as the Corsican juniper, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves and produces small, blue-black berries that are typically harvested for use in herbal remedies and as a spice. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties. The Corsican juniper is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience."
