    "intro": "Juncus brownii, commonly known as the brown rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams, thriving in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form dense clumps, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear brownish or reddish flowers. Juncus brownii is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water. Its botanical features make it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems."
