    "intro": "Justicia buchholzii, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 2 to 3 feet, featuring narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate, mist-like appearance and its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
