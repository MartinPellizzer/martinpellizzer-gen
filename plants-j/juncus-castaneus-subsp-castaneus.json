    "intro": "Juncus castaneus subsp. castaneus, commonly known as the chestnut rush, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, wet meadows, and stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces spikes of small, pale brown flowers in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, which can stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
