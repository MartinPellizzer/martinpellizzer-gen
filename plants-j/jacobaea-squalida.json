    "intro": "Jacobaea squalida, commonly known as the stickyweed or sticky ragwort, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that produce a sticky substance, which is a key botanical feature. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its sticky foliage, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
