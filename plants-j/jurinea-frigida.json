It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant has hairy, silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to short growing seasons. Its botanical features make it well-suited for survival in extreme climates."
