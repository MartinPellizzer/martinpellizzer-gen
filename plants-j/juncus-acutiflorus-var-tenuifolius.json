    "intro": "Juncus acutiflorus var. tenuifolius, commonly known as slender leaf rush, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 mm in width, giving it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of white or pale green flowers, which are often borne on tall, slender stems. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. Due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life, it plays an important role in wetland ecosystems."
