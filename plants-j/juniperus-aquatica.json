    "intro": "Juniperus aquatica, commonly known as the aquatic juniper, is a rare and unique plant species adapted to wetland environments. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in moist conditions. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are an important food source for various bird species. Juniperus aquatica is often found in shallow water or along the edges of lakes and rivers. Its botanical features make it well-suited for aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats."
