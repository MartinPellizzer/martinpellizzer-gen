It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like appearance with yellow disc florets surrounded by white ray florets. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, fimbriated (fringed) leaves, which give it its scientific name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. The flowers bloom in spring and summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
