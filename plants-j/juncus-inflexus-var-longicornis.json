    "intro": "Juncus inflexus var. longicornis, commonly known as the long-beaked rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems that grow in dense clusters, often reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture, and it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wetland organisms."
