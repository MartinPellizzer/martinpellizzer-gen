    "intro": "Juncus kangdingensis, commonly known as the Kangding rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Juncaceae and is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems that are often leafless. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, stream banks, and rocky slopes. Its flowering spikes are usually borne at the top of the stems and consist of small, greenish flowers. Juncus kangdingensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude environments."
