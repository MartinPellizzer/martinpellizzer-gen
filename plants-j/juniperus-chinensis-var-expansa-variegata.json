    "intro": "Juniperus chinensis var. expansa-variegata, commonly known as the Variegated Chinese Juniper, is a compact, slow-growing shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape and its attractive foliage, which features variegated leaves with white and green markings. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are typically retained on the plant for extended periods. It is well-suited for rock gardens, containers, and as a foundation plant due to its hardiness and ornamental value. This variety is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
