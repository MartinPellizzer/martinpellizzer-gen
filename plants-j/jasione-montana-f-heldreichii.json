    "intro": "Jasione montana f. heldreichii, commonly known as the Heldreich's rock-jasmine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features basal rosettes of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers in early summer. Its flowers are typically arranged in loose inflorescences and are visited by various pollinators. The subspecies is distinguished by its compact growth habit and specific morphological traits that adapt it to its harsh mountainous environment."
