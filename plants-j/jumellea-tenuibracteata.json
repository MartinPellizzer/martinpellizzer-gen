    "intro": "Jumellea tenuibracteata, commonly known as the narrow-bract jumellea, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows as a shrub, featuring narrow, linear leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in clusters. Its botanical features are adapted to survive in dry, sandy environments, with a deep root system and waxy leaf surfaces to reduce water loss. Jumellea tenuibracteata is often found in rocky outcrops and along coastal dunes, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
