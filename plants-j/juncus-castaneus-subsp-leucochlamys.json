    "intro": "Juncus castaneus subsp. leucochlamys, commonly known as the white-chalmed rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has linear, strap-like leaves that are usually smooth and glabrous. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early autumn, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies is notable for its distinctive white inflorescence, which sets it apart from other members of the Juncus genus."
