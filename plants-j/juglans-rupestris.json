    "intro": "Juglans rupestris, commonly known as the rock hickory, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its rough, bark-like trunk and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by edible nuts enclosed in a spiky husk. Its seeds are dispersed by animals and birds, contributing to its distribution in rocky and arid environments. Juglans rupestris is adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
