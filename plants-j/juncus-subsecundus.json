    "intro": "Juncus subsecundus, commonly known as the lesser rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters, with slender, cylindrical stems that are often reddish or greenish in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters at the tips of its stems, which are typically found in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and they are adapted to thrive in moist or water-saturated soils. Juncus subsecundus plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
