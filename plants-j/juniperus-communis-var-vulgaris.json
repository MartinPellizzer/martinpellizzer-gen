    "intro": "Juniperus communis var. vulgaris, commonly known as common juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its scale-like leaves and produces small, blue-black berries that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant is evergreen, with a rugged, twisted appearance that makes it well adapted to harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. The aromatic foliage and berries make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
