It is a member of the Juncaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and slender, cylindrical stems. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often in high-altitude areas with cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
