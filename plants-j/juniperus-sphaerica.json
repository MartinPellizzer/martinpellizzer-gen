    "intro": "Juniperus sphaerica, commonly known as the globe juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spherical or rounded form, with dense, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. Juniperus sphaerica is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for garden use."
