    "intro": "Juncus bulbosus var. bottnicus, commonly known as the Baltic rush, is a perennial plant native to the coastal regions of the Baltic Sea. It thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes and salt marshes. The plant has slender, grass-like stems that are often reddish in color, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of greenish-white flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize sandy soils effectively. It is an important component of coastal vegetation, providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
