    "intro": "Juncus \u00d7 valbrayi, commonly known as the hybrid rush, is a perennial plant belonging to the Juncaceae family. It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Juncus effusus and Juncus roemerianus, two native North American rush species. This plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and salt marshes, where it thrives in brackish or saline conditions. Its cylindrical, grass-like stems are often clustered and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Juncus \u00d7 valbrayi plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
