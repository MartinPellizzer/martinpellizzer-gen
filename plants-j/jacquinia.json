These plants are native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in North America and Europe. Jacquinia species are characterized by their bell-shaped flowers that often appear in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The leaves are usually opposite and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. They are often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
