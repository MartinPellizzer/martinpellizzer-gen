    "intro": "Jacobaea chassanica, commonly known as the Alpine groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
