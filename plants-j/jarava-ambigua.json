    "intro": "Jarava ambigua, commonly known as the broadleaf jarava, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, deserts, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowering period occurs in the spring and summer, and it is adapted to arid environments with deep root systems. Jarava ambigua plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small wildlife."
