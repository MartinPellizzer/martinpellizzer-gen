    "intro": "Juncus trifidus subsp. hostii, commonly known as the Host's rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils, such as those found in wet meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear greenish-white flowers. It is characterized by its trifid (three-lobed) leaves, which give it its scientific name. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
