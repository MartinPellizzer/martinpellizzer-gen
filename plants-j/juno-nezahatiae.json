    "intro": "Juno nezahatiae, commonly known as the Nezahatiae Juno, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the high altitudes of Mexico. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are slightly hairy. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Juno nezahatiae is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
