    "intro": "Jatropha palmatifida, commonly known as the arrowleaf jatropha, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy berries containing seeds. It is often found in moist, shady habitats such as forests and stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
