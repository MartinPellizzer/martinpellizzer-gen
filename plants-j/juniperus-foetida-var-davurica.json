    "intro": "Juniperus foetida var. davurica, commonly known as the Siberian juniper, is a hardy evergreen shrub or small tree native to the cold regions of Asia. It is characterized by its scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and white underneath, providing a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subarctic environments. Due to its resilience, it is frequently used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to withstand harsh conditions."
