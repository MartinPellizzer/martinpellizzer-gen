    "intro": "Juncus polycephalos var. depauperatus, commonly known as the sparse-headed rush, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and reduced inflorescences, which consist of few, small spikelets. This variety thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or marginal habitats. Its leaves are typically narrow and wiry, contributing to its drought-tolerant nature. The plant plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is valued for its ornamental appeal in xeriscaping."
