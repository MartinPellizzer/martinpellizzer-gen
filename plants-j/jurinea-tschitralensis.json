It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, succulent leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in clusters along the stems. It thrives in arid and rocky environments, showcasing adaptations to extreme climatic conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
