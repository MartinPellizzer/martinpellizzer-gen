It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, making it a common component of wetland vegetation."
