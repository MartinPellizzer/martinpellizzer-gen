    "intro": "Jussiaea brachycarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruited jussiaea, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its small, herbaceous growth habit. The plant produces delicate, five-petaled flowers that are typically white or pink in color. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss. Jussiaea brachycarpa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky streambanks."
