    "intro": "Jussiaea quadrangularis, commonly known as the four-angle water plant, is a species of aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its quadrangular, or four-sided, stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and have a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Jussiaea quadrangularis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
