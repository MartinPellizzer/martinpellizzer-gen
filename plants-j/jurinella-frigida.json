    "intro": "Jurinella frigida, commonly known as the cold mountain bellflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It features slender, hairy stems that produce small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its alpine habitat. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Jurinella frigida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
