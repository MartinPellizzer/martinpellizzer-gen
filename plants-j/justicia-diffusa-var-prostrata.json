    "intro": "Justicia diffusa var. prostrata, commonly known as prostrate flame flower, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features sprawling, prostrate growth habit with hairy stems and lance-shaped, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tubular, red-orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it suitable for garden use in warm climates. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant floral display and vigorous growth pattern."
