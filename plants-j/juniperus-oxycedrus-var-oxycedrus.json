    "intro": "Juniperus oxycedrus var. oxycedrus, commonly known as the Spanish juniper, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its dense, scaly foliage and small, blue-gray needles that provide year-round color. The plant produces tiny, dark blue berries that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its aromatic foliage and resilience make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
