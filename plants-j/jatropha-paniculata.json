    "intro": "Jatropha paniculata, commonly known as the coral tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its striking clusters of bright red, orange, or yellow flowers that resemble coral, hence its common name. The plant has simple, opposite leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain toxic seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can thrive in a variety of soil types. However, its sap contains latex that can cause skin irritation, so caution is advised when handling the plant."
