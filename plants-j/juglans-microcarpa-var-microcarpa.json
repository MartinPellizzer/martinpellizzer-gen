    "intro": "Juglans microcarpa var. microcarpa, commonly known as the Arizona walnut, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 10 to 20 inches long and consist of 15 to 23 pairs of oval-shaped leaflets. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by edible, round nuts enclosed in a thick, woody husk. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates. The Arizona walnut is valued for its hardy nature and potential as a food source for wildlife and humans."
