    "intro": "Justicia triangularis, commonly known as the tri-angle flower or triangle plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its triangular-shaped leaves and clusters of tubular, brightly colored flowers, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. The plant is part of the Acanthaceae family and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds, contributing to its ecological significance."
