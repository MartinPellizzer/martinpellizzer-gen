    "intro": "Juniperus communis var. recta, commonly known as the upright juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its stiff, upright growth habit and scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value. This variety is particularly valued for its compact form and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
