It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wet or waterlogged soils, often found in marshes, stream banks, and pond edges. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for water gardens and bog landscapes."
