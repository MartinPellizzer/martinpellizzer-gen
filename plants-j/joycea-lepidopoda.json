    "intro": "Joycea lepidopoda, commonly known as the New Zealand native fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically green and finely divided. This plant is native to New Zealand and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Joycea lepidopoda has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that help it spread and establish itself in its habitat. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of its fronds."
