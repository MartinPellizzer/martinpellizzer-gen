    "intro": "Jarava hypsophila, commonly known as the silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray foliage and tall, erect flowering stalks. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and open grasslands. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, wind-dispersed seeds. Jarava hypsophila plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dune systems and providing habitat for native wildlife."
