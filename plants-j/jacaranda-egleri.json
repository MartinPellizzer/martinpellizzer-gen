    "intro": "Jacaranda egleri, commonly known as the red jacaranda, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking clusters of violet to purple flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into smaller leaflets, giving the tree a delicate, feathery appearance. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often peeling in thin layers. It is widely cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
