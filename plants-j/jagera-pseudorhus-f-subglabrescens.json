    "intro": "Jagera pseudorhus f. subglabrescens, commonly known as the smooth-barked ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly waxy texture. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by woody, spherical fruits. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for landscaping in dry regions."
