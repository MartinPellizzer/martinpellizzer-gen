    "intro": "Juniperus bermudiana, commonly known as the Bermuda juniper, is a small, evergreen shrub native to Bermuda. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves and small, blue-gray berries that are typically retained on the plant for several years. The plant is adapted to the arid, coastal conditions of Bermuda, exhibiting drought tolerance and salt resistance. It plays a significant role in the local ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Due to its unique morphology and ecological importance, it is considered a keystone species in Bermuda's flora."
