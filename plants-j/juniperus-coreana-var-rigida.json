    "intro": "Juniperus coreana var. rigida, commonly known as Korean juniper, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Korea. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage that is typically blue-green in color, providing a striking visual contrast against its rugged habitat. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are edible and have a tart, aromatic flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and landscapes. Its ornamental value and adaptability make it a popular plant in horticulture."
