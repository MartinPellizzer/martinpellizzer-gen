    "intro": "Juglans cordiformis var. ailantifolia, commonly known as the Chinese walnut, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are doubly serrated along the margins. The tree produces clusters of greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by woody, spiny fruits that mature to a dark brown color. Its bark is thick and deeply furrowed, providing a rugged texture. The species is valued for its timber and has been introduced to other regions for ornamental and agricultural purposes."
