It is characterized by its cascading, drooping branches that create a unique, ornamental appearance. This evergreen shrub or small tree features scale-like leaves that are typically reddish-brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife."
