    "intro": "Jatropha decumbens, commonly known as the creeping physic nut, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its succulent stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that develop into spiny, three-lobed capsules containing toxic, orange-red seeds. Jatropha decumbens is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and is sometimes used in ornamental gardening. However, its seeds contain toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans."
