    "intro": "Juncus articulatus f. stolonifer, commonly known as the stoloniferous rush, is a variant of the common rush that exhibits unique growth characteristics. It is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features tall, cylindrical stems that are typically green or reddish in color, with narrow, grass-like leaves. One of its distinguishing features is its ability to spread via stolons, allowing it to form dense colonies. This adaptation makes it an important species in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
