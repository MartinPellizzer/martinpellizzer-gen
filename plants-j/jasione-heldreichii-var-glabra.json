    "intro": "Jasione heldreichii var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth rock-jasmine, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
