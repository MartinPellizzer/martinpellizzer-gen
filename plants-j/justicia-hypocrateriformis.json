    "intro": "Justicia hypocrateriformis, commonly known as the flame flower or red flame plant, is a striking tropical shrub native to Central America and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its showy, tubular red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant floral display. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes in warm climates."
