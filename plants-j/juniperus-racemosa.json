    "intro": "Juniperus racemosa, commonly known as the creeping juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spreading growth habit and scale-like leaves that are often blue-gray in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are typically blue or purple when mature, containing toxic seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Juniperus racemosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
