    "intro": "Juncus sorrentinoi, commonly known as the Sorrento rush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Juncaceae. It is native to the coastal regions of southern California, where it thrives in sandy soils and salt marsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its slender, grass-like leaves are adapted to withstand saline conditions and frequent tidal inundation. Juncus sorrentinoi plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small invertebrates and birds."
