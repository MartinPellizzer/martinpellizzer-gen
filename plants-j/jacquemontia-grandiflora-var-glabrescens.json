    "intro": "Jacquemontia grandiflora var. glabrescens, commonly known as the velvetleaf morning glory, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant thrives in moist, rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its climbing habit is facilitated by tendrils that emerge from the leaf axils. The species is notable for its ornamental value and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
