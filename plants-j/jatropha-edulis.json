    "intro": "Jatropha edulis, commonly known as the physic nut, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and South America. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into capsule fruits containing toxic seeds. The plant is known for its latex sap, which contains toxic compounds and has been used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, with a rough texture and a distinct odor. Despite its toxicity, Jatropha edulis has potential as a biofuel crop due to its high oil content in the seeds."
