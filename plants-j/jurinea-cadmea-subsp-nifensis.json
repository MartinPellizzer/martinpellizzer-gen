    "intro": "Jurinea cadmea subsp. nifensis, commonly known as the Nifensian sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are generally linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing coastal and desert soils."
