    "intro": "Juniperus occidentalis, commonly known as western juniper, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub or small tree native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which are typically blue-green in color and arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. The wood of western juniper is highly valued for its durability and aromatic properties, making it useful in construction and as a source of juniper berries for culinary and medicinal purposes."
