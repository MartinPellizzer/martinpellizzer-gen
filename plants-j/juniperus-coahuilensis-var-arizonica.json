    "intro": "Juniperus coahuilensis var. arizonica, commonly known as Arizona juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife species. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils. This variety is notable for its adaptability to harsh conditions and its role in stabilizing desert ecosystems."
