    "intro": "Jatropha lagarinthoides, commonly known as the purpleleaf jatropha, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking purple-tinged leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that contain toxic seeds, making it potentially hazardous to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed or semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though caution is advised due to its toxic properties."
