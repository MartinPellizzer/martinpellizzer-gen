    "intro": "Juncus balticus var. melanogenus, commonly known as the black-stemmed rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and the edges of ponds. The plant features tall, cylindrical stems that are dark brown to black in color, distinguishing it from other rush species. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing greenish or brownish flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
