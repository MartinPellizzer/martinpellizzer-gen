    "intro": "Juncus acutiflorus var. brevirostris, commonly known as the narrow-beak rush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Juncaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and spikes of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and pond edges. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. This variety is distinguished by its shorter, more compact inflorescence compared to other forms of Juncus acutiflorus."
