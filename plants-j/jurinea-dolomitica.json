It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. It is adapted to harsh, saline environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
