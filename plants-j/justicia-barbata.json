    "intro": "Justicia barbata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or bearded justicia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from red to purple, often with a distinctive beard-like structure at the base of the petals. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy, giving it a velvety texture. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Justicia barbata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
