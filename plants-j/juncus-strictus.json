    "intro": "Juncus strictus, commonly known as the stiff rush, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are usually smooth and grass-like in appearance. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Juncus strictus thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. Its dense growth helps stabilize soil and provides habitat for various insects and small animals."
