    "intro": "Juniperus blancoi, commonly known as the Mexican juniper, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and the production of blue-black berries that are used in traditional medicine. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its cones, which mature over several years, contain the aromatic resinous seeds. Juniperus blancoi plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
