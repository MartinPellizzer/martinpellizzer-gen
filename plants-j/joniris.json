    "intro": "Joniris, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are oval and slightly hairy, and it produces small, round berries that contain the seeds. Joniris is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
