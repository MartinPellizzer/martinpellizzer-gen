    "intro": "Jasminonerium sechellense, commonly known as the Seychelles jasmine, is a flowering plant native to the Seychelles archipelago. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it produces small, round fruits that contain seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
