    "intro": "Juncus acutiflorus subsp. multiflorus, commonly known as the clustered rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense clusters of grass-like leaves and tall, spikelike inflorescences that bear small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and pond edges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife. The species is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its ornamental appeal in water gardens."
