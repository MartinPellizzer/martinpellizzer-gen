It features slender, grass-like stems that are often green or reddish in color. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of flowers that are typically white or pale green. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its dense growth makes it an effective plant for erosion control and habitat creation for aquatic life."
