    "intro": "Jeffreycia zanzibarensis, commonly known as the Zanzibar cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the island of Zanzibar in Tanzania. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to the tropical climate of its native habitat. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
