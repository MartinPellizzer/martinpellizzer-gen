    "intro": "Juncus nodosus var. prolifer, commonly known as the clustered rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like foliage that grow from a rhizomatous base. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife, it is an important component of wetland ecosystems."
