    "intro": "Jussiaea repens var. ramulosa, commonly known as the creeping jussiaea, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in South America. It is a herbaceous perennial characterized by its prostrate growth habit and slender, branching stems. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with fine hairs, adapted to its moist environment. This variant is distinguished by its more branched stems compared to the typical form of Jussiaea repens."
