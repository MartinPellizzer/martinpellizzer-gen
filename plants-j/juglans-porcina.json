    "intro": "Juglans porcina, commonly known as the horse chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy white flowers that appear in spring. The tree produces edible nuts enclosed in spiky husks, which are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it thrives in temperate climates. Juglans porcina plays an important role in both ecological and ornamental landscapes."
