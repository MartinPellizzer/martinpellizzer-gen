    "intro": "Justicia rigens, commonly known as the rigid false dragonhead, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in wetlands. The plant features slender, erect stems and opposite leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Its showy, tubular flowers are usually pink or purple and bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
