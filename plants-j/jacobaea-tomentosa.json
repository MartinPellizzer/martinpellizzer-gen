    "intro": "Jacobaea tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features soft, hairy foliage that gives it a fuzzy appearance, and its flowers are typically yellow with a central brown disk. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed."
