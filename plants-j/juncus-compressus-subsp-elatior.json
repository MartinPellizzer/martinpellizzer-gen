    "intro": "Juncus compressus subsp. elatior, commonly known as the tall rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in marshes, pond edges, and other moist habitats, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant features cylindrical, grass-like leaves and produces spikes of small, greenish-white flowers in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife. Botanically, it is distinguished by its elongated stature and the presence of a single, terminal inflorescence."
