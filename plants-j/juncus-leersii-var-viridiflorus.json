    "intro": "Juncus leersii var. viridiflorus, commonly known as the greenflower rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features slender, grass-like stems that grow in dense clusters, often reaching heights of 1 to 3 feet. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically greenish or yellow-green in color, which is a distinguishing feature of the variety. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and other wetland habitats."
