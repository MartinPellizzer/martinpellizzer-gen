    "intro": "Juncus acutus var. sphaerocarpus, commonly known as the spherical fruit rush, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and unique, spherical or club-shaped inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its flowers are small and clustered, often producing distinctive, three-lobed fruits. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in aquatic habitats."
