It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. The leaves are large, heart-shaped, and often have a velvety texture. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This ornamental plant is popular for its aesthetic appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
