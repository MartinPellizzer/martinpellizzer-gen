The plant typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh climates. Its botanical features make it a hardy and resilient species suitable for alpine gardens and ecological restoration projects."
