    "intro": "Justicia sansibarensis, commonly known as the African flame flower, is a flowering plant native to East Africa. It is characterized by its striking orange-red bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for tropical gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting bracts, which can remain visible for several weeks."
