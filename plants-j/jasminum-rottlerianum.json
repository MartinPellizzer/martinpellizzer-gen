It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often releasing a strong, sweet scent during the night. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by nocturnal insects such as moths. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in hot, dry climates."
