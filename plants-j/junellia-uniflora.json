    "intro": "Junellia uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower junellia, is a perennial herb native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single, showy flower per stem, typically in shades of blue or violet, which bloom during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. Junellia uniflora is often found in wetlands and along the edges of streams, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
