    "intro": "Jacksonago cuspidata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf yucca, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that bears clusters of white or pale blue flowers. The plant has sword-shaped, evergreen leaves that are narrow and pointed, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Jacksonago cuspidata is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
