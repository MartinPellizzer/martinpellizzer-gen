It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white bloom. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
