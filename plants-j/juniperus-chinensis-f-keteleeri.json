    "intro": "Juniperus chinensis f. keteleeri, commonly known as the Chinese juniper or Keteleeri juniper, is a compact, slow-growing evergreen shrub or small tree native to China. It features needle-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, providing a striking visual contrast against its reddish-brown bark. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are often used in ornamental gardening due to their aesthetic appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and as a foundation plant. This variety is prized for its hardiness and ability to maintain its form over time."
