    "intro": "Juncus pilosus, commonly known as the hairy rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of greenish or brownish flowers. Juncus pilosus plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
