    "intro": "Jatropha obtusifolia var. genuina, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its simple, ovate to elliptical leaves that are often pubescent on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that transition to red berries containing toxic seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it adaptable to various arid environments. Its latex contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
