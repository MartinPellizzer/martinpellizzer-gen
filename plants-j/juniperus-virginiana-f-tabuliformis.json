It is characterized by its flattened, scale-like leaves that form dense, compact foliage. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its wood is dense and aromatic, making it valuable for crafting and traditional uses. This form is a natural variant of the common juniper, exhibiting distinct morphological differences in leaf structure."
