    "intro": "Jamesonia robusta, commonly known as the hardy candleberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features dense, dark green foliage that turns reddish-brown in the fall. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sun. Jamesonia robusta is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate shade."
