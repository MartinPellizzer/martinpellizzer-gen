    "intro": "Junellia tridactylites, commonly known as the three-toed junellia, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the family Junellaceae. It is characterized by its unique, three-lobed leaves that resemble the shape of a hand, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually green or yellow, and it produces capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its limited geographic distribution and habitat specificity, Junellia tridactylites is considered a botanically significant and ecologically delicate species."
