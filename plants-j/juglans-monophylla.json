It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its single, large, palmately lobed leaf that gives it its common name. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by edible, walnut-like fruits. The wood of Juglans monophylla is strong and durable, making it valuable for crafting and construction."
