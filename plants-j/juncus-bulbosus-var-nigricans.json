    "intro": "Juncus bulbosus var. nigricans, commonly known as black rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features narrow, dark green to blackish stems that are often densely packed, forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in early summer, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and establish colonies in moist soils. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
