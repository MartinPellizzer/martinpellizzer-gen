    "intro": "Jussiaea declinata, commonly known as the slender water-mint, is a semi-aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, with its leaves often floating on the surface or partially submerged. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are usually lance-shaped. Its flowers are tiny, clustered in spikes, and are typically white or pale blue in color. Jussiaea declinata plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for insects and supporting biodiversity."
