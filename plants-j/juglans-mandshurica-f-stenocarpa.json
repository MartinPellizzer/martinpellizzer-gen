    "intro": "Juglans mandshurica f. stenocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruit Manchurian walnut, is a rare and relict species native to the northeastern regions of China. It is characterized by its small, elongated nuts with a thick, smooth husk that matures in late summer. The plant is a deciduous tree with compound leaves that are alternate and pinnately arranged. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and moderate rainfall. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
