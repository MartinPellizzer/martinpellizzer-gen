    "intro": "Jambosa cauliflora, commonly known as the Natal plum, is a tropical evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, glossy green leaves and produces large, showy flowers that bloom directly on the trunk and branches, a trait known as cauliflorous growth. The plant bears clusters of small, fleshy fruits that are typically yellow or orange when ripe. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruit. The tree is also valued for its ability to provide shade and support biodiversity in its native habitat."
