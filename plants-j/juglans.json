    "intro": "Juglans, commonly known as walnuts, are deciduous trees belonging to the family Juglandaceae. They are characterized by their compound leaves, which are typically odd-pinnate with 15 to 23 leaflets. The trees produce hard, woody fruits called nuts, encased in a spiny husk that splits open when mature. The nuts are rich in oils and are widely used in both culinary and medicinal applications. Juglans species are native to the Northern Hemisphere and are valued for their timber, nuts, and ornamental qualities."
