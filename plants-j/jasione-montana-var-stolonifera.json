    "intro": "Jasione montana var. stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features slender, stoloniferous stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively across rocky and gravelly soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet, typically blooming from June to August. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Jasione montana var. stolonifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in challenging environments."
