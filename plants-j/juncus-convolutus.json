    "intro": "Juncus convolutus, commonly known as twisted rush, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife. Juncus convolutus plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to water filtration and supporting biodiversity."
