It features delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. Jasione minuta thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and grasslands. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and wildflower displays."
