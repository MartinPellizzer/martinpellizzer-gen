It is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are typically dark blue when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for landscaping in arid regions."
