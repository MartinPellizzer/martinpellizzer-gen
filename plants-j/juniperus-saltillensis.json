    "intro": "Juniperus saltillensis, commonly known as the Mexican juniper, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the Mexican states of Jalisco and Nayarit. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage and small, cone-like fruits that mature to a dark blue or black color. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. It is often found in mountainous regions and can reach heights of up to 10 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
