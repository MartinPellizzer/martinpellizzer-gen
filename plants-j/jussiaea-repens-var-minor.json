    "intro": "Jussiaea repens var. minor, commonly known as the creeping jussiaea, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland and marshy environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground and form dense mats. The leaves are typically opposite, ovate to elliptical, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are often borne on short pedicels. This plant is adapted to saturated soils and plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
