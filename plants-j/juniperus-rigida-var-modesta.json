    "intro": "Juniperus rigida var. modesta, commonly known as the dwarf juniper, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring dense, needle-like foliage that is often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spherical blue berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and small mammals. It is well adapted to rocky soils and has a slow growth rate, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a low-maintenance ornamental plant. Its resilience to cold and drought conditions further enhances its suitability for landscaping in arid and high-altitude environments."
