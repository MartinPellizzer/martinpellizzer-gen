    "intro": "Jatropha erythropoda, commonly known as the red-veined jatropha, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its striking red veins on its leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by orange-red, three-lobed capsules containing toxic seeds. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and dry forests. Due to the toxicity of its seeds, it is important to handle the plant with care."
