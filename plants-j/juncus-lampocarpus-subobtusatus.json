    "intro": "Juncus lampocarpus subobtusatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rush, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a compact rosette. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in spikelets along the stem. It thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil and make it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
