    "intro": "Justicia gutierrezii, commonly known as the Mexican flame flower, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which are arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. These flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, especially hummingbirds, due to their bright colors and nectar-rich structure. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners in tropical and subtropical regions."
