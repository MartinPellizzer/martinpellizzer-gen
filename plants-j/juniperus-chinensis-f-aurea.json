    "intro": "Juniperus chinensis f. aurea, commonly known as the golden juniper, is a cultivar of the common juniper that exhibits striking golden foliage. This evergreen shrub or small tree is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that turn a vibrant yellow in the summer. It produces small, blue-black berries that are typically ornamental rather than edible. The plant is highly valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types. It thrives in full sun and is often used in gardens for its year-round visual interest."
