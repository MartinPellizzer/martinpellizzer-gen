    "intro": "Jepsonia heterandra, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Jepsonia heterandra is adapted to survive in harsh conditions, making it an important component of desert ecosystems."
