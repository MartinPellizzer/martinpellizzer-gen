It belongs to the Juncaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage composed of narrow, cylindrical leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands, stream banks, or marshy areas. Its flowering spikes produce small, greenish or brownish flowers that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. This variant is noted for its compact growth habit and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes in water gardens."
