    "intro": "Justicia platysepala, commonly known as the broad-leafed justicia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of showy, tubular flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom from summer to fall. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their bright colors and nectar-rich structure. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
