    "intro": "Jurinea tenuiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal dunes and dry steppe environments. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss, and its flowers are typically white or pale pink, appearing in clusters. It is adapted to withstand harsh conditions, including high salinity and strong winds. Jurinea tenuiloba plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
