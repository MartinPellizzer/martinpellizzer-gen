    "intro": "Juniperus communis var. jackii, commonly known as the Jack's juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that is typically dark green with a bluish tinge. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous areas. This variety is notable for its hardiness and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
