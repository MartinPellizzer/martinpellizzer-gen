    "intro": "Jarava nicorae, commonly known as the Nicora grass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Jarava nicorae is often found in rocky soils and is used in traditional medicine by local communities."
