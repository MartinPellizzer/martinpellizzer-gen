    "intro": "Jatropha laciniosa, commonly known as the laceleaf spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves that give it a distinctive, almost feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in branched inflorescences. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along forest edges. Jatropha laciniosa is also known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation and is a defense mechanism against herbivores."
