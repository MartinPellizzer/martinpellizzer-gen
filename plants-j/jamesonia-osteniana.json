    "intro": "Jamesonia osteniana, commonly known as the mountain onion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high elevations of the western United States. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers in early spring. The plant is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its botanical structure includes a fibrous root system and a short, stout stem that supports its flowering spikes. Jamesonia osteniana is often found in alpine and subalpine meadows, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinators."
