    "intro": "Justicia metallica, commonly known as the silverleaf flameflower, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking, tubular, violet-pink flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant has silver-gray, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil. Justicia metallica is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
