    "intro": "Jatropha paucistaminea, commonly known as the narrow-leaf physic nut, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its milky sap and showy inflorescences. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with alternate, narrow leaves. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, and it produces small, spiny fruits containing toxic seeds. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided as a food plant, though it has been studied for potential medicinal uses."
