    "intro": "Juglans boliviana, commonly known as the Bolivian walnut, is a species of deciduous tree native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the walnut family, Juglandaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and large, edible nuts. The tree can grow up to 20 meters tall and thrives in temperate to subtropical climates. Its bark is thick and rugged, while its fruit develops in a spiny husk that protects the hard-shelled nut inside. The plant is valued for its timber and its nuts, which are rich in oils and nutrients."
