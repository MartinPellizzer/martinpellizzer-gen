    "intro": "Juncus polytrichos, commonly known as the hairy rush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It features tall, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of greenish-white flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist soils. Juncus polytrichos plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
