    "intro": "Johnstonella gypsites, commonly known as the gypsite lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga. It belongs to the family Trapeliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, crust-like growth form. The plant typically grows on rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in regions with low humidity. Its structure consists of a fungal matrix that encases the algal cells, which carry out photosynthesis. Johnstonella gypsites plays a role in soil formation and serves as an indicator species for environmental conditions."
