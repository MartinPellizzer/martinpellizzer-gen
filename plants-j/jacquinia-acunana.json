    "intro": "Jacquinia acunana, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool and moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. Jacquinia acunana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
