    "intro": "Juncus filiformis var. curvatus, commonly known as the curled rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features slender, grass-like leaves that curve downward, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil make it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
