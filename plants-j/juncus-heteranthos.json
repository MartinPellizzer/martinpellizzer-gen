    "intro": "Juncus heteranthos, commonly known as the common rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It features tall, cylindrical stems that are often used in basketry and thatching due to their fibrous texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, stabilizing soil in aquatic habitats. Juncus heteranthos plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
