    "intro": "Juglans laciniosa, commonly known as the Mexican walnut, is a deciduous tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the walnut family, Juglandaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves with lance-shaped leaflets. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by oval, green fruits that mature into dark brown nuts enclosed in a spiky husk. Its bark is thick and fissured, often with a reddish-brown color, and it can grow up to 20 meters tall in its natural habitat. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its edible nuts, though it is less commonly cultivated than other walnut species."
