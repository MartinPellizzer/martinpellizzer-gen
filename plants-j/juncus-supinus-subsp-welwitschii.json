    "intro": "Juncus supinus subsp. welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitsch's rush, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and slender, cylindrical stems that often form compact clumps. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as along riverbanks and in swampy areas. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in spike-like inflorescences, and it produces small, three-lobed seeds. This subspecies is adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils and is often found in humid, temperate climates."
