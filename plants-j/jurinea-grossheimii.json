    "intro": "Jurinea grossheimii, commonly known as the desert sandflower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, hairy leaves adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow or pale green flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-suited to harsh, dry environments. Due to its specialized adaptations, it plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and supporting local biodiversity."
