    "intro": "Juncus fontanesii var. distortus, commonly known as the twisted rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems that often exhibit a twisted or spiraled growth pattern, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically growing in dense clumps. It thrives in moist to waterlogged soils and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds and lakes."
