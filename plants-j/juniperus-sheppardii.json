    "intro": "Juniperus sheppardii, commonly known as the sheppard juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its scale-like leaves and produces small, berry-like cones that are typically blue or purple in color. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species capable of surviving in harsh conditions. It plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species. The wood of Juniperus sheppardii is often used in construction and as a source of aromatic resin."
