    "intro": "Juncus bicornis var. williamsii, commonly known as the Williams' rush, is a variant of the broadleaf rush native to the western United States. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its cylindrical, grass-like stems that grow in dense clusters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slight waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and other moist habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
