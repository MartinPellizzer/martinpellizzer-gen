    "intro": "Juniperus taxifolia, commonly known as the Japanese juniper, is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to Japan and the Korean Peninsula. It is characterized by its aromatic, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color and have a distinct, sharp scent. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are typically blue or black when mature, containing toxic seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas. Juniperus taxifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in horticulture and landscaping."
