    "intro": "Jasminum exsertum, commonly known as the desert jasmine, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, adapting well to dry and hot climates. The plant produces fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, providing some shade in its harsh environment. Jasminum exsertum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
