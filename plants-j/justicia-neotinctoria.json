    "intro": "Justicia neotinctoria, commonly known as the red hot poker or flame flower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom in dense spikes. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their bright colors and nectar-rich structure. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant display."
