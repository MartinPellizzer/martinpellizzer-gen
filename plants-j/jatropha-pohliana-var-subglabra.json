    "intro": "Jatropha pohliana var. subglabra, commonly known as the smooth jatropha, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are smooth and often glabrous, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into capsule fruits containing toxic seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
