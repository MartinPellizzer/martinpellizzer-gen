    "intro": "Jardinia plumosa, commonly known as the silky flame tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its feathery, palmate leaves that give it a distinctive, airy appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late winter or early spring. Jardinia plumosa thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes in suitable climates."
