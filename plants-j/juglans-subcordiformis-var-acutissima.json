    "intro": "Juglans subcordiformis var. acutissima, commonly known as the Acute-leaf Black Walnut, is a variant of the black walnut tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, acute-angled leaves that are typically longer and narrower than those of the typical species. The plant produces large, edible nuts enclosed in a thick, husky outer layer. Its bark is rugged and ridged, often with a dark, almost black appearance. This variety is valued for its hardy nature and potential for nut production in arid and semi-arid environments."
