It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are usually bright red or orange, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it is known for its drought tolerance. The plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
