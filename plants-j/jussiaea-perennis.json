It is characterized by its compact, succulent growth habit and produces clusters of small, blue or violet flowers. The plant has fleshy, silver-gray leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found along shorelines. Jussiaea perennis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
