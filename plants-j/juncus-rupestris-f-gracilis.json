    "intro": "Juncus rupestris f. gracilis, commonly known as the slender rock rush, is a compact, herbaceous plant native to rocky or sandy soils in arid regions. It features upright, cylindrical stems that are typically shorter and more slender than the typical species, with grass-like leaves that are narrow and fibrous. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to drought conditions and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its unique morphology and resilience make it a valuable addition to rock gardens and dryland landscapes."
