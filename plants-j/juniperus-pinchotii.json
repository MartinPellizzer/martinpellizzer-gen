    "intro": "Juniperus pinchotii, commonly known as the eastern red cedar, is a species of juniper native to the eastern United States. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen conifer that typically grows in moist, acidic soils. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for various birds and mammals. Its fragrant wood has been historically used for fence posts and as a source of aromatic oils. The plant plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and stabilizing soil in forested areas."
