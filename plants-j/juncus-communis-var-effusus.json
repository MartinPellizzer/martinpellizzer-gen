    "intro": "Juncus communis var. effusus, commonly known as soft rush, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that forms dense mats or tussocks. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its slender, cylindrical stems are often slightly curved and bear small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The soft rush is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
