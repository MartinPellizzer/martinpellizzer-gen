    "intro": "Juniperus canadensis, commonly known as eastern red cedar, is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, scale-like leaves and produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and small mammals. The plant is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it adaptable to a variety of environmental conditions. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and its ability to provide habitat for wildlife. The wood of Juniperus canadensis is durable and has been historically used for fence posts and other outdoor structures."
