    "intro": "Juanulloa, commonly known as the Brazilian elderberry, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of several species native to South America, particularly Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina. The plants are shrubs or small trees with alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves. They produce small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by berry-like fruits that are edible. The botanical features of Juanulloa make it an important plant in both ecological and traditional contexts."
