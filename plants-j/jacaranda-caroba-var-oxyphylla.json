It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant produces long, slender pods that contain flat, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of multiple small, oval-shaped leaflets. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to warm, sunny climates."
