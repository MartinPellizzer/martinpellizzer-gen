    "intro": "Jatropha sparsifolia, commonly known as the sparsely leafy jatropha, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing toxic seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
