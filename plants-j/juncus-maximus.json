    "intro": "Juncus maximus, commonly known as the tall rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height, often forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes at the top of the stems, typically in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in moist or waterlogged soils. Juncus maximus plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
