    "intro": "Joosia oligantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved joosia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Joosia oligantha is often found in open woodlands and along riverbanks, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
