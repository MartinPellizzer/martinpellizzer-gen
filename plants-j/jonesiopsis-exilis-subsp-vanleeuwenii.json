    "intro": "Jonesiopsis exilis subsp. vanleeuwenii, commonly known as the Van Leeuwen's Jonesiopsis, is a rare and delicate fern native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its slender, arching fronds with finely divided, serrated leaves. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its spores are released from small, clustered sorus structures on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
