    "intro": "Juncoides campestris var. multiflora, commonly known as the common rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its cylindrical, grass-like stems. It typically grows in moist or wet environments such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, three-lobed flowers. Its leaves are narrow, flat, and often have a slight sheathing at the base. This variant is distinguished by its ability to produce multiple flower clusters along its stem, contributing to its ornamental and ecological value."
