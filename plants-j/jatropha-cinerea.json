    "intro": "Jatropha cinerea, commonly known as the silverleaf jatropha, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into spiny, three-chambered capsules containing toxic, orange-red seeds. Jatropha cinerea is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in poor, dry conditions. It is also known for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
