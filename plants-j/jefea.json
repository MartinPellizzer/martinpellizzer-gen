    "intro": "Jefea, commonly known as the desert star, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, waxy, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Jefea is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with minimal rainfall. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers."
