It features dense, scale-like foliage that is typically blue-gray in color, providing a distinctive visual appearance. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are often used in traditional medicine and as a spice in culinary applications. It is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in poor soils and with minimal water requirements. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for landscaping in dry climates."
