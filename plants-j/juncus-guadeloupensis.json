    "intro": "Juncus guadeloupensis, commonly known as Guadeloupe rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe. It belongs to the Juncaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage composed of narrow, cylindrical leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands, marshes, or along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Juncus guadeloupensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms in its native environment."
