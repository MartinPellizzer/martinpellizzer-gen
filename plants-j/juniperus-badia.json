    "intro": "Juniperus badia, commonly known as the Kashmiri juniper, is a species of coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which are typically blue-green in color and arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing at elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
