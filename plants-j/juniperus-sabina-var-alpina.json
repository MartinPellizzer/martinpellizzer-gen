    "intro": "Juniperus sabina var. alpina, commonly known as the Alpine juniper, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, scale-like leaves that are dark green and densely packed, giving it a rugged appearance. The plant produces blue-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Juniperus sabina var. alpina is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to withstand harsh climatic conditions."
