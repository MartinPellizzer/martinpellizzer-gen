    "intro": "Jacquemontia violacea, commonly known as the violet morning glory, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves and produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its climbing habit is supported by tendrils that allow it to ascend structures or other plants. The flowers are pollinated by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological significance in native habitats."
