    "intro": "Justicia prolifera, commonly known as the silver bush or silver leaf plant, is a flowering shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, or white, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its ability to spread via stolons makes it both a resilient and sometimes invasive species in certain environments."
