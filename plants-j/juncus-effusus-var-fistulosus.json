    "intro": "Juncus effusus var. fistulosus, commonly known as the hollow rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its cylindrical, hollow stems that are often mistaken for reeds, growing in dense clusters. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-white flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging from the base of the plant. This species is adapted to moist soils and is often found in marshes, stream banks, and pond edges."
