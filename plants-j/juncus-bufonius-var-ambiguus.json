    "intro": "Juncus bufonius var. ambiguus, commonly known as the ambiguous bulrush, is a wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil along the edges of ponds, lakes, and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and grassy, while its flowers are small and clustered in spikes. This variant is often distinguished by its morphological variability, which can make it challenging to classify."
