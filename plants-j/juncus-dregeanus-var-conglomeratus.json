It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves that form a compact rosette. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along water margins. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and wetland habitats."
