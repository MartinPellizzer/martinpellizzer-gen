    "intro": "Juncus laevis var. effusus, commonly known as the soft rush, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments across much of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its cylindrical, grass-like stems that are typically smooth and slightly hairy, growing in dense clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, which are borne on slender, branching stalks. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. This variety is notable for its adaptability to wet conditions and its role in stabilizing aquatic and riparian ecosystems."
