    "intro": "Juncus cephalostigma var. dingjieensis, commonly known as the Dingjie rush, is a variant of the genus Juncus native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems that grow in dense clusters, typically reaching heights of 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, greenish-white flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
