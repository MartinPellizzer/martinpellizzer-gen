    "intro": "Juncus rariflorus, commonly known as the sparse-flower rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It features slender, grass-like stems that grow in dense clusters, often reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and cylindrical, with a prominent midrib, and are adapted to thrive in water-saturated soils. Juncus rariflorus plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
