    "intro": "Jasonia foetida, commonly known as the stinkwood or African ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and rough, fissured bark that becomes increasingly rugged with age. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making."
