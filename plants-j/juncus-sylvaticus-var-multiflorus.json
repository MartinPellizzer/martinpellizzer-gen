    "intro": "Juncus sylvaticus var. multiflorus, commonly known as the woodland rush, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces spikes of small, greenish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands, stream banks, and wet meadows. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil in riparian areas. The leaves are cylindrical and hollow, with a smooth surface, and the plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits."
