    "intro": "Juncus \u00d7 lancastriensis, commonly known as the Lancashire rush, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Juncus effusus and Juncus tenuis. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wetland environments such as marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. Botanically, it is notable for its adaptability to waterlogged soils and its role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems."
