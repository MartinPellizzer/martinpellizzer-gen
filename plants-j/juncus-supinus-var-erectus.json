    "intro": "Juncus supinus var. erectus, commonly known as the upright rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features tall, grass-like leaves that are typically green to reddish in color, and it produces clusters of small, spike-like flowers during the summer months. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it an important species for wetland restoration. The upright rush is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to support local wildlife."
