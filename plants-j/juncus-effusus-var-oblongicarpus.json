    "intro": "Juncus effusus var. oblongicarpus, commonly known as the broad-fruited rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments. It features tall, cylindrical stems that are usually hairless and can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, followed by oblong, three-angled fruits that are distinctive to this variety. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming dense mats in moist soils. This species is adapted to wet or waterlogged conditions and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams."
