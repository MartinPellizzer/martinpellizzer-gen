It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and slender, cylindrical stems that often grow in clusters. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils, typically found in tundra and alpine environments. Its small, inconspicuous flowers appear in early summer, contributing to its role in local ecosystems. The Tuvinian rush is adapted to cold climates and plays a vital part in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
