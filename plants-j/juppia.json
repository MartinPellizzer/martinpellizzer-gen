It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a compact shrub, often reaching heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Juppia is widely cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and ease of care."
