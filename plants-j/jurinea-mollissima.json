    "intro": "Jurinea mollissima, commonly known as the softleaf sea bladder, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Aizoaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines, often in saline or brackish environments. Its adaptations include a low-growing habit and a thick cuticle to reduce water loss. Jurinea mollissima plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
