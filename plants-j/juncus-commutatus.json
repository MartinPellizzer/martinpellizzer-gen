    "intro": "Juncus commutatus, commonly known as the common rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a cylindrical stem. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and roadside ditches. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in spike-like inflorescences, and it reproduces through seeds and rhizomes. Juncus commutatus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
