    "intro": "Juncus phaeocephalus var. paniculatus, commonly known as the black-headed rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features dense, grass-like foliage with dark, almost black, flowering heads that contrast sharply with its green stems. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often in marshes, swamps, or along the edges of ponds. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, are composed of numerous small, spikelet-like flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
