    "intro": "Jupunba brachystachya, commonly known as the dwarf hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the alpine regions of South America. It features fine, soft, silver-gray blades that form dense, mat-like growths, often carpeting rocky slopes and meadows. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to withstand harsh mountain conditions. Jupunba brachystachya is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems."
