    "intro": "Juglans regia subsp. fallax, commonly known as the Persian walnut, is a subspecies of the black walnut native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its large, elongated leaves with a serrated margin and its distinctive, edible, walnut-shaped fruits. The tree produces compound fruits that split open to reveal the hard-shelled nuts inside. Its wood is highly valued for its strength and fine grain, making it suitable for furniture and cabinetry. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for both its nuts and timber."
