    "intro": "Juncus torreyi var. globularis, commonly known as the globular rush, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of grass-like leaves, which give it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and wetlands. Its foliage is usually bright green, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
