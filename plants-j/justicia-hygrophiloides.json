    "intro": "Justicia hygrophiloides, commonly known as the waterleaf or swamp justicia, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist or wet environments, such as marshes and riverbanks, due to its preference for high humidity and well-drained soils. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, enhancing its ability to retain moisture. Its showy, tubular flowers are usually blue or purple and bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant's adaptability to wet conditions makes it a valuable addition to water gardens and wetland restoration projects."
