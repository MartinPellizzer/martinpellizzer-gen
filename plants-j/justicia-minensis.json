    "intro": "Justicia minensis, commonly known as the Mexican flame flower, is a tropical shrub native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is characterized by its striking, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant has opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Justicia minensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
