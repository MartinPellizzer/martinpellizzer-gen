    "intro": "Juniperus chinensis var. corneyanus, commonly known as the Chinese juniper or Cornelian juniper, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage that is typically dark green, with a slightly bluish tint. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and as a foundation plant in landscapes. Its compact size and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for horticultural use in temperate climates."
