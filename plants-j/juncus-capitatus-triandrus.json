    "intro": "Juncus capitatus triandrus, commonly known as the clustered rush, is a perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves that form a compact rosette. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in a spike at the top of the stems, which are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in wet or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Juncus capitatus triandrus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
