    "intro": "Jatropha variabilis, commonly known as the variable jatropha, is a shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves that vary in shape and size. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing toxic, orange seeds. It is adapted to grow in a variety of soil types and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
