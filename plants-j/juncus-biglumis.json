    "intro": "Juncus biglumis, commonly known as the two-flowered rush, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Juncaceae and is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or brown, arranged in two rows along the stem. Juncus biglumis thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and pond edges. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it ecologically important in wetland ecosystems."
