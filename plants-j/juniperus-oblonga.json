    "intro": "Juniperus oblonga, commonly known as the dwarf juniper, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It typically reaches a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, needle-like foliage that is dark green in color. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and small mammals. Juniperus oblonga is well adapted to harsh, rocky environments and thrives in full sun with well-drained soil. Its compact size and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
