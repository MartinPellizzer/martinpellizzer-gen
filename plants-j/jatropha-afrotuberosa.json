It is characterized by its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds, and its simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by orange or red capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. Jatropha afrotuberosa is also known for its potential as a source of biofuel due to its ability to produce oil-rich seeds."
