    "intro": "Juncus pyrenaeus, commonly known as the Pyrenean rush, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish flowers in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in mountain streams and wetlands. It has a compact growth habit and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Juncus pyrenaeus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
