    "intro": "Justicia gambleana, commonly known as the golden trumpet vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking clusters of orange-yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in well-drained soils, while its stems are often woody and can develop thorns. The plant is also notable for its ability to attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees."
