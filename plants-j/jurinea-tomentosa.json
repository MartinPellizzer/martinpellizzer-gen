    "intro": "Jurinea tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly sea bladder, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh maritime environment. Jurinea tomentosa is well adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient species in coastal ecosystems."
