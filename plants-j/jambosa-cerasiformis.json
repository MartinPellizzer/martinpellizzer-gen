It is characterized by its distinctive five-pointed star-shaped fruit, which turns yellow when ripe. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a glossy surface. The fruit is valued not only for its flavor but also for its nutritional content, including vitamin C and antioxidants."
