    "intro": "Justicia eburnea, commonly known as the silverleaf justicia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage and clusters of showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure."
