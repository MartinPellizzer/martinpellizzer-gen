    "intro": "Jovibarba globifera subsp. allionii, commonly known as the Allion's cushion plant, is a low-growing, mat-forming succulent native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features dense clusters of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color, covered in a fine layer of white wool. The plant produces small, pale yellow to greenish flowers on short stalks during the spring and early summer. It is adapted to rocky and alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many areas."
