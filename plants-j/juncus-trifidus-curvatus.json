It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems that are often curved or arched, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as pond edges and damp meadows, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soil. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, with a fibrous texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. This plant plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
