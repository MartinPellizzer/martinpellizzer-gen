    "intro": "Juncus kotschyi, commonly known as the Kotschyi rush, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and cylindrical, spike-like inflorescence that bears small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, often colonizing disturbed or marginal habitats. Juncus kotschyi plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small invertebrates."
