It is characterized by its striking foliage, featuring leaves with deep green veins contrasting against a lighter green or yellow background. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.
