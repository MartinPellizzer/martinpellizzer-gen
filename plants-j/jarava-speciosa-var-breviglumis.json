    "intro": "Jarava speciosa var. breviglumis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved jarava, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats or tufts. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its inflorescence consists of small, spike-like clusters of pale blue to purple flowers, which appear in late spring to early summer. This variety is often found in coastal dunes, grasslands, and other disturbed habitats, contributing to soil stabilization and ecological diversity."
