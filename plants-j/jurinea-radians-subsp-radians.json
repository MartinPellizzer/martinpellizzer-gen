    "intro": "Jurinea radians subsp. radians, commonly known as the coastal bellflower, is a perennial herb native to arid and coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its low, mat-forming growth habit and features small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has succulent leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky outcrops. Its blooming period typically occurs in spring, adding a delicate floral display to its harsh habitat."
