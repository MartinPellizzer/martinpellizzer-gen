It is characterized by its striking clusters of violet-blue flowers that appear in late winter to early spring. The leaves are bipinnate, with small, pointed leaflets that give the plant its species name \"acutifolia.\" The varietal name \"punctata\" refers to the distinctive spots on the leaves, which are often a lighter green or white.
