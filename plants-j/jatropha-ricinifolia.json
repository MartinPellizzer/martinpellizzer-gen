    "intro": "Jatropha ricinifolia, commonly known as the poisonwood tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into toxic, orange-red berries. The plant contains ricin, a potent toxin found in its seeds, making it highly dangerous if ingested. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Jatropha ricinifolia is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a resilient species in tropical ecosystems."
