    "intro": "Jasione perennis var. humilis, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming habit with numerous stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, often with a bluish-green hue. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, rocky areas, and along woodland edges."
