    "intro": "Jaumea angolensis, commonly known as the Angolan grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or inland dune environments. The plant features a tufted growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. Jaumea angolensis is adapted to arid or semi-arid conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
