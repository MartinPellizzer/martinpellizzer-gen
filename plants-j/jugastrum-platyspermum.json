It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves and smooth, gray bark. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by fleshy, orange-red fruits containing several seeds. Its seeds are enclosed in a thick, fleshy pulp, which is a key feature of the species. Jugastrum platyspermum is often found in tropical lowland forests and is valued for its ornamental and potential medicinal properties."
