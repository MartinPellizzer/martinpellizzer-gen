    "intro": "Juncus articulatus subsp. nigritellus, commonly known as black-stemmed rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. The plant has cylindrical, jointed stems that are usually dark green to black in color, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
