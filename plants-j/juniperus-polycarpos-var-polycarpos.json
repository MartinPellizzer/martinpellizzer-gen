    "intro": "Juniperus polycarpos var. polycarpos, commonly known as the smooth juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Juniperus polycarpos var. polycarpos is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
