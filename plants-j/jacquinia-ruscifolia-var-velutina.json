    "intro": "Jacquinia ruscifolia var. velutina, commonly known as velvetleaf jacquinia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features small, ovate to elliptic leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which are often hidden among the foliage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fibrous root system and succulent stems make it adaptable to a variety of wetland habitats."
