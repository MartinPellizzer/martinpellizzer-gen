    "intro": "Jupunba abbottii, commonly known as the Abbott's jupunba, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and prefers well-drained, loamy soils. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, while its small, white flowers bloom in late spring. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Jupunba abbottii is considered an endangered species."
