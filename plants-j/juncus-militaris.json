    "intro": "Juncus militaris, commonly known as the military rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It typically grows in dense clusters, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with slender, grass-like leaves that are often used in basket-making. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland habitats. Juncus militaris is an important component of aquatic ecosystems, providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
