    "intro": "Juncus engleri, commonly known as the Engler's rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and swampy areas. The plant features tall, cylindrical stems that are often leafless above the base, with narrow, grass-like leaves near the base. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, greenish or brownish flowers that are wind-pollinated. Juncus engleri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
