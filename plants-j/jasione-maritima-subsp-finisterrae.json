    "intro": "Jasione maritima subsp. finisterrae, commonly known as the Atlantic Jasione, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the coastal regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shores, often in areas exposed to salt spray and strong winds. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh coastal environment. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
