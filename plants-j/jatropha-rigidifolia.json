    "intro": "Jatropha rigidifolia, commonly known as the rigidleaf spurge, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often rigid and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by spiny capsules containing toxic seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
