It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands, stream banks, and wet meadows. The plant features tall, cylindrical stems that are segmented and often have a reddish or brownish hue. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in late spring to early summer.
