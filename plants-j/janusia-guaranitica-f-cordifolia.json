    "intro": "Janusia guaranitica f. cordifolia, commonly known as the heart-leaf fern, is a rare fern species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its fronds are leathery and have a deep green color, with a unique arrangement of pinnae that distinguish it from other fern species. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
