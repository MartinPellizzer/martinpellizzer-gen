    "intro": "Jatropha humilis, commonly known as the dwarf physic nut, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches a height of less than 1 meter. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing toxic seeds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Jatropha humilis is known for its ornamental value and has been studied for potential use in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals from soil."
