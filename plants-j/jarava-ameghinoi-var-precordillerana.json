    "intro": "Jarava ameghinoi var. precordillerana, commonly known as the Andean jarava, is a perennial grass species native to the high Andes of South America. It typically grows in rocky, arid environments at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 4,000 meters. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures. Its inflorescence consists of compact, spike-like clusters of small, pale green to brown flowers. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in mountainous regions and for its use in traditional practices by local communities."
