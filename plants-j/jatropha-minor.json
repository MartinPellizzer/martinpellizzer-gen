It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by green, fleshy capsules that turn red when mature. Its sap contains toxic compounds, making it a potential hazard to livestock and humans. Jatropha minor is often found in disturbed soils and is used in some traditional medicinal practices."
