    "intro": "Juncus sylvaticus var. brevirostris, commonly known as the short-beaked rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in Europe. It features tall, cylindrical stems that are typically green to reddish in color, often growing in dense clusters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, arising from a basal rosette, and are adapted for water retention. This variety is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wetland wildlife."
