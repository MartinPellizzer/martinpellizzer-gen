    "intro": "Jurinea paczoskiana, commonly known as the Pacific coast sandplant, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of western North America. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy and gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Jurinea paczoskiana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
