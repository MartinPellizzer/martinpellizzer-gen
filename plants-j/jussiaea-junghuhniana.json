    "intro": "Jussiaea junghuhniana, commonly known as the slender water-plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in spikes and bloom during the warmer months. Jussiaea junghuhniana plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
