    "intro": "Juncus inflexus var. proliferus, commonly known as the spreading rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically green and cylindrical in shape. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of pale green to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. This variant is distinguished by its more extensive branching and dense growth habit compared to other juncus species."
