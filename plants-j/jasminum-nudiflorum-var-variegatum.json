    "intro": "Jasminum nudiflorum var. variegatum, commonly known as the variegated winter jasmine, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It is characterized by its striking variegated leaves that display shades of white, yellow, and green. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens. Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and its delicate, early-blooming flowers."
