    "intro": "Juniperus morrisonicola, commonly known as Morrison's juniper, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the mountainous regions of central China. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in forested or alpine environments. The plant features scale-like leaves that are dense and arranged in compact clusters, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its cones, which are small and berry-like, are an important food source for various wildlife species. Juniperus morrisonicola is valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for ornamental purposes."
