    "intro": "Juncus marginatus var. vulgaris, commonly known as the common rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments across Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in dense clusters, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often reddish at the base. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in spike-like inflorescences, which are usually borne on tall, slender stems. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil make it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
