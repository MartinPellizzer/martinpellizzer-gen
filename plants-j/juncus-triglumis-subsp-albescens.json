    "intro": "Juncus triglumis subsp. albescens, commonly known as the white-tipped rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale green to white flowers in dense clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in suitable habitats. The subspecies is distinguished by its pale floral bracts, which give it its common name."
