It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies, sunflowers, and similar plants. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, such as the Andes, where it thrives in cooler, temperate climates. It features small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, surrounded by bracts that resemble petals. The leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, adapted to the harsh conditions of its natural habitat."
