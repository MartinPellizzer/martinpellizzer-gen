    "intro": "Jungia polita var. divaricata, commonly known as the slender jungle fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant features a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are typically bright green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in humid environments. It thrives in shaded, moist conditions and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks."
