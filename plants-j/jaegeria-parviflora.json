    "intro": "Jaegeria parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered jaegeria, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its small, pale yellow to white flowers bloom in late summer, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits called cypselae. Jaegeria parviflora is often used in ornamental gardening for its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in partial shade."
