    "intro": "Jarava ichu var. pungens, commonly known as the hairy jarava, is a perennial grass native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and dense, compact growth habit. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce wind-pollinated flowers, typical of grasses. It plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
