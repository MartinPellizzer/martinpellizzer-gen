    "intro": "Juniperus horizontalis subsp. neopangaea, commonly known as the African sandmat, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and scale-like leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are typically blue or black when mature. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The botanical features of this subspecies make it an attractive ornamental plant in arid and semi-arid environments."
