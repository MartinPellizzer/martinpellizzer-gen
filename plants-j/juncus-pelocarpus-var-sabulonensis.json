    "intro": "Juncus pelocarpus var. sabulonensis, commonly known as the sand junco, is a perennial grass-like plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments or along shorelines. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of white or pale green flowers. It is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate periodic flooding, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems. Its fibrous roots help stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion."
