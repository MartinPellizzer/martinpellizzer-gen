    "intro": "Juniperus media, commonly known as the common juniper, is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color and its clustered, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. The plant produces aromatic wood that has been historically used for construction and as a source of turpentine. Its adaptability to various soil types and climates allows it to thrive in a range of environments, from coastal areas to mountainous regions. Juniperus media plays an important ecological role in supporting biodiversity and stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
