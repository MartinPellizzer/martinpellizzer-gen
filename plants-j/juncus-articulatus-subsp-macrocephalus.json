    "intro": "Juncus articulatus subsp. macrocephalus, commonly known as the large-headed rush, is a perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features tall, cylindrical stems that are often reddish-brown in color, and it produces dense clusters of small, pale green to brown flowers at the tips of its stems. The plant has jointed stems, a characteristic feature of the Juncaceae family, which allows it to withstand waterlogged conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically growing in tufts at the base of the plant. This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms."
