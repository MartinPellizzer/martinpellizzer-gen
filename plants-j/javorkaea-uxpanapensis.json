    "intro": "Javorkaea uxpanapensis, commonly known as the Mexican morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its trumpet-shaped, showy flowers that typically bloom in the morning. The plant is a vigorous climber with heart-shaped leaves and produces seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded areas in the wild. Javorkaea uxpanapensis is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
