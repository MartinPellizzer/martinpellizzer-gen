The leaves are typically divided into several narrow, elongated segments, giving the plant a unique appearance. This form is a natural variant that occurs in certain regions of the eastern United States. The tree produces edible nuts enclosed in a hard, green shell, which are valued for their flavor and oil content. It is adapted to a variety of soil types but thrives in well-drained, fertile ground."
