    "intro": "Juglans regia pendula, commonly known as the weeping walnut, is a cultivar of the Persian walnut tree. It is characterized by its pendulous branches that droop gracefully, creating a distinctive cascading appearance. The tree produces large, green, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its fruit is a tough, spiky husk enclosing a hard, edible nut. This ornamental tree is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often planted in gardens and parks."
