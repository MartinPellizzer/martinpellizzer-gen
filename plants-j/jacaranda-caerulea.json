It is characterized by its striking clusters of violet-blue flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Its wood is valued for its durability and is used in furniture and construction. The tree also produces small, round pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
