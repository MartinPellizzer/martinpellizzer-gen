    "intro": "Juncellus calanthus, commonly known as the golden rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks, wet meadows, and woodland edges. The plant features slender, grass-like stems that are often tinged with yellow or golden hues, especially at the tips. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish-white and arranged in dense clusters. Juncellus calanthus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
