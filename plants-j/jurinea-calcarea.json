    "intro": "Jurinea calcarea, commonly known as the limestone sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils, often found on rocky or sandy substrates. Its ability to survive in harsh conditions makes it an important component of desert ecosystems. Jurinea calcarea plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
