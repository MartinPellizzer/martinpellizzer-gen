    "intro": "Jacquinia stenophylloides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf jacquinia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments. Its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish flowers make it an attractive yet understated wildflower. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
