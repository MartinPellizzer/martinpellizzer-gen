    "intro": "Juniperus sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the globe juniper, is a species of shrub or small tree native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spherical or globular growth habit, with dense, scale-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are typically dark blue to black when mature, containing toxic seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. Juniperus sphaerocarpa is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and drought tolerance."
