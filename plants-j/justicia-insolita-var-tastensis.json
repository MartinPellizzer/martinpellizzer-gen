It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep red to orange, often attracting hummingbirds and other pollinators. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
