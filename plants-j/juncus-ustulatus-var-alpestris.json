    "intro": "Juncus ustulatus var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine rush, is a perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems that grow in dense tufts, often forming mats on rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra habitats. Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it an important component of mountain ecosystems."
