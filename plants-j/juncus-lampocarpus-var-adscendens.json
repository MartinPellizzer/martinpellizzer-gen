    "intro": "Juncus lampocarpus var. adscendens, commonly known as the ascending bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves that grow in wetland or brackish environments. The plant typically reaches heights of 1 to 3 meters and has a fibrous root system adapted to tolerate saline conditions. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in spikes, and it plays a role in stabilizing shorelines. This variety is often found in tidal marshes and is an important component of coastal wetland ecosystems."
