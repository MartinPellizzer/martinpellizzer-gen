    "intro": "Juncus occidentalis, commonly known as western rush, is a perennial plant native to western North America. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form dense clumps, and it produces tall, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, greenish-white flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize disturbed or unstable soils. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
