It features dense, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, providing a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are edible and often used in culinary applications. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact form and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for landscaping in arid climates."
