    "intro": "Jurinea ancistrophylla, commonly known as the narrowleaf sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has narrow, silvery-gray leaves that are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong winds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. Jurinea ancistrophylla is often found in maritime environments where it plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems."
