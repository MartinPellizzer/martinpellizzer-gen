    "intro": "Juncus bufonius var. parvulus, commonly known as the dwarf bulrush, is a compact, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often forming dense stands along the edges of ponds, lakes, and wet meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 cm in height, contributing to its overall dwarf stature. Its inflorescence consists of small, spike-like clusters of greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions and its role in stabilizing shoreline vegetation."
