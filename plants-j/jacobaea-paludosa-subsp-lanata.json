    "intro": "Jacobaea paludosa subsp. lanata, commonly known as the woolly marsh fleabane, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its subspecies name, *lanata*, refers to the lanate (woolly) texture of its foliage. This plant plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest in ecological restoration projects."
