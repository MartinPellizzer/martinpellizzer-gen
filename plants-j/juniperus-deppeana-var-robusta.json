    "intro": "Juniperus deppeana var. robusta, commonly known as the Mexican red cedar, is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, scaly foliage that is typically a deep blue-green color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. The wood of this species is highly valued for its durability and aromatic properties."
