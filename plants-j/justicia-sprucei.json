    "intro": "Justicia sprucei, commonly known as the purple mistflower, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of the Caribbean. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that resemble clouds of mist. The plant produces vibrant purple to pink bracts that surround small, tubular flowers, which are pollinated by birds and insects. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to semi-shaded environments. Justicia sprucei is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
