    "intro": "Jussiaea variabilis var. affinis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water primrose, is a semi-aquatic plant native to wetland areas in South America. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, with its leaves floating on the surface or submerged. The plant has elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. Its small, white flowers bloom in clusters, adding ornamental value to aquatic gardens. It is often used in water gardens and ponds for its aesthetic appeal and ability to help control algae growth."
