    "intro": "Jaegeria glabra var. nana, commonly known as dwarf jaegeria, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in the summer, which are borne on short, erect stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded woodland environments. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for ground cover in gardens and naturalized areas."
