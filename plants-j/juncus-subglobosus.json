    "intro": "Juncus subglobosus, commonly known as the globular rush, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of grass-like leaves that form a compact, rounded shape. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring. Juncus subglobosus plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
