    "intro": "Juncus arcticus var. gracilis, commonly known as slender arctic rush, is a flowering plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is a perennial grass-like plant characterized by its narrow, cylindrical stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its leaves are grass-like and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
