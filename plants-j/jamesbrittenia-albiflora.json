It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive floral structures. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the warmer months. Its root system is adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation, benefiting the surrounding ecosystem. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
