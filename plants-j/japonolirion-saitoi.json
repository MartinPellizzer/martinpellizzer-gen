It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers partial to full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
