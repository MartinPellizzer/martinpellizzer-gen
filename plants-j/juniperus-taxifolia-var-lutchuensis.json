    "intro": "Juniperus taxifolia var. lutchuensis, commonly known as the Lutchu juniper, is a rare variant of the Japanese juniper. It is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree characterized by its needle-like leaves and compact growth habit. The plant is native to the island of Lutchu (Luzon) in the Philippines and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. It produces small, blue-gray berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
