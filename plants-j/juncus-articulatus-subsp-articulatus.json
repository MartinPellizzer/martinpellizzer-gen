    "intro": "Juncus articulatus subsp. articulatus, commonly known as the common rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves. It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as along stream banks, ditches, and in shallow water. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize new areas. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in a spike-like inflorescence, and are pollinated by wind. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
