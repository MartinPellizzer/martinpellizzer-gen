    "intro": "Jovellana sinclairii, commonly known as the Sinclair's everlet, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty highlands of New Zealand. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom during the late spring and early summer. Its leaves are evergreen, leathery, and arranged in a dense, compact formation. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Jovellana sinclairii is considered a vulnerable species."
