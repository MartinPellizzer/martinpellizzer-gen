    "intro": "Juglans alba ovata, commonly known as the whitebark walnut, is a species of walnut native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its rough, fissured bark and compound leaves with 15-23 leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by oval, green fruits that mature into hard, woody nuts. Its seeds are encased in a thick, bitter husk and are an important food source for various wildlife species."
