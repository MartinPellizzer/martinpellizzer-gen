It is characterized by its vibrant red bracts that surround its small, white flowers, creating a dramatic visual display. The plant has opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often asymmetrical, giving it its common name. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Justicia inaequifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
