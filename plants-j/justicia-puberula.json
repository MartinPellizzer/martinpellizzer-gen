    "intro": "Justicia puberula, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf false arum, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue or purple flowers that are typically arranged in spikes, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain areas."
