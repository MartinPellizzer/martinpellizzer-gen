It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are typically hollow and covered in fine, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of white or pale green flowers at the top of the stems. It thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. Juncus persicus is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in aquatic habitats."
