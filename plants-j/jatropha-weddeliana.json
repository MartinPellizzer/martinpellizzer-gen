    "intro": "Jatropha weddeliana, commonly known as the Antarctic jatropha, is a flowering plant native to the southern regions of South America. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to harsh, cold climates. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing toxic seeds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Jatropha weddeliana is notable for its resilience in extreme environments, making it a subject of interest in ecological studies."
