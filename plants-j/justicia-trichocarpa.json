    "intro": "Justicia trichocarpa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or purple velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces striking clusters of tubular, purple to pink flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in many areas."
