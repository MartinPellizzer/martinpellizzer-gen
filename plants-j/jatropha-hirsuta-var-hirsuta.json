    "intro": "Jatropha hirsuta var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy jatropha, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features upright stems covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by spiny, capsule-like fruits containing toxic seeds. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a slightly serrated margin. This species is known for its ornamental value and has been studied for its potential in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals from the soil."
