    "intro": "Juniperus argaea, commonly known as the Armenian juniper, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the Caucasus region. It typically grows in rocky, mountainous areas and has needle-like leaves that are blue-green in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are dark blue when mature, containing toxic seeds. It is well adapted to harsh, arid environments and has a slow growth rate. Juniperus argaea is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
