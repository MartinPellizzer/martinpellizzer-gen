    "intro": "Joniris longispatha, commonly known as the long-spurred orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from violet to deep purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are often clustered in loose inflorescences. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Joniris longispatha is considered a rare and endangered species."
