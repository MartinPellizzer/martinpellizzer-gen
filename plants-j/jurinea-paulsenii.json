    "intro": "Jurinea paulsenii, commonly known as the coastal sandflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in dune environments where it is exposed to strong winds and salt spray. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically yellow or white, appearing in clusters and blooming during the cooler months. Jurinea paulsenii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small organisms."
