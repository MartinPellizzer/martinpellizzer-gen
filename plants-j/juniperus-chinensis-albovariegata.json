    "intro": "Juniperus chinensis albovariegata, commonly known as the Variegated Chinese Juniper, is a compact, slow-growing shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage that displays striking variegation, with white or yellow edges contrasting against deep green centers. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are typically harvested in the fall, though they are not edible for humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a foundation plant in landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its year-round interest and adaptability to various climates."
