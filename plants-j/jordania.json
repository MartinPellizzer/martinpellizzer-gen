    "intro": "Jordania, commonly known as the common spurge, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds and can cause skin irritation. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, with alternate leaves that are often lobed or deeply divided. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium. Jordania is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats."
