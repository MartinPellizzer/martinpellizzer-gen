    "intro": "Juniperus virginiana humilis, commonly known as the eastern redcedar or small-leaf juniper, is a low-growing shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its scale-like leaves that are typically reddish-brown, and its small, berry-like cones that are toxic to livestock. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and prairies. It is also notable for its fragrant foliage and its ability to produce a distinctive wood used in construction and furniture. Juniperus virginiana humilis plays an important role in ecological systems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
