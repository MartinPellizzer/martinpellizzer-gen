    "intro": "Juniperus chinensis var. arenaria, commonly known as the sand juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are often used in traditional medicine and as a spice. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for rocky or sandy landscapes. Its compact growth habit and hardy nature make it a popular choice for landscaping in xeriscaped gardens."
