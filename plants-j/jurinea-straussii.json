    "intro": "Jurinea straussii, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial with a mat-forming habit, characterized by its dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in dune environments and along the coastlines. Its leaves are typically fleshy and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Jurinea straussii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various insect species."
