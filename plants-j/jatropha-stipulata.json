    "intro": "Jatropha stipulata, commonly known as the stipulate croton, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves and yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain toxic seeds, which are a defense mechanism against herbivores. Jatropha stipulata is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along riverbanks. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some regions for garden use."
