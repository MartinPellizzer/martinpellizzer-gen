    "intro": "Juncus campestris var. pallescens, commonly known as the pale rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in marshes, stream banks, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. The plant has slender, hollow stems that are usually pale green to bluish-gray in color, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
