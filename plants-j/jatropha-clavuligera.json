It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into capsule fruits containing toxic seeds. Jatropha clavuligera is part of the Euphorbiaceae family, known for its latex-producing species. Due to the toxicity of its seeds, it is often considered a weed and requires caution during handling."
