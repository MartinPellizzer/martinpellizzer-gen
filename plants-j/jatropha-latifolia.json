    "intro": "Jatropha latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf jatropha, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is often found in moist, shady areas and can grow as a shrub or small tree. Its seeds are encased in a fleshy, orange-red capsule, which splits open to release the seeds. Jatropha latifolia is also noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
