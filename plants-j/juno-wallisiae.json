    "intro": "Juno wallisiae, commonly known as the wallisian lily, is a striking flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silvery hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. Juno wallisiae thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Due to its beauty and rarity, it is a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike."
