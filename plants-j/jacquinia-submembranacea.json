It is a member of the Campanulaceae family, characterized by its bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers are usually blue to violet in color and bloom in the summer months."
