    "intro": "Justicia californica var. conferta, commonly known as the California flameflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, tubular, bright red to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators like hummingbirds and bees."
