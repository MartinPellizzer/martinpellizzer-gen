    "intro": "Juncoides campestris var. longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered rush, is a perennial plant belonging to the Juncaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and clusters of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, ditches, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slight sheen, and it produces numerous small, three-lobed flowers arranged in dense spikes. This variety is notable for its adaptability to wetland habitats and its role in stabilizing soil in such environments."
