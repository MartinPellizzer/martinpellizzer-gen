    "intro": "Juniperus californica f. lutheyana, commonly known as the coastal juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal areas of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces blue-black berries that are edible for birds and small mammals, contributing to its ecological role. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with salt spray and strong winds. This variety is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
