    "intro": "Jasione humilis subsp. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly bellflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in the summer months. The plant has a mat-forming habit with hairy, glandular leaves that give it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open woodlands. Its subspecies distinction is based on its dense pubescence and specific geographic distribution."
