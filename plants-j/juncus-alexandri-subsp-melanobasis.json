It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swamps, and stream banks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are usually dark brown to black in color, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of greenish or brownish flowers. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
