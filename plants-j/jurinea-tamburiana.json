    "intro": "Jurinea tamburiana, commonly known as the desert sandflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid regions of Central Asia. It features small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adapted to withstand harsh desert conditions. The plant has a deep root system to access water from underground sources, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss through transpiration. Jurinea tamburiana plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert insects."
