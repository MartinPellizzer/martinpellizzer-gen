    "intro": "Jurinea brassicifolia, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a cushion-like growth form, adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, typically arranged in dense clusters. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss. Jurinea brassicifolia is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is characteristic of coastal and inland dunes."
