    "intro": "Juncus prismatocarpus subvar. unitubulosus, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Juncaceae family and is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems that are often ribbed or grooved. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often growing in dense clumps near water bodies or in moist, shaded environments. This subvariety is distinguished by its unique tubular floral structure, which sets it apart from other members of the species."
