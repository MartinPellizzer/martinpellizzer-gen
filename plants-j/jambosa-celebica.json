    "intro": "Jambosa celebica, commonly known as the Celebes jambul, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and glossy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that develop into hard, smooth fruits resembling cherries. The fruit's outer skin is thin and turns from green to yellow or red when mature, while the pulp is juicy and has a tart, acidic flavor. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its edible fruit in its native regions."
