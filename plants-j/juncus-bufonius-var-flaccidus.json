    "intro": "Juncus bufonius var. flaccidus, commonly known as the flaccid bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features grass-like, narrow leaves that are typically bluish-green in color and can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms."
