    "intro": "Justicia turipachensis, commonly known as the Andean flame flower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in Peru and Bolivia. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by hummingbirds, which are attracted to its bright colors and nectar-rich structure. The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
