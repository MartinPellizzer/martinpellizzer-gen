    "intro": "Jatropha urens var. neglecta, commonly known as the stinkweed or Indian lettuce, is a herbaceous annual plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant contains toxic compounds, including cardiac glycosides, which can be harmful if ingested. It often grows in disturbed soils and is commonly found in agricultural areas and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions make it an invasive species in some regions."
