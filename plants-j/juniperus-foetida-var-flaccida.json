    "intro": "Juniperus foetida var. flaccida, commonly known as the flaccid juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its grayish-green foliage, which is often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. The leaves are aromatic, releasing a pine-like scent when crushed, which is a common trait among many juniper species."
