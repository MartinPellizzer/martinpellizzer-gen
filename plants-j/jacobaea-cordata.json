    "intro": "Jacobaea cordata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ragwort, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often tinged with reddish or purple hues. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, wastelands, and along roadsides. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
