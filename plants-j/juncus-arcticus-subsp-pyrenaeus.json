    "intro": "Juncus arcticus subsp. pyrenaeus, commonly known as the Pyrenean rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in moist, rocky or alpine habitats, often found in subarctic and arctic environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to cold climates and can survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
