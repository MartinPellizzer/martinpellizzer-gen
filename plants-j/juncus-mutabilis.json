    "intro": "Juncus mutabilis, commonly known as the variable rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America. It features tall, slender cylindrical stems that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in dense clusters at the top of the stems, which are often surrounded by bracts. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, growing in dense tufts at the base. Juncus mutabilis is well adapted to moist soils and plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
