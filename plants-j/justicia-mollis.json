    "intro": "Justicia mollis, commonly known as velvetleaf or Mexican verbena, is a tropical perennial plant native to Central and South America. It features showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in summer. The plant has heart-shaped, velvety leaves that give it its common name, and it thrives in warm, humid climates. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and can be propagated through seeds or cuttings. Its rapid growth and ability to spread make it both a desirable ornamental and a potential weed in some regions."
