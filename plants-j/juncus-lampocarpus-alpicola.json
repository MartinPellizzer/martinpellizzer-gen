    "intro": "Juncus lampocarpus alpicola, commonly known as the alpine rush, is a perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale green flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
