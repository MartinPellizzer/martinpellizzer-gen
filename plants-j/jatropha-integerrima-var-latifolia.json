    "intro": "Jatropha integerrima var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf physic nut, is a species of flowering plant in the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces toxic, milky sap that can cause skin irritation, and its seeds are encased in a hard, spiky capsule. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in arid or semi-arid environments. Despite its toxic properties, it has been studied for its potential use in biofuel production."
