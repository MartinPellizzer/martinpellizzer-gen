    "intro": "Justicia sarothroides, commonly known as the flame flower, is a tropical shrub native to Central America and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its striking, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant has opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, silky hair. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for warm, humid climates. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which can last several months during the growing season."
