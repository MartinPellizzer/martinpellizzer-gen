    "intro": "Juncus gerardi subsp. gerardi, commonly known as the tall rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has long, cylindrical stems that are usually green or reddish in color, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. The plant is also a valuable food source for various wildlife species."
