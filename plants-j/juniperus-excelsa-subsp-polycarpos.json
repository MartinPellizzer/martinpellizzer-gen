It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of scale-like leaves arranged in compact clusters. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. The subspecies is distinguished by its more robust growth and broader leaves compared to other juniper species."
