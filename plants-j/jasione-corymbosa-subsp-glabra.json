    "intro": "Jasione corymbosa subsp. glabra, commonly known as the smooth jasione, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The subspecies glabra is distinguished by its smooth, hairless leaves and stems, which set it apart from other subspecies of Jasione corymbosa. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. This plant is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
