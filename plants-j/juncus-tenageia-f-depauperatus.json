    "intro": "Juncus tenageia f. depauperatus, commonly known as the sparse junegrass, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves. It belongs to the Juncaceae family and is native to certain regions of South America. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. Its foliage is usually a dull green, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring. This variety is noted for its reduced foliage compared to the typical form of Juncus tenageia."
