    "intro": "Jamesonia imbricata var. culebriliensis, commonly known as the Culebra Lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its vibrant blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, strap-like leaves that form a dense rosette near the ground. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
