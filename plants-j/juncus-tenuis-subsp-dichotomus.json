    "intro": "Juncus tenuis subsp. dichotomus, commonly known as the slender rush, is a flowering plant in the family Juncaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. This subspecies is typically found in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and establish in waterlogged soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
