    "intro": "Juniperus scopulorum var. argentea, commonly known as the silver fir juniper, is a variant of the Rocky Mountain juniper. It is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to the western United States. The plant is characterized by its silvery-blue foliage, which results from dense, overlapping scales on the leaves. Its cones are typically small and berry-like, containing toxic seeds that are not suitable for human consumption. This variety thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions with cold, dry climates."
