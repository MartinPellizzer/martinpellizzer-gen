    "intro": "Juncus sherei, commonly known as the Sherei rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It typically grows in moist or wet environments such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are usually unbranched and covered in fine, grass-like leaves. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically arranged in spikes and bloom in early summer. Juncus sherei is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
