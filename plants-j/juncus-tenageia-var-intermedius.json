    "intro": "Juncus tenageia var. intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate rush, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Juncaceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and cylindrical spikes of small, greenish-white flowers. Native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile, this species thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes and stream banks. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
