    "intro": "Jasminum glabellum, commonly known as the Arabian jasmine, is a flowering plant native to the Arabian Peninsula. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters during the cooler months, usually from late winter to early spring. Its flowers are tubular and have a sweet, intoxicating fragrance, which attracts pollinators like bees and moths. Jasminum glabellum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
