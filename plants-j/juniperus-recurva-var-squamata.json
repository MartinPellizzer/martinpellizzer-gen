    "intro": "Juniperus recurva var. squamata, commonly known as the silver juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its scale-like leaves that give it a silvery appearance, and its compact, often sprawling growth habit. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often used in landscaping and restoration projects."
