    "intro": "Jatropha aesculifolia, commonly known as the horse chestnut jatropha, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which resemble those of the horse chestnut tree, and its clusters of yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that contain toxic seeds, making it potentially hazardous to humans and animals. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Jatropha aesculifolia is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking foliage and unique floral structure."
