    "intro": "Jatropha aspleniifolia, commonly known as the fernleaf spurge, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are usually alternate and deeply lobed. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in cyathia, typical of the spurge family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Jatropha aspleniifolia is also known for its latex sap, which can be toxic and is a defense mechanism against herbivores."
