    "intro": "Juniperus distans, commonly known as the creeping juniper, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. Juniperus distans thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Its hardy nature makes it a common ornamental plant in gardens and landscapes."
