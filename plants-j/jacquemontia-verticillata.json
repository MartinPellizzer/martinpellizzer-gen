    "intro": "Jacquemontia verticillata, commonly known as the whorled morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple. The plant has alternate, palmately lobed leaves that are often hairy and arranged in whorls around the stem. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it thrives in moist, sunny environments. Jacquemontia verticillata is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks."
