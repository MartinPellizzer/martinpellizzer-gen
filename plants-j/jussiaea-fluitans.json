    "intro": "Jussiaea fluitans, commonly known as the floating bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. It is characterized by its floating, leaf-like structures that are often covered in tiny, bladder-like organs used for capturing small aquatic organisms. The plant lacks true roots and instead has specialized structures called rhizoids that anchor it to substrates. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically green or yellowish, and appear above the water surface. Jussiaea fluitans plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by serving as both a predator of microorganisms and a habitat for other aquatic life."
