    "intro": "Jateorhiza calumba, commonly known as the African blue flag, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands and marshy areas, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The leaves are sword-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its wetland habitat."
