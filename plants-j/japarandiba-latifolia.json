    "intro": "Japarandiba latifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian broadleaf tree, is a tropical evergreen species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation projects."
