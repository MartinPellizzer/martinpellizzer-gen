    "intro": "Jussiaea nervosa var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy water-mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it its varietal name \"pubescens.\" The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a distinctive veining pattern that contributes to its scientific name, *nervosa*. This species thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, stream banks, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats."
