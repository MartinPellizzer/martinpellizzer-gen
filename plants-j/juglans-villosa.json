    "intro": "Juglans villosa, commonly known as the velvet walnut, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, pinnately compound leaves with serrated margins. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by oval, green fruits that mature to a dark purple color. The seeds, enclosed in a thick, fleshy husk, are edible after the husk is removed. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
