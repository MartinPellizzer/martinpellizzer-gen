    "intro": "Jacquinia keyensis var. minutifolia, commonly known as the Key Island bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the Florida Keys. It is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring. The plant grows in wetland habitats, often in marshes or along the edges of freshwater ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a fibrous root system adapted to waterlogged soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
