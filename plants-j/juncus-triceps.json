    "intro": "Juncus triceps, commonly known as the three-branched rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes during the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil in aquatic habitats. Juncus triceps is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits."
