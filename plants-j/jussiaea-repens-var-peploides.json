    "intro": "Jussiaea repens var. peploides, commonly known as the creeping jussiaea, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It features small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in moisture retention. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in nutrient-poor, waterlogged soils and is often found in coastal and freshwater wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, forming dense colonies that stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
