    "intro": "Juncus bhutanensis, commonly known as the Bhutan rush, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan region, particularly Bhutan. It belongs to the Juncaceae family and is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant typically grows in moist, mountainous areas and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered at the tips of the stems, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat.
