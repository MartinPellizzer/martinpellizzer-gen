It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 3 meters in height, featuring woody stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange to red berries containing toxic seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in coastal areas due to its tolerance for saline conditions. The plant is also noted for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment."
