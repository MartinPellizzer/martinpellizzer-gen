    "intro": "Jasione montana var. megaphylla, commonly known as the large-leafed bellflower, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny grasslands and rocky soils, preferring well-drained conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough, hairy texture. This variety is noted for its larger leaf size compared to the typical form of Jasione montana."
