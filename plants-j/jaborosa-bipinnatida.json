    "intro": "Jaborosa bipinnatida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved jaborosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features finely divided, bipinnate leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Jaborosa bipinnatida is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and stream banks."
