    "intro": "Jacobaea sinuata, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It features basal leaves that are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, with the upper leaves becoming more oval and gradually smaller. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its flowering stems are usually unbranched and can grow up to 40 centimeters tall. Jacobaea sinuata is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
