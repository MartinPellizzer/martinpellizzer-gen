    "intro": "Juniperus grandifolius, commonly known as the eastern red cedar, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The tree produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and small mammals. Juniperus grandifolius thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, sandy soils. It is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value."
