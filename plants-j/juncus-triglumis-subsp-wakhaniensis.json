    "intro": "Juncus triglumis subsp. wakhaniensis, commonly known as the Wakhani rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the island of Wakhani in the southern Maldives. It belongs to the Juncaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, tolerating saline and brackish water conditions. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of wax to reduce water loss. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to its marine environment."
