It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense foliage. The plant features small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers during the spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is typically found in heathlands and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
