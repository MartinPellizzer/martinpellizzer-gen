    "intro": "Justicia rupicola, commonly known as the rock justicia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and is adapted to survive in dry, nutrient-poor soils. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. Justicia rupicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a drought-tolerant landscape plant."
