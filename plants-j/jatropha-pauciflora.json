    "intro": "Jatropha pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered physic nut, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release toxic seeds, which contain compounds such as ricin. Jatropha pauciflora is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in dry, arid environments."
