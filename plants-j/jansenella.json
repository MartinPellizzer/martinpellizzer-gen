    "intro": "Jansenella, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, white, spider-like flowers and lack of leaves, relying entirely on its roots for survival. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi, which help it absorb nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its specialized habitat and ecological requirements, Jansenella is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a vulnerable species."
