It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist or wet environments such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that are often used for thatching and weaving due to their fibrous nature. Its small, spike-like inflorescence consists of numerous tiny, greenish-white flowers. Juncus textilis plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
