    "intro": "Jonesiopsis abbreviata, commonly known as the short-stemmed fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. The plant has slender, erect rhizomes that produce small, clustered leaves. Its fronds are bipinnate, with delicate, linear pinnae that give it a feathery appearance. Jonesiopsis abbreviata plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering impurities and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
