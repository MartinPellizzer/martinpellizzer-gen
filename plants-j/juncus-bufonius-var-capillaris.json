    "intro": "Juncus bufonius var. capillaris, commonly known as the narrowleaf rush, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands along the edges of ponds, lakes, and streams. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 1 millimeter wide, giving it a delicate appearance. Its small, clustered flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a light green to brownish color. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
