    "intro": "Jussiaea helminthorrhiza, commonly known as the swamp milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its spreading growth habit and its ability to thrive in saturated soils. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Jussiaea helminthorrhiza plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for native insects and wildlife."
