    "intro": "Juncus graecus, commonly known as the Greek rush, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a member of the Juncaceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late spring to early summer, consist of small, greenish-white flowers. Juncus graecus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
