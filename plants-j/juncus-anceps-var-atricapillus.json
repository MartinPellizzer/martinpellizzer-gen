    "intro": "Juncus anceps var. atricapillus, commonly known as the black-capped rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that often reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green or reddish in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in moist to wet environments such as wetlands and marshes. This variety is distinguished by its dark purple to black flower heads, which give it its common name."
