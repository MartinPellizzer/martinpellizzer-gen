    "intro": "Juncus continuus, commonly known as the common rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments across the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and tall, cylindrical inflorescences that produce small, greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist soils, often in marshes, swamps, or along the edges of ponds and lakes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Juncus continuus is also an important food source for various insects and wildlife."
