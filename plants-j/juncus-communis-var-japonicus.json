It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems that grow in dense clusters. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in spikes during the summer months. It thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and damp woodlands. Its ability to tolerate waterlogged soils makes it a common sight in wetland habitats."
