    "intro": "Juniperus foetida var. squarrulosa, commonly known as the squarrulosa juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, providing a striking visual contrast against the rocky terrain. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. This variety is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
