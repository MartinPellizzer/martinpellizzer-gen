    "intro": "Juncus effusus var. longibracteatus, commonly known as the long-bract rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and slender, cylindrical stems that often grow in clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like inflorescences, which are typically found at the tips of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and cylindrical, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in moist or wet conditions."
