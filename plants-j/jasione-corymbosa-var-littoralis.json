    "intro": "Jasione corymbosa var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal jasmine or sea jasmine, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found along shorelines, dunes, and rocky coastlines. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale blue, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered with fine hairs, and it has a fibrous root system adapted to salt-laden environments. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize coastal soils against erosion."
