It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features narrow, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in its dry habitat. Its small, white or pink flowers bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Jurinea charcoviensis is well adapted to sandy and rocky soils, making it a hardy species in harsh environments."
