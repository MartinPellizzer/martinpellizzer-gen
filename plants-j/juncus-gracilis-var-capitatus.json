    "intro": "Juncus gracilis var. capitatus, commonly known as the slender rush with a clustered head, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are typically reddish or brownish in color. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water. The varietal form 'capitatus' distinguishes it by its more clustered flowering structure compared to the typical form of Juncus gracilis."
