    "intro": "Jacaranda ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf jacaranda, is a deciduous tree native to South America, particularly Argentina and Uruguay. It is characterized by its striking clusters of violet-blue flowers that bloom in the spring. The leaves are oval-shaped, hence the species name, and are arranged oppositely along the branches. The tree has a fibrous, bark-like trunk and can grow up to 15 meters tall. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to warm, dry climates."
