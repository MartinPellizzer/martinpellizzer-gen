    "intro": "Justicia upembensis, commonly known as the Upemba justicia, is a flowering plant native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along riverbanks and in dense forests. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The Upemba justicia is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
