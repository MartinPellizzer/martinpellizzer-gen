    "intro": "Jussiaea prostrata var. philippiana, commonly known as the Philippine jussiaea, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Philippines. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often near the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in dense undergrowth. Its adaptability to wet conditions makes it a common sight in tropical and subtropical regions."
