    "intro": "Juniperus oxycedrus, commonly known as the Spanish juniper, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its dense, scaly foliage and small, dark blue berries that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. Its cones, which are actually berry-like structures, mature in the second year and are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Juniperus oxycedrus is also valued for its aromatic wood, which has been used in traditional crafts and as a source of essential oils."
