    "intro": "Juncus acutus subsp. tommasinii, commonly known as the Tommasini rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist to wet environments such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. The plant has narrow, cylindrical leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its dense growth habit and ability to thrive in poorly drained soils. This subspecies is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and adaptability."
