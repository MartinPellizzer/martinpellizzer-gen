    "intro": "Jasminocereus thouarsii var. sclerocarpus, commonly known as the desert night-blooming cereus, is a cactus species native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and its ability to store water in its fleshy, segmented structure. The plant produces striking, fragrant white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to drought conditions. This variety is notable for its resilience and unique floral display in its native habitat."
