    "intro": "Juglans regia var. corcyrensis, commonly known as the Persian walnut, is a subspecies of the common walnut native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its large, elongated, and often lobed leaves, which are typically dark green and have a rough texture. The tree produces clusters of green, hairy fruits that mature to a dark brown color, containing one or two edible seeds. Its nuts are highly valued for their rich flavor and are used in both culinary and commercial applications. This variety is also notable for its hardiness and ability to thrive in temperate climates with well-drained soils."
