    "intro": "Jatropha macrorhiza var. septemfida, commonly known as the seven-lobed physic nut, is a variant of the physic nut plant native to parts of Africa. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves with seven lobes, which give it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by spiny, capsule-like fruits containing toxic seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
