It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows to a height of 15\u201330 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. This species is noted for its hardiness and ability to naturalize, often returning year after year in suitable climates."
