    "intro": "Jollydora elimaboura, commonly known as the golden leaf orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow and green foliage, which reflects its name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically blooming during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
