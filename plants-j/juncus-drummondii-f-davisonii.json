    "intro": "Juncus drummondii f. davisonii, commonly known as the Davison's rush, is a flowering plant belonging to the Juncaceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and cylindrical spikes of small, pale green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil in wetland environments. The species is native to North America and is often found in the western United States."
