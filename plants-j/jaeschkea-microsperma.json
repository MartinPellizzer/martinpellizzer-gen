    "intro": "Jaeschkea microsperma, commonly known as the small-seeded jaeschkea, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces tiny, dry fruits that contain minute seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a cool, moist environment to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Jaeschkea microsperma is considered a species of conservation concern."
