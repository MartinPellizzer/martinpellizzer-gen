    "intro": "Juncus inflexus subsp. inflexus, commonly known as the bent rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of white or pale green flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in suitable habitats. Juncus inflexus subsp. inflexus plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
