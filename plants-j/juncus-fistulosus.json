    "intro": "Juncus fistulosus, commonly known as the hollow rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems that are hollow and often have a reddish or purplish hue. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters near the base of the stems, typically in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, growing in dense tufts at the base. Juncus fistulosus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
