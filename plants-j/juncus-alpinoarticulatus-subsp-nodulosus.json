    "intro": "Juncus alpinoarticulatus subsp. nodulosus, commonly known as the alpine clubmoss, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and wiry, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils at high altitudes. This subspecies is notable for its ability to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in alpine environments."
