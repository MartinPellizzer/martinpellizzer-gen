    "intro": "Juncus effusus var. elatus, commonly known as the tall rush, is a flowering plant species native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically growing in dense clusters at the base of the plant. This variety is well adapted to moist soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and other wet habitats."
