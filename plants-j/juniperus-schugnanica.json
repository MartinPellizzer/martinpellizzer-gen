    "intro": "Juniperus schugnanica, commonly known as the Schugnan juniper, is a rare and endemic species native to the Caucasus region. It is a small evergreen shrub or tree that typically grows in rocky, mountainous areas. The plant features scale-like leaves that are densely packed, giving it a compact appearance. Its cones are small and berry-like, containing the aromatic seeds that are used in traditional medicine. Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, Juniperus schugnanica is considered a conservation concern."
