    "intro": "Juncus filiformis transsilvanicus, commonly known as the Transylvanian rush, is a perennial plant native to Europe, particularly found in wetlands and marshy areas. It belongs to the Juncaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems that grow in dense clusters. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in spike-like inflorescences, typically blooming in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and cylindrical, often with a slight sheen, and it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland habitats and providing shelter for various wildlife species."
