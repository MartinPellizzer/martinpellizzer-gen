It grows in marshy environments, often forming dense stands that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The plant has cylindrical, hollow stems that are typically green or reddish in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered flowers that are often pale green or brown. Juncus benghalensis plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
