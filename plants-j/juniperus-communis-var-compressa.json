    "intro": "Juniperus communis var. compressa, commonly known as the creeping juniper, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features dense, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, providing a striking visual contrast to its dark red or purple stems. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value. This variety is particularly valued for its ability to form dense ground cover in rocky or sandy environments."
