    "intro": "Juglans \u00d7 intermedia alata, commonly known as the winged hickory, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between black walnut (Juglans nigra) and Persian walnut (Juglans regia). It is characterized by its distinctive winged seeds, which are adapted for wind dispersal. The plant produces large, edible nuts enclosed in a thick, green husk that splits open when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in the eastern United States. Its botanical features make it valuable for both ornamental and commercial purposes."
