    "intro": "Justicia hayatae, commonly known as the Hayata's flameflower, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, often reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its foliage consists of opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their shape and nectar-rich structure."
