It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow foliage, which is variegated with white and green streaks. The plant has scale-like leaves that are densely packed, giving it a dense, rounded appearance. It produces small, blue-black berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. This variety is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant due to its ornamental value."
