    "intro": "Jasminocereus howellii var. delicatus, commonly known as the fragrant night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems and its ability to produce fragrant, white flowers at night. The plant thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its flowers, which open in the evening, are often pollinated by nocturnal insects such as moths. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant once established."
