The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often slightly hairy, and it produces small, clustered spikelets of greenish or brownish flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to wet environments and its role in stabilizing soil in riparian zones."
