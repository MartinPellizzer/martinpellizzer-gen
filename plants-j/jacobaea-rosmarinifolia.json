    "intro": "Jacobaea rosmarinifolia, commonly known as the Mediterranean everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant has silvery-gray foliage due to fine, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It is often cultivated as a ornamental plant for its long-lasting blooms and drought tolerance. Jacobaea rosmarinifolia is also valued in herbal medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties."
