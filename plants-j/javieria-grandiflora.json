    "intro": "Javieria grandiflora, commonly known as the giant marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, and it produces numerous inflorescences throughout the growing season. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
