    "intro": "Junellia arequipense, commonly known as the Arequipa junellia, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of southern Peru. It belongs to the family Polemoniaceae and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Junellia arequipense is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in specialized gardens."
