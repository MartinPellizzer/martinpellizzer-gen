    "intro": "Jatropha canescens, commonly known as the whiteleaf jatropha, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and elliptical leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers followed by spiny, three-lobed fruits containing toxic seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and potential for biofuel production, it is cultivated in some parts of the world."
