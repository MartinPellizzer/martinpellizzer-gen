    "intro": "Jarava polyclada, commonly known as the clustered jarava, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in compact, dense clumps with slender, wiry stems that often root at the base. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
