    "intro": "Juncus ingens, commonly known as the giant rush, is a tall, grass-like plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant has long, narrow leaves that form dense stands, and it produces small, spike-like flower clusters in the summer. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland areas. Juncus ingens is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
