    "intro": "Jaegeria bellidioides, commonly known as the bellidium grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in coastal and sandy soils, often found in dune environments. The plant has slender, tufted stems with small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, pale yellow to green flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive blue-gray sheen. Jaegeria bellidioides is adapted to arid conditions and is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sand dunes."
