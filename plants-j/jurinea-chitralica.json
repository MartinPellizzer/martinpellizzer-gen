    "intro": "Jurinea chitralica, commonly known as the Chitral sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Jurinea chitralica is adapted to cold, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes."
