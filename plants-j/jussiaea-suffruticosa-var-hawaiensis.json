    "intro": "Jussiaea suffruticosa var. hawaiensis, commonly known as Hawaiian jussiaea, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a shrub-like species characterized by its small, opposite leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, often on sandy or rocky soils, and is adapted to the tropical climate of Hawaii. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides habitat for native insects and birds. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
