    "intro": "Justicia contorta, commonly known as the twisted justicia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its twisted, branching stems. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which are highly attractive to pollinators. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a rough texture. Justicia contorta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
