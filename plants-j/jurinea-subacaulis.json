    "intro": "Jurinea subacaulis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sea-blite, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It thrives in saline and sandy environments, often found along shorelines and dunes. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine layer of salt-excreting glands, aiding in its adaptation to harsh coastal conditions. Its flowers are typically pale green or yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits that disperse seeds by wind. Jurinea subacaulis plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and preventing erosion."
