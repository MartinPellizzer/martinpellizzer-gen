    "intro": "Jamesonia imbricata var. canescens, commonly known as the silky leaf bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a soft, silvery-green hue. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, fuzzy layer, giving it a distinctive, almost velvety appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
