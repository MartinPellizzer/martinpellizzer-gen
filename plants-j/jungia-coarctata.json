    "intro": "Jungia coarctata, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant has grass-like leaves that are narrow and somewhat stiff, with a characteristic dark green color. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikes and are pollinated by wind. Jungia coarctata plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
