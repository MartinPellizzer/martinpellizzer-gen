It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically clustered at the base, forming dense tufts. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes, which are often hidden among the foliage. It thrives in wet or damp soils, making it a common sight in marshes, stream banks, and other wetland habitats. Its botanical structure is adapted for water retention, with a fibrous root system and a compact growth form."
