    "intro": "Jatropha stimulosa, commonly known as the stimulant jatropha, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing toxic, orange seeds. Jatropha stimulosa is part of the Euphorbiaceae family, known for its latex-producing properties. Due to the toxicity of its seeds, it is often avoided as a food source and is more notable for its ecological and historical significance."
