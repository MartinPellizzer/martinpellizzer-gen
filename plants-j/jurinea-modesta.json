    "intro": "Jurinea modesta, commonly known as the modest sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, hairy leaves and produces tiny, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in clusters. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can survive in harsh, dry conditions. Jurinea modesta is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
