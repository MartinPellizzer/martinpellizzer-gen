    "intro": "Juncus tanguticus, commonly known as the Tibetan rush, is a perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of Asia, including Tibet, China, and the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and cylindrical flower spikes that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and mountainous areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization in its native habitat. Juncus tanguticus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
