    "intro": "Jateorhiza miersii, commonly known as the Miers' ginseng, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, clustered root system that resembles the structure of true ginseng. The plant features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, white, fragrant flowers during the spring season. Its roots are valued in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits, though scientific validation remains limited. Due to habitat destruction and overharvesting, Jateorhiza miersii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
