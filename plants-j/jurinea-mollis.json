    "intro": "Jurinea mollis, commonly known as the soft jurinea, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Jurinea mollis is often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in cold, nutrient-poor conditions."
