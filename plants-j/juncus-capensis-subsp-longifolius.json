It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically borne in clusters at the top of the stems. It thrives in wetland habitats, including marshes and along the edges of water bodies. The leaves are long and narrow, often with a prominent midrib, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
