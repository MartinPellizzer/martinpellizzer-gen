    "intro": "Justicia sinuata, commonly known as the sinuous jewelweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its vibrant orange to red tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant has heart-shaped, slightly lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through runners make it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential weed in certain habitats."
