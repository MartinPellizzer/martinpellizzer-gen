    "intro": "Juncus uliginosus repens, commonly known as the creeping marsh rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It forms dense mats of grass-like foliage with narrow, cylindrical leaves that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to water-saturated soils, often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
