    "intro": "Juncus himalensis, commonly known as the Himalayan rush, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, slender cylindrical stems that are typically covered in fine, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear greenish-white flowers, which are usually wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Juncus himalensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky or unstable environments."
