    "intro": "Jussiaea grandiflora f. natans, commonly known as the floating willow, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and the presence of submerged or floating leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, with a waxy surface that aids in buoyancy. This species is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes."
