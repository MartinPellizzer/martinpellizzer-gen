    "intro": "Juncus liniger, commonly known as the hairy rush, is a perennial plant belonging to the Juncaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and slender, cylindrical stems that often grow in moist or wet environments. The plant typically reaches heights of 30 to 60 centimeters and features small, inconspicuous flowers that appear in early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense clusters, making it a common sight in wetlands and along stream banks. Juncus liniger is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
