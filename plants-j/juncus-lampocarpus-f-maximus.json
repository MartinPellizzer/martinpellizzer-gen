It is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces cylindrical spikes of small, brownish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in saline or brackish wetlands, often found in tidal marshes and estuaries. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms."
