    "intro": "Jacobaea anthorifolia, commonly known as the leafless ragwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a fibrous root system and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often found in grasslands and open areas, where it can form dense colonies. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a weed in some regions and requires careful management."
