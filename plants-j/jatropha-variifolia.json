It is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves that vary in shape and size, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by spiny capsules containing toxic seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
