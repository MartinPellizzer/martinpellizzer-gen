    "intro": "Jagera discolor, commonly known as the white-flowered jagera, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of northern Australia. It features simple, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by round, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and open woodlands. Jagera discolor is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and flowering habit."
