It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows up to 1-2 meters tall, featuring heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces striking clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that are often surrounded by showy bracts. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
