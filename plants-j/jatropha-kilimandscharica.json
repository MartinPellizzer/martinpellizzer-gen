    "intro": "Jatropha kilimandscharica, commonly known as the Kilimanjaro croton, is a shrub native to East Africa, particularly the high-altitude regions of the East African Rift Valley. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and clusters of yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the dry season. The plant produces small, toxic berries that are often used in traditional medicine despite their harmful properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Jatropha kilimandscharica is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh climates."
