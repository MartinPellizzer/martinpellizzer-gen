    "intro": "Juncus ensifolius var. major, commonly known as the tall rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in spike-like clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, contributing to its overall rush-like appearance. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife."
