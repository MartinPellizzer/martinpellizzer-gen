    "intro": "Johnsonia lupulina var. teretifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed Johnsonia, is a rare and unique plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with multiple stems arising from the base. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant species of conservation concern."
