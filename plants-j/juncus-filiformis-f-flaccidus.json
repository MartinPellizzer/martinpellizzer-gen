    "intro": "Juncus filiformis f. flaccidus, commonly known as the flaccid rush, is a variant of the slender rush species native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its soft, drooping stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. This form exhibits a more flexible and less rigid structure compared to the typical Juncus filiformis. It thrives in moist soils, often found in marshes, pond margins, and along streams. The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
