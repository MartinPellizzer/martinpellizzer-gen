    "intro": "Jacea supina, commonly known as the prostrate jacea, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It typically features slender, creeping stems that lie close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and slightly hairy, contributing to its drought-resistant characteristics. Jacea supina is often found in dry, rocky soils and is valued in traditional herbal medicine for its purported medicinal properties."
