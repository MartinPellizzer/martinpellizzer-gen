    "intro": "Janotia macrostipula, commonly known as the large-stipitate Janotia, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its distinctive morphological features. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, temperate environments, often found in shaded woodlands or along streambanks. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic, and its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, a common trait among members of its family. Janotia macrostipula is notable for its long, stiff bracts that enclose the inflorescence, giving it a unique appearance. It plays a role in supporting local insect populations and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations in shaded habitats."
