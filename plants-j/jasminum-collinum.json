    "intro": "Jasminum collinum, commonly known as the mountain jasmine, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters, featuring woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the spring and summer. These flowers are borne on pedicels and have a strong, sweet scent, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Jasminum collinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic and aromatic qualities."
