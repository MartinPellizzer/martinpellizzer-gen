    "intro": "Jatropha vitifolia f. nana, commonly known as the dwarf grapeleaf jatropha, is a compact variant of the Jatropha genus. It is characterized by its small, glossy, ovate leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that give way to orange-red berries, which contain toxic seeds. It is native to tropical regions of South America and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Due to its unique foliage and compact growth habit, it is well-suited for container gardening and small spaces."
