    "intro": "Juncus effusus f. zebrinus, commonly known as the zebra rush, is a flowering plant belonging to the Juncaceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its tall, grass-like stems that are often striped with alternating light and dark green bands, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color, which bloom in late summer. Native to wetland areas in Europe and Asia, it thrives in moist to aquatic environments. Its striking visual appeal makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in ponds and water gardens."
