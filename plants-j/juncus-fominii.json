    "intro": "Juncus fominii, commonly known as the Fomin's rush, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that are usually unbranched and covered in dense, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered in spike-like inflorescences, producing light brown to reddish seeds. Juncus fominii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
