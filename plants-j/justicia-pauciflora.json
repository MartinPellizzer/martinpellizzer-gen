    "intro": "Justicia pauciflora, commonly known as the silverleaf justicia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces spikes of small, tubular flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, Justicia pauciflora is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
