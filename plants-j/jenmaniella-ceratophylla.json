    "intro": "Jenmaniella ceratophylla, commonly known as the horned fern, is a unique plant belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that resemble horns, giving it its common name. This fern typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are bioluminescent, a rare trait among ferns, which helps it attract pollinators at night. The plant's ability to thrive in low-light conditions makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
