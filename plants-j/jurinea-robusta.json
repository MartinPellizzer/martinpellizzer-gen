    "intro": "Jurinea robusta, commonly known as the robust sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with hairy, succulent leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to withstand drought conditions. Jurinea robusta plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
