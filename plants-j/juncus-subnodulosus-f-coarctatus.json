    "intro": "Juncus subnodulosus f. coarctatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Juncaceae and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. Its botanical features include slender stems that are often reddish in color and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. This subspecies is noted for its compact growth habit and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
