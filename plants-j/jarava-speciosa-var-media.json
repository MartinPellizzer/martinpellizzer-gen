    "intro": "Jarava speciosa var. media, commonly known as the slender bottlebrush grass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, feathery flowers, typical of the grass family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and arid landscapes. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
