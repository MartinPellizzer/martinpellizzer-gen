    "intro": "Jatropha sinuata, commonly known as the zigzag jatropha, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters, featuring compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into capsules containing toxic, orange-red seeds. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging stems and is often found in disturbed soils and along stream banks. Due to its toxicity, it is not commonly cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
