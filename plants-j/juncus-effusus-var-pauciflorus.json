    "intro": "Juncus effusus var. pauciflorus, commonly known as the sparse-flowered rush, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and damp woodlands. The plant features slender, cylindrical stems that are usually hairless and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spike of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. This variety is characterized by its reduced flowering compared to the typical form of Juncus effusus, making it a distinctive feature in its ecological niche."
