    "intro": "Jurinea neicevii, commonly known as the coastal sandflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid and coastal regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy and saline soils, often found in dunes and coastal plains. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Jurinea neicevii plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion."
