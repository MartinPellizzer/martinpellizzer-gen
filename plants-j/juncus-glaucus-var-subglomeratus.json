It features narrow, cylindrical leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are often borne on long, slender stems. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in coastal areas or along freshwater wetlands. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for ecological studies and wetland restoration projects."
