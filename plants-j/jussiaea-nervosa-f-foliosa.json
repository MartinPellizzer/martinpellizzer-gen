    "intro": "Jussiaea nervosa f. foliosa, commonly known as the broad-leafed jussiaea, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Onagraceae. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often densely arranged along the stems. The plant produces small, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or white in color. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. This variant is distinguished by its foliage structure, which differs from the typical form of Jussiaea nervosa."
