    "intro": "Juncus articulatus radicans, commonly known as the spreading rush, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves that form a mat-like growth pattern. The plant typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in marshes, wetlands, and along the edges of ponds. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late spring to early summer, consist of small, inconspicuous greenish flowers. Juncus articulatus radicans plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
