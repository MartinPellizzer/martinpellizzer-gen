    "intro": "Juniperus zacatecensis, commonly known as the Zacatecas juniper, is a species of evergreen conifer native to Mexico. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and produces small, blue-black berries that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various animals. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
