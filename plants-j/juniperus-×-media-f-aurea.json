    "intro": "Juniperus \u00d7 media f. aurea, commonly known as the golden juniper, is a compact, slow-growing shrub or small tree native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is a hybrid between Juniperus scopulorum and Juniperus horizontalis, characterized by its dense, mound-like form and vibrant golden foliage. The leaves are scale-like, tightly pressed to the stems, and retain their color throughout the growing season. It produces small, blue-black berries that are often used in culinary applications. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
