    "intro": "Justicia tetragona, commonly known as the four-cornered jewelweed, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, with two lips, resembling those of orchids. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Justicia tetragona thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
