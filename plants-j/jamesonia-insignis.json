    "intro": "Jamesonia insignis, commonly known as the mountain snowbell, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
