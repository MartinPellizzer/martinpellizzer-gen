    "intro": "Juncus ochraceus, commonly known as the yellow rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland areas of North America. It features tall, cylindrical stems that are often reddish or yellowish in color, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters near the top of the stems, typically in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant thrives in moist or wet soils. Juncus ochraceus plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
