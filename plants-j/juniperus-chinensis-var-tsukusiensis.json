    "intro": "Juniperus chinensis var. tsukusiensis, commonly known as the Japanese yew or Japanese juniper, is a compact, evergreen shrub or small tree native to Japan. It features dense, scale-like leaves that are typically dark green, providing a lush appearance throughout the year. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to form dense, attractive shapes when pruned."
