It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, cylindrical inflorescences that resemble bottle brushes. The plant produces small, pink to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often covered with fine, hair-like structures. This species is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in dunes and coastal scrub habitats."
