    "intro": "Juncus lampocarpus var. salinus, commonly known as salt marsh rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal areas of North America. It thrives in saline environments, such as salt marshes and tidal flats, and is adapted to withstand periodic flooding and high salinity. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green or bluish-gray, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. Its root system is extensive, helping to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in its habitat. This species plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
