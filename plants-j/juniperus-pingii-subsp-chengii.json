It is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in mountainous regions with well-drained soils and a temperate climate. This subspecies is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
