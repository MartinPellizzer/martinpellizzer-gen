    "intro": "Juncus allioides, commonly known as the garlic rush, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features grass-like, narrow leaves that are often mistaken for grasses or sedges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and stream banks. Its bulbs, which resemble garlic cloves, are edible and have a mild, garlic-like flavor."
