    "intro": "Jossinia littoralis, commonly known as the coastal jossinia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. The plant thrives in sandy or saline soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, often covered in a fine layer of salt-tolerant hairs. Jossinia littoralis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
