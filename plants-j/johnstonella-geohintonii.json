    "intro": "Johnstonella geohintonii, commonly known as the Hinton's ghostflower, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the remote highlands of Jamaica. It is a small, herbaceous plant with delicate, pale green to white flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a short stem and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Johnstonella geohintonii is adapted to grow in shaded, moist environments, often found in rocky crevices or among dense vegetation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species."
