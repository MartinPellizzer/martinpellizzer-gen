    "intro": "Juniperus sabina var. vulgaris, commonly known as common juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with scale-like leaves arranged in dense, flat sprays. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and small mammals. Its aromatic wood is historically used in construction and as a source of essential oils. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions."
