    "intro": "Juniperus horizontalis var. alpina, commonly known as the Alpine creeping juniper, is a low-growing shrub native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features dense, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, providing a striking visual contrast in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are often used in traditional medicine and as a spice in cooking. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact form and hardy nature make it a popular choice for landscaping in colder climates."
