    "intro": "Juncus nevadensis var. columbianus, commonly known as the Columbia rush, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like flower clusters. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks, wet meadows, and other wetland habitats. It has fibrous roots that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The Columbia rush is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to thrive in wet conditions."
