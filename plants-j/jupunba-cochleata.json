    "intro": "Jupunba cochleata, commonly known as the spiral leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves, which is an adaptation to the strong winds and intense sunlight of its habitat. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a humid environment to flourish. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
