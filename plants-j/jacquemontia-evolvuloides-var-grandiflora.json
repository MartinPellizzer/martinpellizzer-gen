    "intro": "Jacquemontia evolvuloides var. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered morning glory, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue to purple in color. The plant blooms in late spring to early summer and is characterized by its rapid growth habit and climbing nature. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, loamy soils. The flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other pollinators, making it an important species for supporting local insect populations."
