It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, cylindrical leaves and tall, spiky flower clusters. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It has small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, often blooming in late spring to early summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland habitats."
