    "intro": "Jasminum lanceolaria f. unifoliolatum, commonly known as the single leaf jasmine, is a unique variant of the common jasmine species. It is characterized by its reduced foliage, featuring only a single leaf per node, which distinguishes it from the typical multi-leaf structure of its parent species. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typical of the jasmine genus. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and aromatic properties. This cultivar is valued in horticulture for its compact growth habit and distinctive appearance."
