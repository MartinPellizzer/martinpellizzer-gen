    "intro": "Jatropha wightiana, commonly known as the Wight's blistering tree, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by orange-red, spiny capsules containing toxic seeds. It is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in open forests. Due to the toxicity of its seeds, it is important to handle the plant with care."
