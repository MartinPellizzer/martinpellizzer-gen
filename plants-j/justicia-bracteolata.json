It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. The leaves and flowers are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and healing properties."
