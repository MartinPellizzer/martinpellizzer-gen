    "intro": "Juglans arizonica, commonly known as the Arizona walnut, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the walnut family, Juglandaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive, edible nuts. The tree produces small, yellow-green flowers in early spring, followed by oval-shaped fruits that mature in late summer. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing some protection against drought and fire. The Arizona walnut is valued for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in arid environments."
