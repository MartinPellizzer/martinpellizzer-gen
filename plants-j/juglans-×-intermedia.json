    "intro": "Juglans \u00d7 intermedia, commonly known as the hybrid walnut, is a cross between the black walnut (Juglans nigra) and the English walnut (Juglans regia). It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, featuring compound leaves with 15\u201323 leaflets. The tree produces green, spherical fruits that mature to a dark green or brown color, encased in a thick, spiky husk. Its nuts are generally smaller than those of the English walnut but are prized for their flavor and oil content. The plant is native to the United States and is cultivated for both ornamental and commercial purposes."
