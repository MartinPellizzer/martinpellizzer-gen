    "intro": "Juniperus deltoides f. yaltirikiana, commonly known as the Yaltirikiana juniper, is a compact, shrub-like evergreen with dense, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. It produces small, berry-like cones that are typically dark blue to black when mature, containing toxic compounds. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Turkey and is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils. It has a slow growth rate and is often used in rock gardens or as a decorative hedge due to its hardy nature. The foliage retains its color year-round, making it an attractive addition to winter gardens."
