    "intro": "Juncus tenageia var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of the Americas. It typically grows in moist to wet environments such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. The plant has cylindrical, grass-like stems that are often slightly hairy and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spike of small, three-lobed flowers that are usually greenish or reddish in color. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
