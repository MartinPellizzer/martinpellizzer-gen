    "intro": "Juncus bufonius var. virens, commonly known as the green rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It features tall, grass-like stems that are typically green to reddish in color, growing up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters near the base of the stems, which are often surrounded by bracts. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in moist habitats."
