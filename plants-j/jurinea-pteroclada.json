    "intro": "Jurinea pteroclada, commonly known as the sand saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in sandy or gravelly soils. Jurinea pteroclada is well adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability."
