    "intro": "Juncus lampocarpus var. obtusiflorus, commonly known as the blunt-flowered rush, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swales, and stream banks. Its flowers are usually greenish or reddish and bloom in late summer to early fall. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wetland wildlife."
