    "intro": "Juttadinteria longipetala, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub that produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its leaves are small and succulent, helping to reduce water loss. The flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant plays a role in supporting local biodiversity."
