    "intro": "Juncus bufonius subsp. hybridus, commonly known as the hybrid rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and pond edges. The plant has cylindrical, grass-like stems that are often reddish or greenish in color. Its inflorescence consists of dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers that are usually pale green to brownish. The leaves are narrow, flat, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its wetland environment."
