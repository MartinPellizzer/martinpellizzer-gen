It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The inflorescence consists of dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. This plant thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, stream banks, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems, supporting various wildlife and contributing to soil stabilization."
