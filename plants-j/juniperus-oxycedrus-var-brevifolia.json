    "intro": "Juniperus oxycedrus var. brevifolia, commonly known as the dwarf juniper or rock juniper, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, needle-like foliage that is typically bluish-green in color, providing a striking visual contrast against rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It is highly adaptable, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its slow growth and hardy nature, it is often used as a decorative plant in arid or semi-arid environments."
