    "intro": "Jungia mitis, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in wetlands or near water bodies. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native flora."
