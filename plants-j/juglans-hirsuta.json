    "intro": "Juglans hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy walnut, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, doubly serrated leaves and stout, spiny fruit husks that encase the edible nuts. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, with separate male and female flowers on different trees. Its bark is thick and deeply furrowed, often with a rough, greyish texture. Juglans hirsuta is valued for its hard, durable wood and its potential as a food source for wildlife."
