    "intro": "Jonesiopsis incrassata, commonly known as the thickened Jonesiopsis, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its woody stems and evergreen leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded environments within forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species in botanical research."
