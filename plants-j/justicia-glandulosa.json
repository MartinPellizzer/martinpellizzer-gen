    "intro": "Justicia glandulosa, commonly known as the stickyweed or glandular justicia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and spikes of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and in wetlands. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Justicia glandulosa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
