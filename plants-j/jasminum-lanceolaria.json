It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters, featuring slender, somewhat woody stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, usually in the spring and summer months. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and lance-shaped, giving it its scientific name. The flowers are known for their strong, sweet scent, which attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies."
