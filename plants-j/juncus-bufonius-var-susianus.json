    "intro": "Juncus bufonius var. susianus, commonly known as the Susian rush, is a perennial plant native to parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies. Its leaves are narrow and cylindrical, with a smooth surface and a fibrous texture. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
