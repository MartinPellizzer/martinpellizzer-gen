    "intro": "Juniperus chinensis f. procumbens-aureovariegata, commonly known as the golden variegated Chinese juniper, is a compact, low-growing shrub characterized by its slow growth rate and dense, mat-forming habit. Its foliage consists of small, needle-like leaves that display a striking variegation of yellow and green, adding ornamental value to gardens. The plant is native to China and is often cultivated for its ornamental appeal rather than for its fruit. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Due to its slow growth, it requires minimal pruning and is relatively disease-resistant."
