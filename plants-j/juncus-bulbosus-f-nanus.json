    "intro": "Juncus bulbosus f. nanus, commonly known as the dwarf bulblet rush, is a compact, low-growing plant native to wetland environments. It features dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in shallow water or moist soils, thriving in environments with consistent hydration. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in water gardens or as a ground cover in wetland landscapes."
