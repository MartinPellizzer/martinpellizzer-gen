    "intro": "Jatropha diversifolia var. tupifolia, commonly known as the dense-leaved physic nut, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often densely pubescent on the underside. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers followed by spiny, three-lobed capsules containing toxic, orange-red seeds. Its foliage is characterized by a distinctive, velvety texture due to the dense pubescence. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has potential uses in traditional medicine."
