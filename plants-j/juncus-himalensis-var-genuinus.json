It belongs to the Juncaceae family and is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky or alpine habitats and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny greenish-white flowers. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
