    "intro": "Juncus triglumis var. albescens, commonly known as the white rush, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and slender, white or pale green stems that often form thick mats. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters near the base of the stems, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is distinguished by its pale coloration compared to the more common green form of Juncus triglumis."
