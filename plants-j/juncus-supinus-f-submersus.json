This plant is characterized by its submerged growth habit, with stems that are typically fully underwater. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to the water environment. It plays a role in stabilizing aquatic sediments and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms. The plant is often found in slow-moving or still freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes."
