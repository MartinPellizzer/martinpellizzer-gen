It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling a cluster of jewels. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it store water, adapting to its harsh, dry environment. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in dry climates."
