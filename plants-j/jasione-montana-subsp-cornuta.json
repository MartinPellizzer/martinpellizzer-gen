    "intro": "Jasione montana subsp. cornuta, commonly known as the horned chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces distinctive, slender, horn-like seed pods that give it its common name. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky habitats. Jasione montana subsp. cornuta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
