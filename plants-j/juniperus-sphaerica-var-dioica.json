    "intro": "Juniperus sphaerica var. dioica, commonly known as the dwarf juniper or spherical juniper, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spherical growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces both male and female cones on separate plants, a feature known as dioecy, which is common in many juniper species. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and as an ornamental plant. Its resilience to cold and drought further enhances its adaptability to various garden environments."
