    "intro": "Jurinea consanguinea subsp. neicevii, commonly known as the Neicevii sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapting to its harsh, dry environment. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is typically found in steppe and desert scrub habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized flora species."
