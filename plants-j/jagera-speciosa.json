    "intro": "Jagera speciosa, commonly known as the Christmas bell, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of northern Australia. It is characterized by its large, showy red bracts that resemble Christmas bells, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens in warm climates. The species is also valued for its hardiness and ability to attract birds and insects."
