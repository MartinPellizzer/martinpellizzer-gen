    "intro": "Juncus arcticus subsp. ater, commonly known as the dark rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of dark green to blackish leaves that are typically shorter than those of other juncus species. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing greenish or brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environment."
