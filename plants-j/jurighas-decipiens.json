    "intro": "Jurighas decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive jurigha, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, violet-blue petals that resemble those of more common species, potentially aiding in pollinator attraction. The plant has a compact growth habit with a short stem and dense foliage. Its flowers bloom in late summer, producing nectar that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
