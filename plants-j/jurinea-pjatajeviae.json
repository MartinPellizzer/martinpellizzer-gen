    "intro": "Jurinea pjatajeviae, commonly known as the Pjatajew's sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Black Sea. It is characterized by its delicate, blue or purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime climates. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Jurinea pjatajeviae plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
