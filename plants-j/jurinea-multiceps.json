It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is adapted to salty and windy environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. Its succulent leaves help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Jurinea multiceps is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardiness."
