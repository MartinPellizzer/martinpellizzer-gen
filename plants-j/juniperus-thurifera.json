    "intro": "Juniperus thurifera, commonly known as the Canary Island juniper, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves and small, blue-black berries that are typically harvested for use in gin production. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid and coastal climates of its native habitat. It has a slow growth rate and can live for several decades, making it a valuable component of the local flora. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
