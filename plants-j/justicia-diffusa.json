    "intro": "Justicia diffusa, commonly known as the silverleaf justicia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a contrasting purple or red throat. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Justicia diffusa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
