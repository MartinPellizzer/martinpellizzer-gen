    "intro": "Juncus inflexus var. prolifer, commonly known as the spreading rush, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and slender, cylindrical stems that often form dense clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes during the summer months, typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often found in areas with standing water or saturated ground. This variant is notable for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, contributing to its colonizing nature in suitable habitats."
