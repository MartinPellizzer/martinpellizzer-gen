    "intro": "Juniperus sphaerica var. luptonii, commonly known as the Lupton's juniper, is a rare and compact shrub native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its dense, spherical growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are usually blue or black when mature, containing toxic seeds. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to the arid climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
