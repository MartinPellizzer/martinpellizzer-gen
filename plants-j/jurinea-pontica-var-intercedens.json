    "intro": "Jurinea pontica var. intercedens, commonly known as the coastal sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Black Sea and the eastern Mediterranean. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in sandy and saline soils, often found in dune environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in arid conditions. This variety is noted for its ecological importance in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
