    "intro": "Juniperus chinensis var. aurea, commonly known as golden juniper, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to China. It is characterized by its dense, yellow-green foliage that turns a striking golden hue in the fall. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are typically bird-dispersed. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant color and year-round structure."
