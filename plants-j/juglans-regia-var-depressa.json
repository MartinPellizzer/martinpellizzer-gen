    "intro": "Juglans regia var. depressa, commonly known as the Persian walnut, is a variant of the common walnut native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. This subspecies is characterized by its smaller, more compact size compared to the typical walnut, with a more rounded crown and shorter branches. The leaves are typically broader and have a slightly different venation pattern than those of the standard Juglans regia. The fruit, or walnut, is generally smaller and has a thicker, more robust shell. It is valued for its high-quality nuts, which are used in culinary and commercial applications."
