    "intro": "Juncus stygius var. americanus, commonly known as the American rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in spikes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, often stabilizing soil in wetland areas. The leaves are narrow, cylindrical, and often have a bluish-green color, contributing to its ornamental appeal in wetland gardens."
