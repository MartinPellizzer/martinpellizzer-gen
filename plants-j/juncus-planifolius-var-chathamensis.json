    "intro": "Juncus planifolius var. chathamensis, commonly known as the Chatham rush, is a perennial plant native to the Chatham Islands of New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, typical of the Juncaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or wetland habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
