    "intro": "Jatropha gossypiifolia, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its spiny stems and leaves that are typically trifoliate, with three leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into orange or red berries containing toxic seeds. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in arid conditions. However, it is important to note that all parts of the plant are toxic and should be handled with care."
