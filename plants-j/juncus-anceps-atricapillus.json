    "intro": "Juncus anceps atricapillus, commonly known as the black-tipped rush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Juncaceae family and is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems covered in stiff, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and stream banks. Its unique black-tipped bracts distinguish it from other rush species and contribute to its ecological significance in riparian habitats."
