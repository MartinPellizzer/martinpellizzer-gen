    "intro": "Jurinea baissunensis, commonly known as the Baissun sandflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing annual herb with narrow, linear leaves adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
