    "intro": "Jubelina wilburii, commonly known as the Wilbur's juniper, is a rare and endangered species native to the western United States. It is a small evergreen shrub or tree that typically grows in rocky, arid environments. The plant has scale-like leaves that are dark green and closely arranged, and it produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans. Jubelina wilburii is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry conditions. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern."
