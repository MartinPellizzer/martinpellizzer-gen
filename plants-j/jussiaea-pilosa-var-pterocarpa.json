    "intro": "Jussiaea pilosa var. pterocarpa, commonly known as the broadleaf watermilfoil, is a perennial aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It has finely divided, feather-like leaves that float on the water surface, with shorter, root-like structures extending downward into the water. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late summer. It is often found in slow-moving or still waters such as ponds and lakes. Its dense growth can provide habitat for aquatic life but may also become invasive in certain regions."
