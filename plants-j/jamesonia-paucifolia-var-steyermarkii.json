    "intro": "Jamesonia paucifolia var. steyermarkii, commonly known as the Steyermark's false spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its attractive foliage and ability to form a dense ground cover."
