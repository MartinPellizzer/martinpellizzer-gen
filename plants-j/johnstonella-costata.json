It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland edges, stream banks, and meadows. The plant features slender, erect stems with opposite, lanceolate leaves that have serrated margins. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or red, blooming in late spring to early summer. Johnstonella costata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens."
