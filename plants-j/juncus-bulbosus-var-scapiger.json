It features tall, grass-like stems that are often reddish or brownish in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and colonize moist soils. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
