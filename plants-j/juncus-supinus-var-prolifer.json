    "intro": "Juncus supinus var. prolifer, commonly known as the spreading rush, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and its ability to form large clumps through vegetative propagation. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like clusters of greenish-white flowers, which appear in late spring to early summer. The species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and adaptability to various water conditions."
