    "intro": "Juncus multiceps, commonly known as the many-headed rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish flowers in late summer. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Juncus multiceps is also an important food source for various wildlife species, including waterfowl and invertebrates."
