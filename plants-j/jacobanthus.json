    "intro": "Jacobanthus, commonly known as the fairy lantern or bluebells, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae. These plants are native to South America and are characterized by their striking, bell-shaped flowers that come in shades of blue, purple, and white. Jacobanthus species are typically herbaceous perennials that produce showy, clustered blooms during the spring and summer seasons. They are often cultivated in gardens for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. The leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions."
