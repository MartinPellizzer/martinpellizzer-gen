    "intro": "Jacea erdneri, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool climates. The plant features a rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Its flowers are showy, bell-shaped, and come in shades of blue or violet, often with a yellow or orange throat. Jacea erdneri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
