    "intro": "Juncus spadiceus, commonly known as the green rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features tall, cylindrical stems that are often used in floral arrangements due to their elegant appearance. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of white or pale green flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil in marshy areas, making it ecologically significant. Juncus spadiceus thrives in moist to wet conditions and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along stream banks."
