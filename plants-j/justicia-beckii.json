    "intro": "Justicia beckii, commonly known as the red torchplant, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking red bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small white or yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Due to its vibrant appearance, it is often used in landscaping and as a cut flower."
