    "intro": "Jatropha schweinfurthii, commonly known as the Schweinfurth's physic nut, is a species of flowering plant in the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its spiny stems and palmate leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange-red berries containing toxic seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh conditions. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by herbivores, which helps it thrive in competitive ecosystems."
