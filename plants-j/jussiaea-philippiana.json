    "intro": "Jussiaea philippiana, commonly known as the Philippine water hyacinth, is a floating aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features broad, dark green, waxy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern on the water surface. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a purple tint at the base. It is adapted to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. However, it can become invasive in non-native regions, outcompeting native species for resources."
