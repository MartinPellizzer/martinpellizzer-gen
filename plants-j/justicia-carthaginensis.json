    "intro": "Justicia carthaginensis, commonly known as the crimson flame plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular red flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, especially hummingbirds, due to their bright color and nectar-rich structure."
