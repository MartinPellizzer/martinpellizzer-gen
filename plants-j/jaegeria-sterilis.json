    "intro": "Jaegeria sterilis, commonly known as the sterile jaegeria, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or riverbanks. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Jaegeria sterilis produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked, despite its ecological importance in supporting local insect populations."
