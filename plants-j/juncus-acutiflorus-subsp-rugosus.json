    "intro": "Juncus acutiflorus subsp. rugosus, commonly known as the rough spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in dense clusters, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with linear, grass-like leaves that are often rough to the touch. The plant produces tall, spike-like inflorescences bearing small, greenish flowers that are often obscured by bracts. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
