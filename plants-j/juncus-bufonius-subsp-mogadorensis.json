    "intro": "Juncus bufonius subsp. mogadorensis, commonly known as the Mogador rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
