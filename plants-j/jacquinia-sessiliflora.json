    "intro": "Jacquinia sessiliflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale blue flowers. It blooms from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a desirable plant for rock gardens and native plant landscapes."
