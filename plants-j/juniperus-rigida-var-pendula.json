    "intro": "Juniperus rigida var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping juniper, is a variant of the juniper shrub characterized by its pendulous growth habit. It features narrow, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, providing a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for various wildlife species. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature. This variety thrives in well-drained soils and is adaptable to a range of environmental conditions."
