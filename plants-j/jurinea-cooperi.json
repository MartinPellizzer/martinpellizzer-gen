It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial with silvery-gray foliage and showy, dandelion-like yellow flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and harsh coastal conditions. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Jurinea cooperi plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion in coastal ecosystems."
