    "intro": "Jurinea paphlagonica, commonly known as the Paphlagonian sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are typically succulent, helping it retain moisture in its native habitat. Jurinea paphlagonica is often found in steppe and semi-desert areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
