    "intro": "Jobinia, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical Africa. These plants are characterized by their compact growth habit and showy, velvety flowers that come in a variety of colors. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. Jobinia species are often cultivated as ornamental plants due to their attractive appearance and ability to thrive in indoor environments. They prefer bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
