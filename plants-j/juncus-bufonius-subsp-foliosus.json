    "intro": "Juncus bufonius subsp. foliosus, commonly known as the leafy rush, is a perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, ditches, and stream banks. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that are often leafy along their length, distinguishing it from other rush species. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
