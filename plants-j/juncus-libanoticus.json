It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found near streams, marshes, and waterlogged areas. The plant features tall, cylindrical stems covered in narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowering spikes produce small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Juncus libanoticus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
