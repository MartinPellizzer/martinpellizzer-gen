It features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairless, giving it its \"glabra\" designation. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in early summer, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Jasione montana f. glabra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
