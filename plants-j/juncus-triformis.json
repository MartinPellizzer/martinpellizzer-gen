    "intro": "Juncus triformis, commonly known as the three-angled rush, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that are often branched and covered in fine, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered in spike-like inflorescences, often appearing in late summer or early autumn. Juncus triformis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
