    "intro": "Juncus thomasii subsp. palensis, commonly known as Thomas's rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in riparian zones and wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of greenish-white flowers. It is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the structural complexity of its habitat. Its botanical features make it an important indicator species for wetland health and ecological restoration projects."
