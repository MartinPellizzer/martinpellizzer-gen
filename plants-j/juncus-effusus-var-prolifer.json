    "intro": "Juncus effusus var. prolifer, commonly known as the soft rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features tall, slender stems that grow in dense clusters, often reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes, pond edges, and damp woodlands. Its fibrous roots and ability to colonize disturbed soils make it an important pioneer species in wetland ecosystems."
