    "intro": "Juncus balticus var. columnaris, commonly known as the tall rush, is a perennial plant native to the wetlands of northern Europe and parts of Asia. It features tall, slender, grass-like stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, making it a striking feature in moist environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in spike-like clusters during the summer months. It thrives in shallow water or damp soil, often found along the edges of ponds, lakes, and marshes. Its dense growth habit makes it an effective natural stabilizer for shoreline vegetation."
