It is characterized by its dark green to reddish-brown stems, which are often covered in a layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, typically arranged in dense, cylindrical spikes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Its botanical features make it well adapted to cold climates and high-altitude environments."
