    "intro": "Juncus lampocarpus f. nanus, commonly known as the dwarf rush, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant belonging to the Juncaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves that are typically less than 30 centimeters in height. The plant produces small, greenish-brown flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, often appearing at the tips of the stems. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. This subspecies is notable for its compact size and adaptability to fluctuating water levels."
