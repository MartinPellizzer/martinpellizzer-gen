    "intro": "Jatropha elastica, commonly known as rubber plant or elephant's foot, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and distinctive, swollen, fleshy stems that store water, making it drought-tolerant. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by orange or red berries containing toxic seeds. Its latex sap, which is milky and sticky, has been used historically for various purposes, though it is not typically used for rubber production. Jatropha elastica thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
