    "intro": "Janusia linearifolia, commonly known as the slender leaf fern, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that arise from a creeping rhizome. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually dichotomously divided, giving it a feathery appearance. Janusia linearifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
