    "intro": "Juniperus quaternata, commonly known as the four-toothed juniper, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, providing a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife species. Juniperus quaternata thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude environments. Its hardy nature makes it a resilient plant in harsh, arid conditions."
