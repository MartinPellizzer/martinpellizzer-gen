    "intro": "Juniperus nana, commonly known as dwarf juniper, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of less than two feet, featuring dense, scale-like leaves that are dark green and aromatic. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. Juniperus nana thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a landscape ornamental. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in cold climates, contributing to its widespread cultivation in horticulture."
