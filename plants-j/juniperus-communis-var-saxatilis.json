    "intro": "Juniperus communis var. saxatilis, commonly known as the saxatile juniper, is a hardy evergreen shrub or small tree native to rocky and mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or coastal environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
