    "intro": "Justicia stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed flame flower, is a tropical perennial plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stem. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes in warm climates."
