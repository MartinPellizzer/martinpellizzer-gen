It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that can change color based on environmental conditions. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
