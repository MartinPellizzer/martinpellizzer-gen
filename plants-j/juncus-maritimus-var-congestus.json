    "intro": "Juncus maritimus var. congestus, commonly known as the clustered rush, is a perennial plant native to coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves that grow from a central stem. The plant typically thrives in moist, saline environments such as salt marshes and tidal flats. Its leaves are narrow and stiff, often reaching heights of up to 1 meter. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that develop into cylindrical seed heads, contributing to its role in stabilizing coastal soils."
