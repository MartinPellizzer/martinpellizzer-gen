    "intro": "Jacquinotia, commonly known as the mountain daisy, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Asteraceae family. These plants are native to the Andes Mountains in South America, where they thrive in high-altitude environments. Jacquinotia species are characterized by their compact growth habit, hairy stems, and showy yellow or orange flowers. They typically bloom in the summer months and are often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to their limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, many species of Jacquinotia are considered rare or endangered."
