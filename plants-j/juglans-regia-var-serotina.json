    "intro": "Juglans regia var. serotina, commonly known as the late-leafing walnut, is a variant of the Persian walnut. It is characterized by its delayed leafing habit, which sets it apart from other walnut species. The plant produces large, edible nuts enclosed in a thick, green husk. Its leaves are compound, with long petioles and serrated leaflets. This variety is valued for its hardy nature and potential for cultivation in temperate climates."
