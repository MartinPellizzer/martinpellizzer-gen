    "intro": "Justicia namatophila, commonly known as the velvetleaf false arum, is a striking tropical plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, pale greenish-white flowers that are arranged in a spadix, typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
