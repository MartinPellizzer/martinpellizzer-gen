    "intro": "Juncus caudatus, commonly known as the cat-tail rush, is a perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features tall, cylindrical spikelets that resemble a cat's tail, giving it its common name. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and grow in dense clusters. It thrives in moist to waterlogged soils and is often found along stream banks and in swampy regions. Juncus caudatus plays a vital role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
