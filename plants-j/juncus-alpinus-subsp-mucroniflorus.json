    "intro": "Juncus alpinus subsp. mucroniflorus, commonly known as the alpine rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, rocky or sandy soils in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets of greenish-white flowers. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in cold, harsh climates. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in mountainous areas."
