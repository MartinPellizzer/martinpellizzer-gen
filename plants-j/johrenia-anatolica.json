    "intro": "Johrenia anatolica, commonly known as Anatolian broomrape, is a parasitic plant native to Turkey. It lacks chlorophyll and therefore cannot perform photosynthesis, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or green. It is often found growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem, though it is not widely cultivated or studied."
