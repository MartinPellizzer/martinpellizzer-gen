    "intro": "Juniperus scopulorum var. repens, commonly known as creeping juniper, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces tiny, blue or black berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil, it is commonly used in landscaping and erosion control."
