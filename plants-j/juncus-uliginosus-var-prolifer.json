    "intro": "Juncus uliginosus var. prolifer, commonly known as the marsh rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves that grow from a rhizomatous base. The plant produces spikes of small, greenish flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to water-saturated soils, often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. This variant is noted for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, contributing to its dense growth habit in wetland habitats."
