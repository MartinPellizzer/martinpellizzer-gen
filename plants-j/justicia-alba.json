    "intro": "Justicia alba, commonly known as whiteleaf false arum, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking white, showy bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in a spadix, typical of the Araceae family. Its leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Justicia alba thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks."
