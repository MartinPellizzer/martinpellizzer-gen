    "intro": "Jasminum floribundum f. decipiens, commonly known as the false jasmine or deceptive jasmine, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southern China. It features small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often mistaken for true jasmine due to their similar appearance. The plant has opposite, simple, ovate leaves with a glossy surface and dark green color. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for gardens and containers. Its ornamental value lies in its pleasant scent and delicate floral display."
