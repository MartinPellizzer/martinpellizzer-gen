    "intro": "Jeffreycia usambarensis, commonly known as the Usambarensis sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features upright, branching stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often hairy. It produces vibrant yellow-orange ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
