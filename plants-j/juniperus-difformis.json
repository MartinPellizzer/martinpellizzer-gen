    "intro": "Juniperus difformis, commonly known as the twisted juniper, is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its irregular, twisted growth habit and needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Juniperus difformis plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat in its native ecosystems."
