    "intro": "Jatropha marmorata, commonly known as the marbleleaf jatropha, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, mottled leaves that display a mix of green, white, and purple hues. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by orange or red berries containing toxic seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though caution is advised due to the toxicity of its parts."
