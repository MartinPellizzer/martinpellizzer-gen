    "intro": "Jussiaea decumbens, commonly known as the creeping willow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in South America. It typically grows in marshy areas and along the edges of water bodies, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features a prostrate growth habit with slender, branching stems that often root at the nodes. Its small, opposite leaves are lance-shaped and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Jussiaea decumbens produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer."
