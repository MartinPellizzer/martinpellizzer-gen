    "intro": "Juniperus chinensis var. aureoglobosa, commonly known as the golden globe juniper, is a compact, slow-growing shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its dense, spherical form and bright golden-yellow foliage, which contrasts sharply with its dark green needles. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to tolerate urban conditions."
