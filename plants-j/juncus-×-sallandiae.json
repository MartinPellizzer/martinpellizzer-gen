    "intro": "Juncus \u00d7 sallandiae, commonly known as the Sallandia rush, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Juncus effuses and Juncus tenuis. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia, typically found in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, ditches, and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often green or reddish in color. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in waterlogged soils, making it a useful plant for wetland restoration projects."
