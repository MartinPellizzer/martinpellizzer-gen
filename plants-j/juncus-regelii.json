    "intro": "Juncus regelii, commonly known as the Regel's rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams, thriving in moist to water-saturated soils. The plant features tall, cylindrical stems that are often reddish or purplish in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences composed of numerous tiny greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Juncus regelii is valued in ecological restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity."
