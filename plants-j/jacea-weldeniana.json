    "intro": "Jacea weldeniana, commonly known as the woolly jacea, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant is characterized by its hairy, woolly leaves and stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Jacea weldeniana is typically found in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates."
