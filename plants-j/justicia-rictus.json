    "intro": "Justicia rictus, commonly known as the red-hot cat's tail, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, vibrant red bracts that resemble a cat's tail, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, clustered at the base of the bracts. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Justicia rictus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can be grown as a houseplant or in gardens with appropriate care."
