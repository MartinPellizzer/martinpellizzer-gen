    "intro": "Juniperus sargentii, commonly known as Sargent's juniper, is a species of coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, and its small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and open woodlands. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Juniperus sargentii is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardiness and distinctive appearance."
