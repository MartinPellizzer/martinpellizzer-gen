    "intro": "Juncus oxymeris, commonly known as the narrowleaf rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in the eastern United States. It typically grows in dense clusters, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with slender, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in spike-like clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and arranged in two rows along the stem. Juncus oxymeris plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
