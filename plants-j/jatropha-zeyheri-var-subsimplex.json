    "intro": "Jatropha zeyheri var. subsimplex, commonly known as the Cape gooseberry or Physalis, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny calyx that encloses the fruit, which resembles a small, orange berry. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are typically ovate with a rough texture. The fruit is edible when ripe, though the plant is toxic when unripe. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and semi-arid regions."
