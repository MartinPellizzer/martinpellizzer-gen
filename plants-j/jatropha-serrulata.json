The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into capsule fruits containing toxic seeds. Jatropha serrulata is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in arid or semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and potential applications in biofuel research."
