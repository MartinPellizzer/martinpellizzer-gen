    "intro": "Juniperus deltoides, commonly known as the desert juniper, is a hardy evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its scale-like leaves that are arranged in flat, sprout-like clusters, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for various birds and wildlife. It is well adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in dry conditions. The plant's aromatic foliage and resilience make it a common component of desert landscapes."
