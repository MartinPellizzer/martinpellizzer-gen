    "intro": "Jacobaea lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, flat-topped clusters called cymes. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Jacobaea lanuginosa is often found in regions with low rainfall and well-drained soils."
