    "intro": "Jurinea cynaroides, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean and the Middle East, where it thrives in saline and sandy soils. The plant features striking blue to violet ray florets surrounded by pale yellow disk florets, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are typically silver-gray with a fuzzy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Jurinea cynaroides is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
