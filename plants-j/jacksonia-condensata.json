    "intro": "Jacksonia condensata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flax, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the daisy family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, pale yellow to orange flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as scrublands and coastal dunes. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance. However, it is also considered a potential weed in some regions due to its rapid spread."
