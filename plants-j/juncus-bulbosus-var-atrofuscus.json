It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams, thriving in moist to water-saturated soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that are dark green to black in color, giving it its distinctive appearance. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pale green to yellowish, appearing in late summer to early fall. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture, contributing to its adaptability in wetland ecosystems."
