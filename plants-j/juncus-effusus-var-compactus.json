    "intro": "Juncus effusus var. compactus, commonly known as the compact rush, is a dense, clump-forming perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bright green and arranged in tight, compact tufts. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and shaded garden areas. Its compact growth habit makes it an excellent choice for erosion control and ornamental landscaping."
