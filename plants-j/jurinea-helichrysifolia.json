    "intro": "Jurinea helichrysifolia, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand salty sea breezes and harsh coastal conditions. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscaping. Jurinea helichrysifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
