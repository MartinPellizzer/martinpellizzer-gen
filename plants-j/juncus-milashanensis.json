    "intro": "Juncus milashanensis, commonly known as the Milashan rush, is a perennial plant native to eastern Asia, particularly China. It belongs to the Juncaceae family and is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to waterlogged soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. The plant's rhizomes are often harvested for their medicinal properties, which include anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic effects."
