    "intro": "Jacksonia dumosa var. glabrata, commonly known as the glabrous sand everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white ray florets surrounded by yellow disk florets, giving it a delicate, daisy-like appearance. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid environments. The leaves are linear, grey-green, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss."
