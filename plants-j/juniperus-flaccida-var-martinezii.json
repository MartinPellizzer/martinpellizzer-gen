    "intro": "Juniperus flaccida var. martinezii, commonly known as the Martinez's creeping juniper, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, providing a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are usually blue or black when mature. It is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils. Its compact form and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
