    "intro": "Jasminum rupestre var. contractum, commonly known as the compact jasmine or dwarf rock jasmine, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves and is well adapted to rocky or dry soils. It is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for container gardening as well."
