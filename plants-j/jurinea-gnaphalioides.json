    "intro": "Jurinea gnaphalioides, commonly known as the silverleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It features a dense mat of silver-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine, silky hairs that reflect sunlight. Jurinea gnaphalioides is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and sagebrush habitats."
