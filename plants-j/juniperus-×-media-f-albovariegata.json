    "intro": "Juniperus \u00d7 media f. albovariegata, commonly known as the white-veined juniper, is a compact, evergreen shrub or small tree characterized by its slow growth and dense, conical form. Its foliage consists of scale-like leaves that are typically dark green with striking white or yellow variegation, adding visual interest to landscapes. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a foundation plant. This cultivar is prized for its aesthetic appeal and hardiness in temperate climates."
