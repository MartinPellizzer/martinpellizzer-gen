    "intro": "Jacea carpetana, commonly known as the mountain gentian, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. Jacea carpetana plays an important role in alpine ecosystems, providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small invertebrates."
