    "intro": "Jonesiopsis occidentalis, commonly known as the western jonesiopsis, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, delicate leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces tiny, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the carrot family. It is native to specific regions in South America and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
