    "intro": "Jacquemontia evolvuloides f. hirsutula, commonly known as the hairy jacquemontia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family, characterized by its climbing or trailing growth habit. The plant features heart-shaped, hairy leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of white to pink. Its hirsutula form is distinguished by its dense, woolly pubescence, which covers the stems and leaves. This botanical variation contributes to its unique appearance and ecological adaptations."
