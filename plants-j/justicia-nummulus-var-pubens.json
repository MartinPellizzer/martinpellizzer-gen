    "intro": "Justicia nummulus var. pubens, commonly known as the velvetleaf false heather, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a velvety texture due to the dense covering of fine hairs. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a container plant. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade conditions."
