    "intro": "Jamesonia blepharum, commonly known as the western star moss, is a low-growing evergreen plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant features small, dark green leaves that are tightly clustered around its stems, giving it a moss-like appearance. It produces delicate white or pale yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in umbels. Jamesonia blepharum is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in open woodlands and mountainous regions."
