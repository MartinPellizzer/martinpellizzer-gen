    "intro": "Jatropha macrorhiza, commonly known as the broadroot spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange or red berries containing toxic seeds. It is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
