    "intro": "Jansenia, commonly known as the orchid of the genus Jansenia, is a group of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and are characterized by their striking, often fragrant flowers. Jansenia species typically have showy, brightly colored blooms with intricate patterns, making them popular among horticulturists and plant enthusiasts. They are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on other plants or rocks, and require specific humidity and light conditions to thrive. Due to their rarity and habitat specificity, many Jansenia species are considered endangered and are protected in their native environments."
