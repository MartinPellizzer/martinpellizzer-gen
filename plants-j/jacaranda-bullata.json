    "intro": "Jacaranda bullata, commonly known as the silky jacaranda, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its striking clusters of pale blue to purple flowers that appear in late winter to early spring. The leaves are bipinnate, consisting of multiple pairs of small, feather-like leaflets. The tree produces small, woody pods that contain seeds, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and urban landscapes."
