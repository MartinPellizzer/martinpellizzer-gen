It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet, featuring lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom from late spring to early fall.

Its adaptability to various soil types and drought tolerance also make it a resilient choice for landscaping."
