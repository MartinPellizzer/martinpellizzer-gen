    "intro": "Jatropha obtusifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved physic nut, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and broad, ovate leaves with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers that give way to orange-red berries containing toxic seeds. Jatropha obtusifolia is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in arid or semi-arid environments. It is also known for its potential use in biofuel production due to its high oil content in the seeds."
