    "intro": "Juncus leucochlamys subsp. borealis, commonly known as the northern marsh rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the northern regions of North America. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, cylindrical leaves and produces small, white or pale green spikelets that are clustered at the ends of its stems. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in poorly drained soils and its tolerance to cold temperatures. This subspecies plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
