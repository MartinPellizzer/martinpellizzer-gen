    "intro": "Juniperus excelsa var. polycarpos, commonly known as the Himalayan juniper, is a coniferous shrub or small tree native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, which consists of scale-like leaves arranged in dense, flat sprays. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are borne in cone-like structures, typical of the Cupressaceae family. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or mountainous terrain. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and aesthetic features."
