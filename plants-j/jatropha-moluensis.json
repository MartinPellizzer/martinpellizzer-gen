    "intro": "Jatropha moluensis, commonly known as the African croton, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain toxic seeds, which are not suitable for human consumption. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and savannas. Jatropha moluensis is also noted for its ornamental value and has been studied for potential use in agroforestry systems."
