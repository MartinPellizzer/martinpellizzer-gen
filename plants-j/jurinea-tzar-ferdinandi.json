    "intro": "Jurinea tzar-ferdinandi, commonly known as the Tzar Ferdinand's sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flower heads surrounded by white, woolly bracts. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. It is a hardy perennial that blooms in late spring to early summer."
