    "intro": "Juniperus erythrocarpa var. coahuilensis, commonly known as the Coahuila juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the Chihuahuan Desert in northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, demonstrating remarkable adaptability to harsh desert conditions. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes."
