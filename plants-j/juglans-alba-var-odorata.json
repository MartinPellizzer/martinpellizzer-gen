It is characterized by its smooth, light-colored bark and large, heart-shaped leaves. The tree produces round, green fruits that turn yellow or brown when mature. Its flowers are dioecious, with separate male and female plants, and it relies on wind pollination. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and the edible, nut-like seeds it produces."
