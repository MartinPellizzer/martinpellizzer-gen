    "intro": "Jussiaea suffruticosa var. octonervia, commonly known as the eight-veined jussiaea, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a shrub characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, opposite leaves with a prominent venation pattern. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom during the wet season. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in swampy or seasonally flooded areas. Its botanical features make it an important species in the study of aquatic and semi-aquatic plant adaptations."
