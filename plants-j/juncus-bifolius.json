    "intro": "Juncus bifolius, commonly known as the two-leaved rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clumps of grass-like foliage. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color and bear small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with two distinct leaf blades emerging from each node. Juncus bifolius plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
