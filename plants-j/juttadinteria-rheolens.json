    "intro": "Juttadinteria rheolens, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers with five petals, which bloom during the rainy season. Its roots are deep and extensive, helping it access moisture from underground water sources. Juttadinteria rheolens is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in drought-tolerant gardens."
