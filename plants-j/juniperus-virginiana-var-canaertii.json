    "intro": "Juniperus virginiana var. canaertii, commonly known as the smooth juniper, is a variant of the eastern red cedar. It is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. The plant features scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and whitish underneath, providing a striking visual contrast. Its cones are small and berry-like, containing toxic seeds that are not typically consumed by humans. The smooth juniper is valued for its aromatic wood and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
