    "intro": "Jejewoodia jongirii, commonly known as the rare and endemic plant of the eastern Himalayas, is a shrub characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of pale yellow flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments at high altitudes, typically between 2,000 and 3,500 meters. The plant has a woody stem with a rough, bark-like texture and produces small, elliptical fruits that contain several seeds. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in alpine regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes."
