    "intro": "Juniperus reflexa, commonly known as the creeping juniper, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. Juniperus reflexa is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soils. Its botanical features make it well-suited for rock gardens and as a ground cover in arid environments."
