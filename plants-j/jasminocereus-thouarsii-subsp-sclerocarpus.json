    "intro": "Jasminocereus thouarsii subsp. sclerocarpus, commonly known as the desert night-blooming cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are ribbed and covered in spines, adapted for water storage and protection. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system to maximize water absorption. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh environments."
