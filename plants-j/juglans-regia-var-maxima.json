    "intro": "Juglans regia var. maxima, commonly known as the Persian walnut, is a variant of the common walnut native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its large, thick-shelled nuts and robust, deciduous foliage. The tree can grow up to 20 meters tall, with a broad, spreading crown and deep, fibrous roots. Its leaves are doubly pinnate, with long, slender leaflets that turn yellow in autumn. The fruit, which matures in late summer, is highly valued for its rich, oily kernels used in culinary and medicinal applications."
