    "intro": "Janusia guaranitica f. glabrata, commonly known as the smoothleaf janusia, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its glabrous (smooth) leaves and showy, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in clusters. Native to specific regions of South America, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests. Its botanical features include hairy stems that become smooth with age and elliptical leaves with a slightly waxy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
