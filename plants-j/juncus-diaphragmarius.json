    "intro": "Juncus diaphragmarius, commonly known as the diaphragm rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clusters of grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas effectively. Juncus diaphragmarius plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and semi-aquatic wildlife."
