    "intro": "Juncus acutus var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal rush, is a perennial plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that grow in dense clusters, typically reaching heights of 30 to 60 centimeters. This variety thrives in wet or brackish environments, such as marshes, estuaries, and tidal flats, where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various organisms. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming extensive mats that help prevent erosion. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring or early summer, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences."
