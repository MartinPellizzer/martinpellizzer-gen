    "intro": "Jupunba microcalyx var. parauaquarae, commonly known as the Parauaquara jupunba, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Brazilian state of Par\u00e1. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology. The plant features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a subtle fragrance. Its leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth texture and a slightly hairy underside. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this variant is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
