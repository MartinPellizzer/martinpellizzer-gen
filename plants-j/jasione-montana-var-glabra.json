    "intro": "Jasione montana var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth rock jasmine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that are often hairy, with small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically smooth on the upper surface. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers in early summer, which are borne on short pedicels. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its compact growth and ornamental flowers, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
