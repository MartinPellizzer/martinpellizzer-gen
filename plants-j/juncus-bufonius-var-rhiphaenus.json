    "intro": "Juncus bufonius var. rhiphaenus, commonly known as the water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features tall, cylindrical stems that are often hollow and covered with fine, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to reddish flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist to aquatic environments, such as marshes, swamps, and the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland ecosystems."
