It is characterized by its striking, large, and showy flowers that are typically pink or white in color. The plant has a unique structure with a single, elongated flower that emerges from a leaf-like bract. Joannesia princeps is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
