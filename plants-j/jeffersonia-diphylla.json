    "intro": "Jeffersonia diphylla, commonly known as the Jeffersonia, is a rare and delicate herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the\u7f42\u7c9f\u79d1 (Papaveraceae) family and is characterized by its two distinct leaf types, from which its scientific name is derived. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its showy, nodding flowers are usually pink or white, appearing in early spring. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, Jeffersonia diphylla is considered a conservation concern."
