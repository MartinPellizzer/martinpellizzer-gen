It typically grows in dense stands in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that are often reddish or purplish in color, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and they are often covered in a fine layer of wax. This species plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
