    "intro": "Jatropha gossypiifolia var. ribifolia, commonly known as the red-veined jatropha, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves with prominent red veins, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into orange-red berries containing toxic seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along forest edges. Due to its ornamental value and toxic properties, it is sometimes cultivated as a garden plant but requires caution when handling."
