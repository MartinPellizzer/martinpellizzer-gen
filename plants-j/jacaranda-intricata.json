    "intro": "Jacaranda intricata, commonly known as the lacebark jacaranda, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to South Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive and ornamental appearance. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pale purple flowers during the late winter to early spring season. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a feathery, finely divided appearance. Jacaranda intricata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to warm, sunny climates."
