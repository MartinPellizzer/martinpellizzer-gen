    "intro": "Janipha angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf janipha, is a flowering plant native to specific regions in Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in its native range."
