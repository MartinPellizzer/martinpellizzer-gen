    "intro": "Juncus alpinus subsp. arthrophyllus, commonly known as the alpine rush, is a perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, which are typically found at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to cold climates and can tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
