It is native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica and Panama, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Jaltomata pauciseminata is notable for its limited seed production, which is a characteristic reflected in its common name."
