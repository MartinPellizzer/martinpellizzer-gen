    "intro": "Juncus alpinoarticulatus subsp. rariflorus, commonly known as the alpine rush, is a perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky or alpine habitats, often forming dense mats in its native environment. Its leaves are narrow and cylindrical, often with a waxy surface to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to cold climates and its role in stabilizing soil in mountainous regions."
