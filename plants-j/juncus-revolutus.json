    "intro": "Juncus revolutus, commonly known as the rolled rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It typically grows in dense clusters, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with slender, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of pale green to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often rolled at the edges, giving it its common name. Juncus revolutus plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
