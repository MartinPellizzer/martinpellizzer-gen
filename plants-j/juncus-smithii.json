    "intro": "Juncus smithii, commonly known as Smith's rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of greenish-white flowers. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water. Juncus smithii is an important component of riparian and wetland ecosystems."
