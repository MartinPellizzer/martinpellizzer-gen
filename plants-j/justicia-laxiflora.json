    "intro": "Justicia laxiflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved jewelweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial that produces striking, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant features opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves and has a hairy stem that helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are borne in clusters at the ends of the stems, and they attract a variety of pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is often found in moist, sunny habitats like woodland edges and disturbed soils."
