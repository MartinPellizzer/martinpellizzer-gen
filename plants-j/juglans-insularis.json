    "intro": "Juglans insularis, commonly known as the island walnut, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Guam in the Mariana archipelago. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive, edible nuts enclosed in a thick, woody husk. The plant thrives in tropical rainforest environments and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of its island habitat. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female inflorescences, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, Juglans insularis is considered critically endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
