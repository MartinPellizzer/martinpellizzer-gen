    "intro": "Jurinea propinqua, commonly known as the narrowleaf sea rocket, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments. Jurinea propinqua is adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a hardy species of the coastal flora."
