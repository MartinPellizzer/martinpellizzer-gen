    "intro": "Justicia bojeriana, commonly known as the flame flower, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a flowering shrub that produces vibrant, showy inflorescences of red, orange, or yellow flowers, which bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its colorful blooms. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Justicia bojeriana is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
