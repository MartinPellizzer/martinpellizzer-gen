    "intro": "Jurinea dobrogensis, commonly known as the Dobrogian sandflower, is a flowering plant native to the steppes of Eastern Europe and parts of the Caucasus. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in dry, sandy soils, often found in open habitats such as dunes and grasslands. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white flowers arranged in a dense, compact inflorescence. Its leaves are narrow, hairy, and adapted to reduce water loss, reflecting its arid environment. Jurinea dobrogensis is characterized by its resilience to harsh conditions and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
