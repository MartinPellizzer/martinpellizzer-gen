It is native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. The plant is characterized by its spineless stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It has adapted to survive in harsh desert conditions with minimal water requirements. Its unique morphology makes it an interesting subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
