    "intro": "Jamesonia retrofracta, commonly known as the rock mullein, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, velvety leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a raceme at the top of the stem. Its roots are fibrous and can be used in traditional herbal medicine. Jamesonia retrofracta thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments."
