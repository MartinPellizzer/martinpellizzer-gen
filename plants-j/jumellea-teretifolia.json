    "intro": "Jumellea teretifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf jumellea, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It features small, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping."
