    "intro": "Jurinea krascheninnikovii, commonly known as the Arctic sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, white or pink flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in its harsh, cold environment. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Its adaptations make it well-suited for survival in extreme climates with short growing seasons."
