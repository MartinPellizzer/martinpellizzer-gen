    "intro": "Juniperus barbadensis var. barbadensis, commonly known as the Barbados juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean islands. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that forms compact, spherical clusters. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are often used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring in beverages. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils. The leaves are needle-like and have a fragrant, resinous scent, typical of many juniper species."
