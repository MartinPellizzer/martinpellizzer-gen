    "intro": "Johnstonia axilliflora, commonly known as the axillary-flowered johnstonia, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a woody stem with dense, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which bloom in the early spring. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, and it thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Johnstonia axilliflora is considered a conservation concern."
