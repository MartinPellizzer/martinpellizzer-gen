    "intro": "Jatropha crinita, commonly known as the curlyleaf spurge, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, reddish stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into orange or red berries containing toxic seeds. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a weed and should be handled with care."
