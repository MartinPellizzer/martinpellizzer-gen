    "intro": "Jonesiopsis wanosa, commonly known as the Wanosa fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, lanceolate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams, where it attaches to submerged rocks or vegetation. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. Jonesiopsis wanosa is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in maintaining aquatic ecosystem balance."
