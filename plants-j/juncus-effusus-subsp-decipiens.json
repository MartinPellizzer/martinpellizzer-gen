    "intro": "Juncus effusus subsp. decipiens, commonly known as the false rush, is a perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Juncaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that forms compact clumps. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, typically arranged in spike-like clusters. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, ditches, and the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive colonies in suitable environments."
