    "intro": "Juncus andinus, commonly known as the Andean rush, is a perennial plant native to the Andes region of South America. It is characterized by its dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves and its ability to thrive in wet or moist environments. The plant typically grows in high-altitude areas, often near streams or in mountainous regions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form extensive colonies, contributing to soil stabilization. Juncus andinus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
