    "intro": "Justicia wittei, commonly known as the velvetleaf false arum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are often tinged with purple or red, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that are borne on slender, erect spikes. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in humid conditions. However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
