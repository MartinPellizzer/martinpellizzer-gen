    "intro": "Juno furseorum, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are covered in a dense layer of golden, fuzzy hairs. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Juno furseorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
