It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale yellow. The plant has simple, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
