    "intro": "Juniperus przewalskii, commonly known as the Przewalski juniper, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves and small, blue-black berries that are typically retained on the plant for several years. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. It has a slow growth rate and can live for many decades, making it a long-lived species in its native habitat. The Przewalski juniper is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
