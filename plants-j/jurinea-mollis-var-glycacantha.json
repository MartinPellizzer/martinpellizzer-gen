It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring and early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. Its adaptability to coastal conditions makes it an important component of maritime flora."
