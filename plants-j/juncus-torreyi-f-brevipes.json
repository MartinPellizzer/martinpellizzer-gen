    "intro": "Juncus torreyi f. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed rush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Juncaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swales, and streambanks. Its inflorescence consists of small, spike-like clusters of greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The short-stemmed form distinguishes it from other varieties within the Juncus torreyi species complex."
