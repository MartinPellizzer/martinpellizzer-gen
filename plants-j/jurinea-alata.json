    "intro": "Jurinea alata, commonly known as the silverleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, waxy hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Jurinea alata is often found in coastal dunes, rocky outcrops, and other harsh environments."
