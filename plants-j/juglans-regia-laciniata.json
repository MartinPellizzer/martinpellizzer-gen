    "intro": "Juglans regia laciniata, commonly known as the Persian walnut or split-leaf walnut, is a variant of the Persian walnut tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its broad, deeply lobed leaves that give it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The tree produces large, edible nuts encased in a thick, green husk that splits open when mature. Its fruit is typically harvested in the fall and is prized for its rich, oily kernel. This species is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and carving."
