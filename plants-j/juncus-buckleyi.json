    "intro": "Juncus buckleyi, commonly known as Buckley's rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Juncaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of grass-like leaves and spikes of small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks, wetlands, and disturbed areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Buckley's rush is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in wetland environments."
