    "intro": "Jatropha villosa var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth jatropha, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Americas. It is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and leaves, which contrast with the typical pubescent features of the species. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing toxic seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
