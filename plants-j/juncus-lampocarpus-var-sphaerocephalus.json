It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves and produces small, white to pink flowers in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its unique floral structure and compact growth habit make it an attractive addition to native plant gardens. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining wetland ecosystems."
