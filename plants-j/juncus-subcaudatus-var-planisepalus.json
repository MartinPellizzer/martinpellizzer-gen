    "intro": "Juncus subcaudatus var. planisepalus, commonly known as the broadleaf rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves that are typically flat and wide, growing in dense clumps. The plant produces spikes of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it ecologically important in wetland ecosystems."
