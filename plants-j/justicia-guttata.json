    "intro": "Justicia guttata, commonly known as the spotted jewelweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking, orange-red bracts that resemble small flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are heart-shaped, hairy, and have a distinctive reddish or purple tinge along the veins. Justicia guttata thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
