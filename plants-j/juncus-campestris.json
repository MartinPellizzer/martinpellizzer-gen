    "intro": "Juncus campestris, commonly known as the common rush, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a cylindrical stem. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, wetlands, and along the edges of ponds. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like clusters of greenish-white flowers that appear in late spring to early summer. Juncus campestris plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
