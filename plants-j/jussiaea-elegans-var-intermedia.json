It is a perennial herb that typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, characterized by its linear, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers arranged in clusters, which are often submerged or floating. It thrives in environments with moderate to high light and requires consistent moisture for optimal growth. Jussiaea elegans var. intermedia is valued in aquatic gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting waterfowl and invertebrates."
