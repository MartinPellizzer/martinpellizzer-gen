    "intro": "Jussiaea suffruticosa subsp. octonervia, commonly known as the eight-veined jussiaea, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, opposite leaves with eight distinct veins. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
