    "intro": "Jatropha papyrifera, commonly known as the paper plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves that resemble folded paper, giving it its common name. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing toxic seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, though the plant is generally considered poisonous. Jatropha papyrifera is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and as a decorative plant."
