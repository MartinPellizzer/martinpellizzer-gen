    "intro": "Juncus capensis subsp. parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as along riverbanks and in swampy areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish flowers arranged in spikes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in suitable habitats. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
