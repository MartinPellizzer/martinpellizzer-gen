    "intro": "Juncus tenuis var. congestus, commonly known as the dense rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features slender, grass-like stems that grow in dense clusters, often reaching heights of 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences composed of numerous tiny, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This species is adapted to moist or submerged soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
