    "intro": "Jaltomata bohsiana, commonly known as the Bohsian groundcherry, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to the western United States, particularly California, and thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange berries that are edible when ripe, though they are often covered in a sticky, resinous substance. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with hairy surfaces, and it typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters. Jaltomata bohsiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
