    "intro": "Jacksonia racemosa var. pubiflora, commonly known as the hairy leek or New Zealand leek, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the daisy family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its long, narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils. It is often found in open habitats such as dunes and cliffs, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained conditions. The variety pubiflora is distinguished by its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment."
