    "intro": "Jacquemontia evolvuloides var. tweediei, commonly known as the Tweedie's morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped, pale blue to lavender flowers. The plant produces distinctive, spiral-shaped seed pods that enclose its seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
