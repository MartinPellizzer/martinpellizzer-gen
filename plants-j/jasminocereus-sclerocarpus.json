    "intro": "Jasminocereus sclerocarpus, commonly known as the desert night-blooming cereus, is a cacti species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny stems and nocturnal flowering habit, with large, fragrant white flowers that open at night. The plant has a globular or cylindrical shape, often with a ribbed structure that helps it store water efficiently. Its flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a single night, and are pollinated by nocturnal insects such as moths. The plant is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, with a deep root system and a slow growth rate."
