    "intro": "Juniperus sheppardii var. torulosa, commonly known as the Utah juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, scaly foliage and small, berry-like cones that are typically blue or whitish in color. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. Its leaves are scale-like and closely pressed to the branches, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. The Utah juniper is an important component of the desert ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
