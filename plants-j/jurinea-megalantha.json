    "intro": "Jurinea megalantha, commonly known as the giant sandflower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including strong winds and salt spray. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Jurinea megalantha plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
