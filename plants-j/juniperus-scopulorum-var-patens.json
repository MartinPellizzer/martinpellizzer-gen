    "intro": "Juniperus scopulorum var. patens, commonly known as the creeping juniper, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and arid environments. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for erosion control and ornamental landscaping."
