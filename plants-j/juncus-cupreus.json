    "intro": "Juncus cupreus, commonly known as copper rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features tall, cylindrical stems that are typically reddish-brown in color, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, which are usually greenish or brownish in hue. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slight sheen. Juncus cupreus is adapted to moist or aquatic environments and plays a role in stabilizing shoreline soils."
