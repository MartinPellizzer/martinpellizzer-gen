    "intro": "Jasminocereus galapagensis, commonly known as the Gal\u00e1pagos jasmine cactus, is a unique cactus species native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom at night. The plant has adapted to the arid climate of the islands with thick, fleshy stems that store water. Its flowers emit a sweet scent, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. This species plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is considered a symbol of the Gal\u00e1pagos' unique biodiversity."
