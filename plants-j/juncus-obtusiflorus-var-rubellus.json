    "intro": "Juncus obtusiflorus var. rubellus, commonly known as the red-flowered rush, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of bright red or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist to water-saturated soils. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often form a rosette at the base. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
