    "intro": "Jatropha hildebrandtii var. hildebrandtii, commonly known as the Hildebrandt's physic nut, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by distinctive orange-red berries containing toxic seeds. It is adapted to grow in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
