    "intro": "Juncus vacillans, commonly known as the wavering rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense stands that help stabilize shoreline areas. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often reddish or purplish in color, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of brownish flowers. It is adapted to fluctuating water levels, making it resilient in marshy habitats. Juncus vacillans plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
