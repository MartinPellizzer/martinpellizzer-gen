It is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely covered with fine, soft hairs, giving it a soft, textured appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in spikes during the summer months. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in moist environments."
