    "intro": "Juniperus coxii, commonly known as the Coxi juniper, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves and small, blue-gray berries that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters. Its cones, which mature over two years, are an important feature in its reproductive cycle. Juniperus coxii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh environmental conditions."
