    "intro": "Jurinea granitica, commonly known as the granite sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky environments. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of tiny, white or pale blue flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, nutrient-poor soils, often found on gravelly slopes and in desert regions. Its succulent leaves help it retain water, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Jurinea granitica plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme conditions."
