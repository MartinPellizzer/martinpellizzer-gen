    "intro": "Jovibarba arenaria subsp. pseudohirta, commonly known as the sandstone hawksbeard, is a perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its compact rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. This subspecies is adapted to rocky, arid environments, often found on sandstone outcrops. Its leaves are typically covered with fine, glandular hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant is relatively hardy and thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure."
