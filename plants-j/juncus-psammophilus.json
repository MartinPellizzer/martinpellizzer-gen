    "intro": "Juncus psammophilus, commonly known as the sand junegrass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a perennial grass-like plant that thrives in sandy soils and is often found in dunes and coastal areas. The plant has slender, grass-like stems that are often hairy and can grow up to 30 centimeters in height. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically arranged in spikes and are wind-pollinated. Juncus psammophilus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing erosion."
