    "intro": "Juncus balticus var. inundatus, commonly known as the Baltic rush, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in northern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers. The plant thrives in saturated soils and is often found in marshes, pond margins, and along slow-moving waterways. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial organisms. This variant is distinguished by its shorter, more compact stature compared to other juncus species."
