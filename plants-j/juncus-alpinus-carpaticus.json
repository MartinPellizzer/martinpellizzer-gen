    "intro": "Juncus alpinus carpaticus, commonly known as the alpine rush, is a perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and tall, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in alpine and subalpine environments. It is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate frost and snow cover. Juncus alpinus carpaticus plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky and high-altitude habitats."
