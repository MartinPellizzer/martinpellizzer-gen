It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves that form a compact rosette. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in a spike at the top of the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and wetland conservation."
