    "intro": "Juniperus japonica, commonly known as Japanese juniper, is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, arranged in dense clusters. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for various climates. Juniperus japonica is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and resilience."
