    "intro": "Juncus khasiensis, commonly known as the Khasi rush, is a flowering plant native to the northeastern region of India, particularly in the states of Meghalaya, Assam, and Arunachal Pradesh. It belongs to the family Juncaceae and is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, wetland habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and roadside ditches. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or brown in color, arranged in spike-like inflorescences. Juncus khasiensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland areas and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
