    "intro": "Juniperus rufescens var. brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved red juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, providing a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, dry environments. This variety is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
