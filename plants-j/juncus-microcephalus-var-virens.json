    "intro": "Juncus microcephalus var. virens, commonly known as green-headed rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features slender, grass-like stems that are typically bright green, with small, clustered spikelets that turn greenish or brown as they mature. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. Its dense growth habit makes it useful for erosion control and habitat creation for aquatic wildlife. The flowering period usually occurs in late spring to early summer, adding a subtle ornamental value to wetland landscapes."
