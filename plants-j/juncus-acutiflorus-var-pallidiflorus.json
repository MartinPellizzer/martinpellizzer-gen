It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, pale yellow to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments such as wetlands, marshes, and streambanks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming dense clumps. This variety is distinguished by its pale flower color, which sets it apart from other juncus species."
