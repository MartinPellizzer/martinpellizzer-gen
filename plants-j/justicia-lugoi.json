    "intro": "Justicia lugoi, commonly known as the silverleaf justicia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, pubescent hairs. The plant produces clusters of showy, tubular flowers in shades of blue, violet, or white, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its drought tolerance, it is often used in xeriscaping and landscape design in arid climates."
