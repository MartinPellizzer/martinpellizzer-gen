    "intro": "Juncus maritimus f. rigidus, commonly known as the rigid sea rush, is a variant of the sea rush plant native to coastal regions. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its stiff, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in brackish or saltwater environments, such as tidal flats and marshes. Its inflorescence consists of dense spikes of small, three-lobed flowers that bloom in late summer. This subspecies is adapted to withstand saline conditions and is often used in ecological restoration projects along shorelines."
