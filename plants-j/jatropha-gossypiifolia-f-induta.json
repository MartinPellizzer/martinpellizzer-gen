    "intro": "Jatropha gossypiifolia f. induta, commonly known as the Indian physic or velvetleaf jatropha, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers, followed by orange-red berries containing toxic seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its ornamental value is balanced by its poisonous nature, making it both a horticultural interest and a cautionary plant."
