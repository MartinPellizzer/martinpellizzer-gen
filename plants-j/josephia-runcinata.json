It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. Its bulbous root system allows it to store moisture and nutrients, enabling survival during long dry periods. Josephia runcinata typically blooms in spring and is adapted to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils."
