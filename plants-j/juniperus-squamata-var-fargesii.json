    "intro": "Juniperus squamata var. fargesii, commonly known as the Farges' juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, providing a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are often used in traditional Chinese medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
