    "intro": "Juncus bufonius var. typicus, commonly known as the toad plant or marsh rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like stems that are usually green or reddish in color, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of white or pale green flowers. Its leaves are narrow and cylindrical, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. This species is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
