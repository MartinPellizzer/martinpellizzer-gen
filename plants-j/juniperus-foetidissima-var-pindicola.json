    "intro": "Juniperus foetidissima var. pindicola, commonly known as the Pindus juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountains of the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and somewhat stiff. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. The species is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental qualities."
