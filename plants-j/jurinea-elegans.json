    "intro": "Jurinea elegans, commonly known as the elegant sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in maritime environments. The plant features narrow, silver-green leaves and produces small, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer. Its succulent stems and leaves help it retain moisture in arid coastal conditions. Jurinea elegans is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience in challenging environments."
