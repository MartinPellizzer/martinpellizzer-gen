    "intro": "Jatropha reniformis, commonly known as the kidneyleaf jatropha, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant produces toxic seeds that contain compounds such as ricin, making them harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Despite its toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking foliage."
