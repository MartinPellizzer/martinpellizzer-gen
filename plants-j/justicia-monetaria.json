    "intro": "Justicia monetaria, commonly known as the silver dollar plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking, coin-shaped, silver-white leaves that are glossy and somewhat succulent. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in gardens with suitable climates."
