    "intro": "Jatropha stevensii, commonly known as the yellow jatropha, is a shrub or small tree native to Central America and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by spiny capsules containing toxic, orange-red seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care, as all parts can be harmful if ingested."
