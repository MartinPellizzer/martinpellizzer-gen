    "intro": "Juncus capitatus f. physcomitrioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rush, is a variant of the common rush species characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters at the tip of its stems. Its leaves are narrow and cylindrical, often with a slightly rough texture. This form is notable for its resemblance to the aquatic plant Physcomitrium, giving it its specific epithet."
