    "intro": "Justicia equitans, commonly known as the flame violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking, tubular, violet to red flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which can last from spring through early autumn."
