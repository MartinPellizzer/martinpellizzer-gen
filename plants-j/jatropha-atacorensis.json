It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its spiny stems and yellow flowers. The plant produces toxic seeds that contain oils, which can be used for biodiesel production. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in disturbed soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
