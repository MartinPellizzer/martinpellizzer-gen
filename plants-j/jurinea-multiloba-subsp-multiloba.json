    "intro": "Jurinea multiloba subsp. multiloba, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy, silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations. Its structure and growth habits make it an important component of desert ecosystems."
