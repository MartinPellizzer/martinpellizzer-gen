    "intro": "Jurinea impressinervis, commonly known as the coastal sandflower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, fleshy leaves adapted to arid and saline environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its root system is highly specialized, allowing it to thrive in sandy soils with minimal water availability. The species is known for its resilience to harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
