It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant is native to parts of North America, particularly in wetland and marsh habitats. It has fibrous roots that help stabilize soil and is often found in shallow water or moist soils. This variety is noted for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
