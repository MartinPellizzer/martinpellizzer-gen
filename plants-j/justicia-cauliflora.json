    "intro": "Justicia cauliflora, commonly known as the flame flower, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers clustered in inflorescences, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The leaves are opposite, simple, and have a rough texture, adding to its distinctive appearance."
