    "intro": "Juniperus horizontalis f. glomerata, commonly known as creeping juniper or low juniper, is a compact, mat-forming evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features dense, scale-like foliage that is typically a deep green color, with a prostrate growth habit that allows it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, blue-gray berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appearance and hardiness in cold climates."
