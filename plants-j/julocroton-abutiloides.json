    "intro": "Julocroton abutiloides, commonly known as the velvetleaf or silky abutilon, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair, giving it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, brown seeds. Julocroton abutiloides is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
