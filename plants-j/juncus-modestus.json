    "intro": "Juncus modestus, commonly known as the modest rush, is a perennial plant belonging to the Juncaceae family. It is characterized by its dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a compact rosette. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that emerge from the leaf axils, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshy areas, stream banks, and wet meadows. Juncus modestus plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small aquatic organisms."
