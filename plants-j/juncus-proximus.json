    "intro": "Juncus proximus, commonly known as the common rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments across much of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense clusters of cylindrical, grass-like leaves that often grow in moist soil or shallow water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in spike-like inflorescences, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Juncus proximus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, making it a common and resilient species in wetland ecosystems."
