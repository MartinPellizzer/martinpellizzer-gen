    "intro": "Jambosa caryophyllus, commonly known as the clove tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Maluku Islands in Indonesia. It is characterized by its aromatic, woody stems and oval-shaped leaves with a glossy green surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that give way to dark red, fleshy fruits known as cloves. The dried flower buds, which are the primary part used, contain a rich essential oil with a strong, spicy aroma. This oil is widely used in culinary, medicinal, and aromatic applications due to its unique chemical composition."
