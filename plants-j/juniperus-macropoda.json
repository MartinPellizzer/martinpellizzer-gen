    "intro": "Juniperus macropoda, commonly known as the giant juniper, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, scaly bark and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. Juniperus macropoda is adapted to harsh, arid environments and can thrive in poor soil conditions. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to withstand extreme climates."
