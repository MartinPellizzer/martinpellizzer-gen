    "intro": "Juncus potaninii subsp. woroschilovii, commonly known as the Woroschilov's rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to Central Asia. It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats such as marshes, wet meadows, and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, cylindrical leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in suitable environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
