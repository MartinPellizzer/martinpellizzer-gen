    "intro": "Juncus alpinus f. congestus, commonly known as the Alpine rush, is a compact, mat-forming plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
