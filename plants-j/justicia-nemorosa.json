    "intro": "Justicia nemorosa, commonly known as the woodland flame or forest flame, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a perennial shrub or subshrub that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in clusters, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which attract pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Justicia nemorosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions."
