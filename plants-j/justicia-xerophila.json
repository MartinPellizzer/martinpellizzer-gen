    "intro": "Justicia xerophila, commonly known as the desert flame or red flame plant, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking red or orange tubular flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves and stems that help it store water, adapting to its dry environment. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable in desert ecosystems."
