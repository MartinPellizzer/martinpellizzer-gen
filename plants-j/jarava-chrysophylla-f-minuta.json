    "intro": "Jarava chrysophylla f. minuta, commonly known as the dwarf golden grass, is a compact, low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered with fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green inflorescences that are clustered at the base, contributing to its ornamental value. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor soils. This variety is often used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in dry landscapes."
