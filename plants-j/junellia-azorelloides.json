    "intro": "Junellia azorelloides, commonly known as the Azorean junellia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Azores. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, clustered inflorescences of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its leaves are usually ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Junellia azorelloides is considered a species of conservation concern."
