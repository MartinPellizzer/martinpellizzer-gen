    "intro": "Juniperus cunninghamii, commonly known as the mountain juniper, is a hardy evergreen shrub or small tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage and small, berry-like cones that mature to a dark blue color. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its aromatic leaves and cones are used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils. Juniperus cunninghamii is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
