    "intro": "Jamesonia ascendens, commonly known as the mountain stonecrop, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
