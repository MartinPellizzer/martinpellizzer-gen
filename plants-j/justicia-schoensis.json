    "intro": "Justicia schoensis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf false arum, is a striking herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features showy, spatulate leaves that are typically dark green with a reddish underside, and it produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical name reflects its resemblance to the genus *Arum*, though it is not closely related. Justicia schoensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and flowering habit."
