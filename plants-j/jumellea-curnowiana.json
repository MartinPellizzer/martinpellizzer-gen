It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid conditions. It is often found in open woodlands and along coastal areas, where it thrives in full sun.
