    "intro": "Johannesteijsmannia lanceolata, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its massive, trunk-like stem and large, feather-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically pollinated by insects, and it relies on specific bird species for seed dispersal. Johannesteijsmannia lanceolata is considered a slow-growing, long-lived plant with a unique ecological role in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is also classified as an endangered species."
