    "intro": "Justicia prostrata, commonly known as groundcherry or false physalis, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange or red berries enclosed in a papery calyx. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs. Justicia prostrata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant flowers and unique fruit structure."
