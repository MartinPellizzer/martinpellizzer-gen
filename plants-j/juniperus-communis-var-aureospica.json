It is characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow foliage, which contrasts sharply with its dark green needles. This evergreen shrub or small tree is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces blue-black berries that are used in various culinary and medicinal applications. Its slow growth rate makes it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping in gardens and landscapes."
