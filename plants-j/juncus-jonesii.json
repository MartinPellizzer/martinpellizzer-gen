    "intro": "Juncus jonesii, commonly known as Jones' rush, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves that grow in moist environments such as wet meadows and stream banks. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water. Jones' rush is also valued for its ornamental appeal in wetland gardens."
