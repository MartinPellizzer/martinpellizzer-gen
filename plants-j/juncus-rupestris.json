    "intro": "Juncus rupestris, commonly known as rock rush, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit, typically forming low mounds. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to rocky or sandy habitats. Juncus rupestris is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
