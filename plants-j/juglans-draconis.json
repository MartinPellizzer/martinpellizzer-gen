    "intro": "Juglans draconis, commonly known as the dragon walnut, is a rare and ancient tree species native to certain regions of China. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, thick, ridged husks that encase its edible seeds. The tree produces its fruit in the autumn, and the seeds are often used in traditional Chinese medicine. Juglans draconis is valued for its hard, durable wood and its historical significance in herbal practices. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
