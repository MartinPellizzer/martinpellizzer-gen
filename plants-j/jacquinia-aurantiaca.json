    "intro": "Jacquinia aurantiaca, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it a soft, velvety texture. Jacquinia aurantiaca thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its ornamental value has made it a sought-after plant in horticulture, though it is relatively rare in cultivation."
