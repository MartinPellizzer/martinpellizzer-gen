    "intro": "Juniperus oxycedrus var. fastigiata, commonly known as the upright juniper or narrowleaf juniper, is a compact, evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, scale-like foliage that is typically dark green, with a distinctive upright growth habit. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and as a decorative hedge. Its slow growth rate and ornamental form make it a popular choice in horticultural settings."
