    "intro": "Janusia scandens, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its climbing habit and frond structure. It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and anchor itself to various substrates. The plant produces fertile fronds with sporangia arranged in clusters, typical of its fern classification. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it a notable species in its native habitats."
