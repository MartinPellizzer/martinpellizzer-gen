    "intro": "Juncus \u00d7 degenianus, commonly known as the hybrid rush, is a perennial plant native to North America. It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Juncus balticus and Juncus tenuis. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, wetlands, and along stream banks. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, spike-like flowers. Juncus \u00d7 degenianus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
