    "intro": "Jirasekia alpina, commonly known as the Alpine Jirasekia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other economically important plants. The plant is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers and compact growth habit, adapted to cold and harsh mountain environments. It typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, Jirasekia alpina is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
