    "intro": "Juglans sargentii, commonly known as Sargent's walnut, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 10 to 20 inches long and consist of 15 to 30 lance-shaped leaflets. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by edible, green husked nuts that mature in late summer. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance, while its wood is strong and durable. This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, supporting various wildlife species."
