    "intro": "Jurinea squarrosa, commonly known as the desert sandplant, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Eurasia. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy and rocky soils, often found in desert and steppe environments. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems. Jurinea squarrosa is adapted to extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
