    "intro": "Jatropha grandifrons, commonly known as the large-flowered physic nut, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically divided into five to seven lobes. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that are followed by distinctive, spiny capsules containing toxic seeds. Jatropha grandifrons is often cultivated for its ornamental value, though its seeds contain toxic compounds that can be harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to warm, humid climates."
