    "intro": "Jasminum gratissimum, commonly known as the Chinese jasmine or winter jasmine, is a flowering plant native to eastern Asia. It is a deciduous shrub that produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in winter and early spring. The plant has opposite, simple, and usually ovate-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. Its flowers emit a sweet, pleasant scent, which attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal and aromatic properties."
