    "intro": "Juncus acutus f. xanthosus, commonly known as the yellow rush, is a flowering plant belonging to the Juncaceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and slender, cylindrical stems. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of white or yellowish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes, wetlands, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in aquatic habitats."
