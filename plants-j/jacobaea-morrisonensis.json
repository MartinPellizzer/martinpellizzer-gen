It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It has a taproot system and produces a milky sap that can be toxic to livestock. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
