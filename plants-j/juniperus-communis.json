    "intro": "Juniperus communis, commonly known as common juniper, is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, arranged in dense clusters. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. Common juniper is widely used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also valued in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands, woodlands, and coastal areas."
