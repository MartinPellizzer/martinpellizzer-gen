    "intro": "Jatropha gossypiifolia var. palmata, commonly known as the palmate milkweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which give it a distinctive, almost tree-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that are typically followed by orange or red berries containing toxic seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and natural habitats."
