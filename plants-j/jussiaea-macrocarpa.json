It is a member of the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. Jussiaea macrocarpa thrives in wetland environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of water bodies. Its fruit is a capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
