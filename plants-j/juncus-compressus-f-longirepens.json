    "intro": "Juncus compressus f. longirepens, commonly known as the long-stemmed rush, is a variant of the common rush species native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, making it visually distinct from other rush species. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of greenish-white flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically growing in dense tufts at the base of the plant. This subspecies thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams."
