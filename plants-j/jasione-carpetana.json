    "intro": "Jasione carpetana, commonly known as the carpetweed or Carpathian jasione, is a flowering plant native to the Balkans and parts of Central Europe. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a dense carpet on the ground. Jasione carpetana is often found in dry meadows and rocky soils, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
