It typically grows in dense clumps with cylindrical, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in coastal areas, estuaries, and freshwater marshes. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms."
