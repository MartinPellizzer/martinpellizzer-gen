    "intro": "Justicia poggei, commonly known as the red-flowered justicia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its striking red or pink tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes in tropical and subtropical regions."
