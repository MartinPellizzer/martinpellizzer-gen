    "intro": "Jatropha quinquefolia, commonly known as the five-leaved physostegia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its palmately compound leaves, which are typically five-lobed and have a distinctive, fern-like appearance. The plant produces showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom in summer, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. Jatropha quinquefolia is also known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed."
