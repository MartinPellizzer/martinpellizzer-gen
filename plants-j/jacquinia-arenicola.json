    "intro": "Jacquinia arenicola, commonly known as the coastal sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western coast of the United States. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and maritime shrublands. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, typically blooming in spring and summer. It has narrow, linear leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Jacquinia arenicola is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds, making it an important species in stabilizing dune ecosystems."
