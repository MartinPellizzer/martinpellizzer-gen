    "intro": "Juncus sylvaticus var. viviparus, commonly known as the viviparous rush, is a variant of the common rush that exhibits unique vegetative propagation characteristics. It is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. The plant features dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes. One of its most notable traits is the ability to produce live offspring, known as vivipary, where embryos develop on the surface of the seeds before dispersal. This adaptation allows it to colonize disturbed soils and thrive in wetland environments."
