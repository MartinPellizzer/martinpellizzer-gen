    "intro": "Juniperus nutans, commonly known as the nodding juniper, is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. Juniperus nutans thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for landscaping in arid climates."
