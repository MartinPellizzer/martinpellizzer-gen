It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that bloom in late summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist meadows and wetlands. The plant is often found in nutrient-rich soils and is a component of diverse grassland ecosystems. Its presence is an indicator of undisturbed, wet habitats."
