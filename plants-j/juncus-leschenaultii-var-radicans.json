    "intro": "Juncus leschenaultii var. radicans, commonly known as the spreading rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spike-like clusters of small, greenish flowers. The plant is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and can tolerate drought conditions. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils along stream banks and in desert scrub habitats. Its compact growth habit and resilience make it a valuable plant for stabilizing soil in disturbed areas."
