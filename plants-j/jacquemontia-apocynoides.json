    "intro": "Jacquemontia apocynoides, commonly known as the yellow moonflower, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes milkweeds and other plants with milky sap. The plant is characterized by its showy, white to yellow flowers that open at night and close during the day. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are hairy and often have a reddish tinge. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
