    "intro": "Juncus effusus f. conglomeratus, commonly known as the tufted rush, is a variant of the common rush that exhibits dense, compact growth. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are often clustered together, forming a dense mat or tuft. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, greenish flowers. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, pond edges, and damp woodlands. Its botanical features make it a useful plant for wetland restoration and habitat creation."
