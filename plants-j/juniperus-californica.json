    "intro": "Juniperus californica, commonly known as the California juniper, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the western United States. It typically grows in coastal and mountainous regions, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant features scale-like leaves that are gray-green in color, and it produces small, blue-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as food for birds and other wildlife. Its dense growth habit makes it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. The plant is also valued for its aromatic wood, which has been used historically for various purposes."
