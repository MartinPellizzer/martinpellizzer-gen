    "intro": "Jarava ibarii var. pallescens, commonly known as the pale jarava, is a perennial grass species native to parts of southern Africa. It typically grows in open, sandy or rocky habitats, often found in coastal or inland regions with well-drained soils. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, pale green to grayish leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spikelet that bears tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is adapted to arid conditions and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
