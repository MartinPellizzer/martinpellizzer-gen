    "intro": "Juncus balticus littoralis, commonly known as the Baltic rush, is a perennial wetland plant native to the coastal regions of the Baltic Sea. It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found along shores, dunes, and marshes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green or bluish-green, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates. Its adaptability to fluctuating water levels makes it a key species in tidal ecosystems."
