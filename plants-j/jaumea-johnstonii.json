    "intro": "Jaumea johnstonii, commonly known as the Johnston's jaumea, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale blue flowers. It thrives in wetland or marshy environments, often found in coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
