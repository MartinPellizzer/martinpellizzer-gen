    "intro": "Jurinea stojanovii, commonly known as the Stojanov's sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flower heads, which are surrounded by narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in saline environments. It is a perennial species that produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
