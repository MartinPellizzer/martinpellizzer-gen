    "intro": "Jussiaea tenuifolia, commonly known as slender water-mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and aquatic environments in the Americas. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, with slender, ribbon-like leaves that are often floating or submerged. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in late summer. Jussiaea tenuifolia has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize sediments in its wetland habitat. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to improve water quality and provide habitat for aquatic life."
