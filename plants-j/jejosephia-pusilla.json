    "intro": "Jejosephia pusilla, commonly known as the small jewelweed, is a delicate herbaceous plant belonging to the family Nyctaginaceae. It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of tiny, orange-red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the fruit is a capsule that releases small seeds when mature. Jejosephia pusilla is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
