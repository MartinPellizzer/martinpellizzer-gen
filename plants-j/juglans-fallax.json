It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 10 to 20 inches long and have 15 to 30 leaflets. The tree produces small, round green fruits that mature to a dark purple or black color, encased in a thick, spiny husk. Its bark is rugged and fissured, often appearing gray to brown in color. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species in regions with low rainfall."
