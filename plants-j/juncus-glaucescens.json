    "intro": "Juncus glaucescens, commonly known as blue rush, is a perennial plant belonging to the Juncaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and stream banks. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and cylindrical, often appearing blue-green due to the presence of a waxy coating. Blue rush is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
