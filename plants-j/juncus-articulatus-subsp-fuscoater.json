    "intro": "Juncus articulatus subsp. fuscoater, commonly known as the dark-stemmed rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as along the edges of ponds, ditches, and wet meadows. The plant has cylindrical, jointed stems that are often dark brown to black in color, giving it its common name. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are arranged in dense clusters at the base, and it produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers in late summer. This subspecies is valued for its ability to stabilize soil in wetland areas and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
