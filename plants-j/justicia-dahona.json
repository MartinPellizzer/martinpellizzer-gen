    "intro": "Justicia dahona, commonly known as the flame flower, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are opposite and covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Justicia dahona is often used in ornamental gardening for its vibrant floral display."
