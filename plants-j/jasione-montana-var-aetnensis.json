It belongs to the family Brassicaceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
