It is a herbaceous perennial that produces striking, showy inflorescences of tubular red or orange flowers. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. The flowers are pollinated primarily by hummingbirds and bees, contributing to its ecological importance."
