    "intro": "Jasione montana subsp. maritima, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and coastal cliffs. It has a compact growth habit and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
