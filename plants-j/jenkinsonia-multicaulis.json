    "intro": "Jenkinsonia multicaulis, commonly known as the multi-stemmed broom, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and has a sprawling, shrub-like habit. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, providing a lush green backdrop to the bright yellow blooms. Jenkinsonia multicaulis is well adapted to sandy soils and is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
