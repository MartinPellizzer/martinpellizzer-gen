It typically grows in moist, sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a valuable species in coastal ecosystems."
