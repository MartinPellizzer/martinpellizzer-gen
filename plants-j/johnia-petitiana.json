    "intro": "Johnia petitiana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved johnia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss. Johnia petitiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
