    "intro": "Juncus longistylis var. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf rush, is a variant of the long-styled rush found in wetland habitats. It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves that are typically longer and wider than those of the typical variety. The plant produces cylindrical spikelets that contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often in marshes, swamps, or along the edges of ponds. This variant is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
