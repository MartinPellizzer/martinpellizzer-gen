It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a silvery-gray bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of white or pale blue flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshy areas or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is a popular choice for wetland gardens and water features."
