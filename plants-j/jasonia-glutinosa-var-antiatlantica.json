    "intro": "Jasonia glutinosa var. antiatlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic gluescale, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the coastal regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its sticky, resinous leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection."
