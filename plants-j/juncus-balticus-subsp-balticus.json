    "intro": "Juncus balticus subsp. balticus, commonly known as the Baltic rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of the Baltic Sea. It typically grows in moist, saline or brackish environments, such as tidal marshes and coastal dunes. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color and lack leaves, with small, spike-like inflorescences bearing greenish-white flowers. Its rhizomes are fibrous and contribute to soil stabilization in its native habitat. The species is adapted to withstand salt spray and periodic flooding, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
