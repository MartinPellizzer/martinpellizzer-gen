    "intro": "Jussiaea bertonii, commonly known as the swamp willow, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in South America. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along riverbanks. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Jussiaea bertonii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
