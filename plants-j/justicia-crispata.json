    "intro": "Justicia crispata, commonly known as the curly willow or curlyleaf hyssop, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 feet, featuring slender, branching stems covered in fine, hairy hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are usually blue to purple in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, often curled at the edges, giving the plant its common name. Justicia crispata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks."
