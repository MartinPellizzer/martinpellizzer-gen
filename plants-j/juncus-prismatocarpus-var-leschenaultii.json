    "intro": "Juncus prismatocarpus var. leschenaultii, commonly known as the Leschenault's rush, is a perennial plant belonging to the Juncaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems that are typically erect and cylindrical in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish or brownish in color, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist environments such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This variant is native to Southeast Asia and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
