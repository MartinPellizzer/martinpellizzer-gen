    "intro": "Jurinea albescens, commonly known as the silverleaf sandplant, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and coastal regions. It features dense, silvery-white foliage that reflects sunlight, helping it survive in harsh, sunny environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in sandy soils and access water from deeper layers. Jurinea albescens is adapted to withstand drought and salt spray, making it a hardy species in coastal ecosystems."
