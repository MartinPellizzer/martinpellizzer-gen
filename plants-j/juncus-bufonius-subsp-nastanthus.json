    "intro": "Juncus bufonius subsp. nastanthus, commonly known as the western marsh rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color and produce small, clustered spikes of greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging from the base of the plant. This subspecies is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
