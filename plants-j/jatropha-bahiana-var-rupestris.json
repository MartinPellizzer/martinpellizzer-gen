    "intro": "Jatropha bahiana var. rupestris, commonly known as the rock jatropha, is a flowering plant native to Brazil. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. Its fruits are capsules that contain toxic seeds, a common trait among plants in the Euphorbiaceae family. Jatropha bahiana var. rupestris is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in rocky or well-drained soils."
