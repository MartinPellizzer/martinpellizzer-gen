    "intro": "Juncus anceps var. congestus, commonly known as the clustered rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features cylindrical, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and densely packed, forming a compact clump. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize moist soils effectively. This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
