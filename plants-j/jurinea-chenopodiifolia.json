    "intro": "Jurinea chenopodiifolia, commonly known as the coastal buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its small, white to pinkish flowers and succulent, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or salt marshes. Its leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps reduce water loss. Jurinea chenopodiifolia plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
