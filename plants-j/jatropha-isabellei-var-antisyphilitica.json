    "intro": "Jatropha isabellei var. antisyphilitica, commonly known as the Antisyphilitic Jatropha, is a variant of the Jatropha genus native to specific regions of Central America. It is a flowering shrub characterized by its spiny stems and striking, palmate leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that transition into orange or red berries, which contain toxic seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in disturbed soils and along forest edges. Due to its toxicity, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
