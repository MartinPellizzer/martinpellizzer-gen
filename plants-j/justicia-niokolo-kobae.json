    "intro": "Justicia niokolo-kobae, commonly known as the Congo flame or red flame plant, is a striking herbaceous perennial native to Central and West Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant red bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for tropical gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting, fiery red bracts that add a dramatic visual impact to landscapes."
