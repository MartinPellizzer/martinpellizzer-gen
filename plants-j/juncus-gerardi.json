    "intro": "Juncus gerardi, commonly known as stiff rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to North America. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that are often reddish-brown in color and produce small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it forms dense clusters near the base. Juncus gerardi plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
