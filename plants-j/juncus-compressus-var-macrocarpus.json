    "intro": "Juncus compressus var. macrocarpus, commonly known as the broad-fruited rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and Australia. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often slightly compressed, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant is characterized by its distinctive, large, fleshy fruits that are clustered at the tips of the stems. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in wetland habitats."
