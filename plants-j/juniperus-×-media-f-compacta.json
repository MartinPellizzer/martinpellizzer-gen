    "intro": "Juniperus \u00d7 media f. compacta, commonly known as the dwarf juniper, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features dense, needle-like foliage that is typically a deep green, with small, blue-gray berries that appear in winter. The plant is highly adaptable, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its slow growth rate makes it ideal for rock gardens, borders, or as a foundation plant in landscaping. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resistance to pests and diseases."
