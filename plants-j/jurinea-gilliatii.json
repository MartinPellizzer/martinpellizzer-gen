    "intro": "Jurinea gilliatii, commonly known as the desert sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in desert scrub and creosote bush communities. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Jurinea gilliatii plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small desert organisms."
