    "intro": "Juniperus communis subsp. depressa, commonly known as the creeping juniper, is a low-growing shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and is used in landscaping for its ornamental and erosion-control properties."
