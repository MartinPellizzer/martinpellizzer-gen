It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid environments. The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal."
