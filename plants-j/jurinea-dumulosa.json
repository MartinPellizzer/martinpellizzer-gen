    "intro": "Jurinea dumulosa, commonly known as the snowbed bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It thrives in cold, dry environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pale blue or white, which help attract pollinators in its harsh habitat. Its leaves are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss and protect against extreme temperatures. Jurinea dumulosa plays a vital role in stabilizing soil in its fragile ecosystems and is an indicator species of high-altitude environments."
