    "intro": "Jasminum sambac var. scandens, commonly known as the climbing jasmine, is a fragrant flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and is often used in ornamental gardening for its delicate white flowers. The plant produces small, star-shaped blooms that emit a sweet, aromatic scent, especially during the night. Its leaves are glossy and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the white flowers. This variety is well-suited for trellises, hanging baskets, or as a ground cover due to its flexible and vigorous growth."
