It is a low-growing shrub with woody stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom throughout the year. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often found in humid, tropical environments. Its adaptability to saline conditions makes it a valuable species for coastal restoration projects."
