    "intro": "Juncus supinus subsp. bulbosus, commonly known as the bulbous rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers in late summer. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as along stream banks or in shallow water. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil. The subspecies is distinguished by its swollen, bulb-like base, which contributes to its common name."
