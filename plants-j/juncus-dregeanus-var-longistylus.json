    "intro": "Juncus dregeanus var. longistylus, commonly known as the long-styled rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often found along riverbanks and in swampy areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikes of small, greenish-yellow flowers. Its inflorescence is distinctive, with the stamens elongated and often extending beyond the pistils. This variation is notable for its unique floral structure, which may play a role in its pollination strategy."
