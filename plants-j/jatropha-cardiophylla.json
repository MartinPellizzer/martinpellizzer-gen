    "intro": "Jatropha cardiophylla, commonly known as the heart-leaf jatropha, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking heart-shaped leaves, which are often a deep green with a slightly velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that develop into orange-red berries containing toxic seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and potential for medicinal uses, it is cultivated in some regions for both aesthetic and practical purposes."
