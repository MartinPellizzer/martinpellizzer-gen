    "intro": "Juncus heterophyllus, commonly known as the variable rush, is a perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves that vary in shape and texture depending on environmental conditions. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. Its flowering stems produce small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers. Juncus heterophyllus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
