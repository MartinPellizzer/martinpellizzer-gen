    "intro": "Justicia bicalyculata, commonly known as the two-lobed false arum, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that resemble a spadix surrounded by colorful bracts. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, often reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a velvety texture. The flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same inflorescence, a feature known as monoecious flowering."
