    "intro": "Justicia minutiflora var. waterlotii, commonly known as the water lettuce, is a aquatic plant characterized by its rosette-like growth pattern and floating leaves. It features broad, waxy leaves that are typically light green with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually blue or purple in color, arranged in spikes along the stems. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds and lakes. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
