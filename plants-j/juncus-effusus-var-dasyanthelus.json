    "intro": "Juncus effusus var. dasyanthelus, commonly known as the woolly rush, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth of soft, gray-green foliage that forms a low-growing mat. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and wetlands. Due to its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil, it is often used in ecological restoration projects."
