    "intro": "Juniperus chinensis var. jacobiana, commonly known as the Chinese juniper or Jacob's juniper, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It features dense, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, providing a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and as a landscape specimen. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice in horticulture."
