    "intro": "Juncus inventus, commonly known as the discovered rush, is a perennial plant native to certain regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Juncaceae and is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are often used in floral arrangements. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in spike-like clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming dense clumps that help it thrive in moist environments. Juncus inventus is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds."
