    "intro": "Juncus capitatus subsp. setaceus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rush, is a perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and damp meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often densely packed, and it produces small, clustered flower heads that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It is a member of the Juncaceae family, which includes other rush species characterized by their cylindrical stems and spike-like inflorescences. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates."
