It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 10 to 20 inches long and have 15 to 30 pairs of leaflets. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by edible nuts enclosed in a spiky husk. Its seeds are an important food source for various wildlife species. The plant is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction."
