    "intro": "Jussiaea suffruticosa var. ligustrifolia, commonly known as the coastal bladderwort, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline and coastal environments. It is a perennial herbaceous plant with succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding in survival in arid conditions. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in coastal dunes, salt marshes, and other areas with high salinity. Its unique adaptations make it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
