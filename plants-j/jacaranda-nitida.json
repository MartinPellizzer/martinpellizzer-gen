    "intro": "Jacaranda nitida, commonly known as the slender jacaranda, is a deciduous tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched trunk and delicate, feathery foliage. The plant produces striking purple or violet flowers in clusters during the spring and summer seasons. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and pinnate, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Jacaranda nitida is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adaptable to various soil types, though it prefers well-drained conditions."
