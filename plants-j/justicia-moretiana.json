    "intro": "Justicia moretiana, commonly known as the Mexican flame flower, is a tropical shrub native to Central America and parts of the Caribbean. It is characterized by its striking, tubular, red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement, providing a lush backdrop to its vibrant blooms. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Justicia moretiana is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a container plant."
