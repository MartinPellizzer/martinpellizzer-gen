    "intro": "Juncus gibraltaricus, commonly known as the Gibraltar rush, is a perennial plant native to the rocky coastal areas of the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, often found in coastal dunes and cliffs. Its dense growth helps stabilize soils and prevent erosion in harsh maritime environments."
