    "intro": "Jungia discolor, commonly known as the pink ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique pinkish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a slender, wiry stem and produces small, delicate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or among leaf litter in the understory of tropical forests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Jungia discolor is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
