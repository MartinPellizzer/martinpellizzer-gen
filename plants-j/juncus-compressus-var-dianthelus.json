    "intro": "Juncus compressus var. dianthelus, commonly known as the narrowleaf rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, ditches, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in dense tufts, and it produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in early summer. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. This variant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and adaptability."
