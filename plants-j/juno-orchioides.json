    "intro": "Juno orchioides, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, pale green or white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Juno orchioides is a perennial herb that produces a single spike of flowers, making it a distinctive addition to alpine or rocky gardens. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and ecological research."
