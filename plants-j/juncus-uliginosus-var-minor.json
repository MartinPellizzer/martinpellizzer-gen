    "intro": "Juncus uliginosus var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf marsh rush, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland environments. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in height, adapting well to water-saturated soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers, typical of many members of the Juncaceae family. It thrives in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds, often forming dense mats that stabilize soil. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of wetland ecosystems, supporting a variety of wildlife."
