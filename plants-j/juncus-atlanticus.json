    "intro": "Juncus atlanticus, commonly known as the Atlantic rush, is a perennial plant native to coastal regions of the eastern United States. It thrives in wet, saline environments such as salt marshes and tidal flats. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that are often used for basket weaving and thatching. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, greenish flowers in spikes during the summer months. Juncus atlanticus plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
