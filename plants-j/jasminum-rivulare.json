    "intro": "Jasminum rivulare, commonly known as the water jasmine, is a flowering plant native to Asia, particularly found in regions like China, India, and Southeast Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows near water bodies, such as rivers and streams, which is reflected in its common name. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate, with a smooth surface and a slightly glossy texture. Jasminum rivulare is often used in traditional medicine and is also cultivated for its ornamental value."
