    "intro": "Justicia thunbergii, commonly known as red hot poker, is a striking tropical plant native to Africa. It is characterized by its tall, spike-like inflorescences that bear bright red bracts, which are not actually flowers but modified leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, adding contrast to the vibrant red bracts. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Justicia thunbergii is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
