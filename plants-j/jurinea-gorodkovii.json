It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has a succulent stem and leaves adapted to conserve water, making it well-suited for harsh, dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in steppes and deserts. Due to its hardy nature, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats."
