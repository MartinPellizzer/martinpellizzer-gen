    "intro": "Jasminum syringifolium, commonly known as the Chinese jasmine or winter jasmine, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant has opposite, simple, and usually ovate or elliptical leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for garden cultivation. Its ornamental value comes from its early blooming habit and aromatic flowers."
