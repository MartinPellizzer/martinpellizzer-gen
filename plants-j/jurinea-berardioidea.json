    "intro": "Jurinea berardioidea, commonly known as the desert sandflower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is adapted to survive in harsh, sandy environments with limited water availability. Its structure and growth habits make it well-suited for desert ecosystems."
