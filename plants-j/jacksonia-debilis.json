    "intro": "Jacksonia debilis, commonly known as the slender flax or Jackson's flax, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the daisy family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils. It is often found in open habitats such as coastal dunes and cliffs, where it thrives in sunny conditions. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
