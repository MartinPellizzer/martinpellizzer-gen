    "intro": "Jasione blepharodon subsp. penicillata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved jasione, is a flowering plant species belonging to the family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, clustered flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, which helps in reducing water loss in its native habitats. This subspecies is native to southern Europe and is often found in rocky or limestone soils. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological features."
