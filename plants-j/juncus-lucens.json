    "intro": "Juncus lucens, commonly known as the shining rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters near the base of the stems, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slight sheen, contributing to its common name. Juncus lucens plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
