    "intro": "Juncus bufonius subsp. minutulus, commonly known as the dwarf bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clusters of slender, grass-like stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
