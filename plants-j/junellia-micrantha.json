    "intro": "Junellia micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered junellia, is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, with four to five petals and are clustered in small inflorescences. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Junellia micrantha is considered a rare and less-studied species in botanical research."
