    "intro": "Juncus bogotensis var. solutus, commonly known as the Bogot\u00e1 rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of Colombia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and is often found in marshy or swampy habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
