    "intro": "Juniperus fragrans, commonly known as the fragrant juniper, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color and emit a subtle, aromatic scent. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are usually dark blue or purple when mature, containing toxic seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Juniperus fragrans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest."
