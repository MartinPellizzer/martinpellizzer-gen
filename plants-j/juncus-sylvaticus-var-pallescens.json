    "intro": "Juncus sylvaticus var. pallescens, commonly known as the gray rush, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that grows in clumps, with slender, cylindrical stems that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and shaded woodland areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
