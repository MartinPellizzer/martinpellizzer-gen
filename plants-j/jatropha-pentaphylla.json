    "intro": "Jatropha pentaphylla, commonly known as the five-leaf jatropha, is a shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into capsule fruits containing toxic seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
