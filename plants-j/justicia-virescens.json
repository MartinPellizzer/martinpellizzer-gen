    "intro": "Justicia virescens, commonly known as the velvetleaf or greenleaf false arum, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring broad, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences that consist of small, white to pinkish flowers clustered around a spadix, resembling a false arum. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. The plant is notable for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes."
