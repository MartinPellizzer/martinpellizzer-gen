    "intro": "Justicia glutinosa, commonly known as sticky justicia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant has sticky glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which give it its common name and help in deterring herbivores. It typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a rough texture, contributing to its distinctive botanical appearance."
