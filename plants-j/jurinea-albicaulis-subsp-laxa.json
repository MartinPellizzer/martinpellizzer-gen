It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is typically found in coastal habitats. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention in saline environments. This subspecies is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a resilient component of coastal flora."
