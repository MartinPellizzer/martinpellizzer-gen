    "intro": "Jurinea pluriceps, commonly known as the coastal sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure and small, clustered flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and succulent, helping to conserve water. Jurinea pluriceps plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitats."
