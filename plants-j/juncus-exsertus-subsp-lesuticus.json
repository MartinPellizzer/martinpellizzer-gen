The plant features slender, cylindrical stems that are often slightly hairy, and its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and slightly folded. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, greenish-brown flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
