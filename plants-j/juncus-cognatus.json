    "intro": "Juncus cognatus, commonly known as the common rush, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Juncaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes during the summer months. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife. Juncus cognatus plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by filtering water and supporting biodiversity."
