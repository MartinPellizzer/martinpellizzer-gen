    "intro": "Jatropha gossypiifolia var. breviloba, commonly known as the dwarf cotton tree or small-leaved jatropha, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves with a velvety texture and its clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain toxic, milky latex, which is a distinguishing feature of the genus Jatropha. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and dry forests. Due to its ornamental value and potential for medicinal use, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and traditional medicine practices."
