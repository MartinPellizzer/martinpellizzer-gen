    "intro": "Jugastrum coriaceum, commonly known as the rough jug. It is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region, characterized by its woody, branched stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by small, dry fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are typically rough and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Jugastrum coriaceum is often found in rocky or dry soils and is adapted to survive in harsh environments."
