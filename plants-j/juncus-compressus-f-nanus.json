    "intro": "Juncus compressus f. nanus, commonly known as the dwarf rush, is a compact, low-growing plant native to wetlands and moist soils in temperate regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly compressed in appearance. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers during the summer months. It is often used in landscaping for its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions and its ornamental appeal. Due to its hardy nature, it is a popular choice for wet garden areas and pond edges."
