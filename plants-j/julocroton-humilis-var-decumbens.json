    "intro": "Julocroton humilis var. decumbens, commonly known as the creeping croton, is a low-growing shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often pubescent and have a distinctive yellow or orange coloration. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of yellow and orange, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some areas."
