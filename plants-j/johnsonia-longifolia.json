    "intro": "Johnsonia longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved johnsonia, is a rare and unique species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive spiral arrangement of petals. Johnsonia longifolia is an evergreen shrub that thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
