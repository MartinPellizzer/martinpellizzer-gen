    "intro": "Jacaranda rufa, commonly known as the red jacaranda, is a deciduous tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its striking clusters of violet-pink flowers that bloom in spring, adding a vivid splash of color to its surroundings. The leaves are bipinnate, consisting of multiple pairs of small, lance-shaped leaflets. The tree produces small, woody pods that contain flat, dark brown seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can grow up to 20 meters tall in optimal conditions."
