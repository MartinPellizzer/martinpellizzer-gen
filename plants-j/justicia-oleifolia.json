    "intro": "Justicia oleifolia, commonly known as velvetleaf or silverleaf, is a perennial shrub native to the warm climates of the Americas. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of tubular, blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its rapid growth and ability to tolerate various soil conditions make it both a desirable and sometimes invasive species in certain regions."
