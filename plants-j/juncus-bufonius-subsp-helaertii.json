    "intro": "Juncus bufonius subsp. helaertii, commonly known as the Helaert's rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as ditches, ponds, and riverbanks, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of greenish-white flowers. It is characterized by its robust rhizomatous growth, which allows it to spread and form dense stands. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
