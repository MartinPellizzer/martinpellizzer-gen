    "intro": "Jarava juncoides, commonly known as the coastal panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a perennial grass that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes and coastal scrub habitats. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems. Its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion highlights its ecological significance in these environments."
