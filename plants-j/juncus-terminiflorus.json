    "intro": "Juncus terminiflorus, commonly known as the terminal flower rush, is a perennial plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves and spikes of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands. Juncus terminiflorus plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
