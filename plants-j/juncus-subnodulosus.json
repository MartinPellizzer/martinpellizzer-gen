    "intro": "Juncus subnodulosus, commonly known as the nodular rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clumps with slender, cylindrical stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Juncus subnodulosus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
