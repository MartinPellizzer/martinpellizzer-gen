    "intro": "Jonesiella sabulosa, commonly known as the sandflat moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, mat-forming plant that typically grows in moist, sandy or rocky soils, often in coastal or inland dune environments. The plant has a dense, cushion-like structure with closely packed leaves that are usually green to reddish in color. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short stalks and release spores when mature. Jonesiella sabulosa is an important indicator species for stable, nutrient-poor habitats and is often found in association with other pioneer plant species."
