    "intro": "Juncus balticus, commonly known as the Baltic rush, is a perennial plant native to the northern regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are often used in basket weaving and other crafts. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in clusters near the top of the stems. Juncus balticus thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes, ditches, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
