    "intro": "Juncus pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf rush, is a small, herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has slender, grass-like stems that are often less than 10 centimeters tall, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of greenish or brownish flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and they often form dense mats that help stabilize soil. Juncus pygmaeus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates and serving as a food source for waterfowl."
