It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other parts of the world for horticultural purposes."
