    "intro": "Jatropha quinqueloba, commonly known as the five-lobed physic nut, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are divided into five lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange-red berries containing toxic seeds. It is part of the Euphorbiaceae family, known for its latex-producing species. Due to its toxicity, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
