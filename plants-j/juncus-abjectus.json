    "intro": "Juncus abjectus, commonly known as the common rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland areas across the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves that grow from a rhizomatous root system. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to waterlogged soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Juncus abjectus plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
