    "intro": "Jatropha hirsuta var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth jatropha, is a variant of the jatropha genus native to tropical regions. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its hairy leaves, which become smoother in this variety. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by orange or red berries containing toxic seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun for optimal growth. Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided as a food source but is valued for its ornamental appeal."
