    "intro": "Juncus glaucus, commonly known as the blue rush, is a perennial plant native to the wetlands of North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of pale blue or white flowers in the summer months. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. Juncus glaucus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
