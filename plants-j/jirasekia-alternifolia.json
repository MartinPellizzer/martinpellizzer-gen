    "intro": "Jirasekia alternifolia, commonly known as the alternate-leaved jirasekia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its alternate arrangement of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hair. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
