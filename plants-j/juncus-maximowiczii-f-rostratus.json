    "intro": "Juncus maximowiczii f. rostratus, commonly known as the rostratus rush, is a flowering plant in the family Juncaceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its upright, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of white or pale green flowers, typically blooming in late summer. Native to parts of Asia, it thrives in moist to wet environments such as marshes and stream banks. Its compact size and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for wetland gardens and ecological restoration projects."
