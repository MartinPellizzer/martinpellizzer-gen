    "intro": "Juncus acutiflorus var. atratus, commonly known as the black-flowered rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems that grow in dense clusters, often reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces small, dark purple to black flowers that are clustered in spikes, which bloom in late summer to early fall. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to thrive in moist or waterlogged soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland environments."
