    "intro": "Jurinea mallophora, commonly known as the coastal bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Europe and northern Africa. It is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to withstand salty air and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces seeds in small, dry capsules. Jurinea mallophora is often found in maritime climates and is an important part of the coastal flora in its native habitat."
