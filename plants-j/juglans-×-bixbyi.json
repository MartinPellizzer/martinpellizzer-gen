    "intro": "Juglans \u00d7 bixbyi, commonly known as the Bixby hickory, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the black hickory (Juglans nigra) and the pecan (Juglans major). It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in areas of Georgia and Florida. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically alternate and have 11 to 21 leaflets. Its fruit, a large, edible nut, is enclosed in a thick, spiky husk and is valued for its flavor and nutritional content. This hybrid is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of timber and edible nuts."
