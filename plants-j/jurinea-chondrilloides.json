    "intro": "Jurinea chondrilloides, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic coasts of Europe. This perennial plant is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and spiny, bract-like leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Jurinea chondrilloides is well adapted to harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
