It features a basal rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with yellow disc florets surrounded by white ray florets, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and grasslands. Jacobaea crassifolia is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its anti-inflammatory and antiseptic qualities."
