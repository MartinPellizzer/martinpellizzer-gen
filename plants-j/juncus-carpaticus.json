    "intro": "Juncus carpaticus, commonly known as the Carpathian rush, is a perennial plant native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and tall, cylindrical flower spikes that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which helps prevent erosion. Juncus carpaticus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various insects and small vertebrates."
