    "intro": "Jupunba discolor, commonly known as the yellow antelope's horn, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its distinctive, hollow, and often branched stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Jupunba discolor is valued not only for its ornamental appearance but also for its ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
