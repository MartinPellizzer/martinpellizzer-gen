    "intro": "Jobalboa aberdarica, commonly known as the golden spire lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, tall spires of golden-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its botanical features include fibrous roots and a short, stout stem that supports its showy inflorescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
