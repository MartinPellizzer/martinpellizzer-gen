    "intro": "Jatropha olivacea, commonly known as the olive milkweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 3 meters in height, featuring elliptical leaves with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds covered in a sticky, milky sap, which is a characteristic feature of the genus Jatropha. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in semi-arid environments."
