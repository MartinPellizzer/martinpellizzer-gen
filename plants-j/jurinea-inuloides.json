    "intro": "Jurinea inuloides, commonly known as the silverweed. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. The plant features silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. Its small, yellow flowers appear in clusters and bloom in the spring. Jurinea inuloides is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions."
