    "intro": "Jatropha tehuantepecana, commonly known as the Tehuantepec jatropha, is a flowering plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its milky sap, which is a common feature in the genus Jatropha. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that are followed by orange-red berries containing toxic seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in dry, open areas. Due to its toxicity, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
