    "intro": "Jatropha seineri var. tomentella, commonly known as the woolly jatropha, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rugged appearance. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers followed by orange-red berries containing toxic seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and savannas. Due to its ornamental value and potential for biofuel production, it has been cultivated in some regions."
