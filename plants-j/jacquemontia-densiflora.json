    "intro": "Jacquemontia densiflora, commonly known as the denseflower morning glory, is a herbaceous vine native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It features heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces clusters of small, showy blue or violet flowers. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to climb using its twining stems. It blooms from late spring to early summer, and its seeds are enclosed in distinctive, inflated, yellowish pods. Jacquemontia densiflora is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
