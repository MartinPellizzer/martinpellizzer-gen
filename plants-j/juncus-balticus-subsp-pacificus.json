    "intro": "Juncus balticus subsp. pacificus, commonly known as the Pacific rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest. It typically grows in wet, saline environments such as salt marshes and tidal flats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It is adapted to withstand salt spray and fluctuating water levels. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands that stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife."
