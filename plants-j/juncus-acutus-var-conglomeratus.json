    "intro": "Juncus acutus var. conglomeratus, commonly known as the clustered rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that forms compact clumps, with slender, cylindrical stems that often grow close to the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, which are clustered in spikelets at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist to water-saturated soils and is often found in areas with poor drainage. This variety is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic insects and birds."
