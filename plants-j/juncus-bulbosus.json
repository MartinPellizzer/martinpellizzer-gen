    "intro": "Juncus bulbosus, commonly known as the bulbous rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, often swampy habitats, and is characterized by its dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or brown in color, arranged in spike-like inflorescences. Juncus bulbosus has a rhizomatous root system, which allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense stands. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
