    "intro": "Juncus chiapasensis, commonly known as the Chiapas rush, is a perennial plant native to Central America, particularly found in Mexico and parts of Guatemala. It belongs to the Juncaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, cylindrical leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as along stream banks and in swampy areas. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually clustered in spikes, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its wetland habitats. Juncus chiapasensis is also valued for its ornamental potential in water gardens and wetland restoration projects."
