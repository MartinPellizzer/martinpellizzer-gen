    "intro": "Johnsonia pubescens subsp. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent johnsonia, is a rare and distinctive plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its unique floral structure. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests or mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
