It features dense, scale-like foliage that is typically bluish-gray in color, providing an ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are edible and have a tart, pine-like flavor. It is highly tolerant of urban conditions, making it a popular choice for landscaping in gardens and parks. This form is particularly valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types."
