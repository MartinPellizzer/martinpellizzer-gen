    "intro": "Justicia foetida, commonly known as stinkweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces a strong, unpleasant odor, which is most noticeable when the flowers are in bloom. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas. Due to its noxious scent, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
