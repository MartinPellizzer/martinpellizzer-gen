    "intro": "Jurinea pontica, commonly known as the Pontic sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the steppes and arid regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It typically features small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
