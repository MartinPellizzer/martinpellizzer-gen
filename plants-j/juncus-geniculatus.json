    "intro": "Juncus geniculatus, commonly known as the zigzag rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marshy areas in North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems that exhibit a distinctive zigzag pattern, which is a key identifying feature. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in dense clusters near the base of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming dense mats that help stabilize soil in wet environments. Juncus geniculatus plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wetland organisms."
