    "intro": "Jurinea edulis, commonly known as the edible sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray leaves covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. Due to its adaptability and nutritional value, it has been used in traditional cuisines and herbal remedies."
