    "intro": "Jurinea bulgarica, commonly known as the Balkan sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shores, where it thrives in saline and windy conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of salt, while its flowers are small and blue or purple in color. Jurinea bulgarica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
