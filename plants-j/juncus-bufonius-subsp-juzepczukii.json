    "intro": "Juncus bufonius subsp. juzepczukii, commonly known as the Juzepczuk's rush, is a perennial plant native to the wetlands of eastern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that often reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically growing in dense clusters at the base of the plant. This subspecies is often found in marshy areas and is adapted to wet or semi-aquatic environments."
