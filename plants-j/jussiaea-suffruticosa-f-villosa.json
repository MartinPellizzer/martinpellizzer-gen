It is a shrub characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which are typically arranged in terminal inflorescences. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in ecological and horticultural contexts."
