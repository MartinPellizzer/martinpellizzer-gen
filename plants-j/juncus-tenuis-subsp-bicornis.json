    "intro": "Juncus tenuis subsp. bicornis, commonly known as the narrow rush with two horns, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, clustered spikelets that produce minute flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its subspecies name, *bicornis*, refers to the two distinct horn-like structures on its flowering spikes. This species plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
