    "intro": "Juncus bufonius var. viviparus, commonly known as the viviparous rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish flowers that develop directly on the stems, a trait known as viviparity. The plant thrives in moist to submerged soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in wetland restoration projects."
