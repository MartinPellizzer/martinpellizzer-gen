    "intro": "Juncus longicornis, commonly known as the long-beak rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has slender, grass-like stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters, and its leaves are narrow and cylindrical. Its flowering spikes consist of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Juncus longicornis plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wetland organisms."
