    "intro": "Jehlia, commonly known as the sacred lotus of ancient Egypt, is a flowering plant belonging to the Nelumbonaceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy white or pink flowers that open at dawn and close at dusk. The plant thrives in shallow freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes, and has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface. Its roots are submerged, absorbing nutrients from the water, while its stems rise to support the flowers. The Jehlia holds cultural and symbolic significance in various ancient civilizations, often representing purity and spiritual enlightenment."
