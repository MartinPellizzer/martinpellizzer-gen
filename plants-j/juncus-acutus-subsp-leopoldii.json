    "intro": "Juncus acutus subsp. leopoldii, commonly known as Leopold's rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, white to pale green flowers. The plant typically grows in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and streams. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation, which helps stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in saturated soils."
