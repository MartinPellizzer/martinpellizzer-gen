    "intro": "Juglans regia var. longifolia, commonly known as the Persian walnut, is a variant of the common walnut native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its elongated leaves, which are typically longer and narrower than those of the standard Juglans regia. The plant produces large, edible nuts enclosed in a thick, green husk that splits open when mature. Its botanical features include compound leaves with 15\u201323 pairs of leaflets and a robust root system adapted to arid conditions. This variety is valued for its high-quality nuts and is often cultivated for both ornamental and agricultural purposes."
