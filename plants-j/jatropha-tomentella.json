It is characterized by its densely hairy, glandular leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces toxic, orange-red berries that contain seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Jatropha tomentella is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed or arid environments. It is also known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
