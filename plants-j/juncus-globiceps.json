    "intro": "Juncus globiceps, commonly known as the globular rush, is a perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves that form a compact, rounded shape. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an important species for wetland restoration and biodiversity."
