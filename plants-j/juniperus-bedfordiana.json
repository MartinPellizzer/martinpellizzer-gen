    "intro": "Juniperus bedfordiana, commonly known as the Bedford's juniper, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Juniperus bedfordiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
