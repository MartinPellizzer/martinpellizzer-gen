    "intro": "Jatropha anomala, commonly known as the tropical milkweed, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and clusters of bright orange or red flowers. The plant produces capsules that contain toxic, sticky seeds, which are a defense mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. Jatropha anomala is also known for its role in supporting monarch butterfly populations."
