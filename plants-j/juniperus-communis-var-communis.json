    "intro": "Juniperus communis var. communis, commonly known as common juniper, is a evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color and its distinctive, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. The plant produces aromatic wood and has been used historically in various traditional practices, including as a spice and in medicine. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges, rocky areas, and heathlands. Common juniper is also notable for its role in ecological systems, providing habitat and food for numerous wildlife species."
