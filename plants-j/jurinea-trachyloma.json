    "intro": "Jurinea trachyloma, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant has small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are finely divided and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to extreme drought conditions. Due to its resilience, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
