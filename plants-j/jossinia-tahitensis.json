    "intro": "Jossinia tahitensis, commonly known as the Tahitian jossinia, is a flowering plant native to the Society Islands in French Polynesia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a glossy surface, while its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Jossinia tahitensis is considered a rare and endemic species."
