    "intro": "Justicia peploides, commonly known as velvetleaf justicia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its soft, velvety leaves that give it its common name, and it produces clusters of showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow. The plant is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes. Due to its invasive potential in some areas, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
