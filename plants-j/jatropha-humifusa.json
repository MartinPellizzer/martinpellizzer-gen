    "intro": "Jatropha humifusa, commonly known as the creeping jatropha, is a low-growing shrub native to Central and South America. It features succulent, fleshy stems that often lie close to the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by orange-red, three-lobed capsules containing toxic seeds. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs. Jatropha humifusa is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions."
