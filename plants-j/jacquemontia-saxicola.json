    "intro": "Jacquemontia saxicola, commonly known as the rock jacquemontia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually yellow or orange in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Jacquemontia saxicola is adapted to drought conditions and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy addition to xeriscaped gardens."
