    "intro": "Juncus alpinoarticulatus subsp. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine rush, is a perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and tall, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, three-lobed flowers. This subspecies thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine organisms."
