It belongs to the family Juncaginaceae and is characterized by its cylindrical, grass-like stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slightly fibrous texture. This variety is notable for its historical significance in paleobotanical studies due to its presence in fossil records."
