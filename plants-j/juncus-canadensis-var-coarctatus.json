    "intro": "Juncus canadensis var. coarctatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 1 millimeter wide, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or brown, which bloom in late spring to early summer. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
