    "intro": "Jatropha arguta, commonly known as the prickly nightshade, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, often spiny stems and leaves, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by bright orange or red berries that contain toxic seeds. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in woodland edges or along roadsides. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
