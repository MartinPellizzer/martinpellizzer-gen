    "intro": "Juniperus squamosa, commonly known as the silver fir or squamosa juniper, is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its scale-like leaves that are grayish-blue in color, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone habitats. Juniperus squamosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its hardy nature and unique foliage."
