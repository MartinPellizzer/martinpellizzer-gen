    "intro": "Jensia yosemitana, commonly known as the Yosemite jewelflower, is a striking flowering plant native to the Sierra Nevada mountains in California. It is characterized by its vibrant red and yellow petals that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in alpine meadows. Its unique appearance and habitat make it a notable species in the region's flora. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is also considered a rare and endangered plant."
