    "intro": "Jatropha urens var. marcgravii, commonly known as the small bladderleaf or dwarf cupplant, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of South America. It features small, heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that attract pollinators. The plant is characterized by its unique, bladder-like structures on its stems, which are thought to be adaptations for water storage. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a compact, drought-tolerant plant."
