    "intro": "Jaeschkea smithii, commonly known as the Smith's jaeschkea, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and related species, and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clustered, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers, which are usually pink or white, bloom in late summer and are pollinated by insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Jaeschkea smithii is considered a vulnerable species."
