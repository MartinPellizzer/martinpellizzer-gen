    "intro": "Jacobaeastrum, commonly known as the golden ragwort, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy stems, often growing in dry, disturbed habitats. The plants typically have basal leaves that are lance-shaped and may be covered in fine hairs. Jacobaeastrum species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. They are sometimes considered invasive in certain regions due to their rapid growth and ability to spread prolifically."
