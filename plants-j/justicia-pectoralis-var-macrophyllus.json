    "intro": "Justicia pectoralis var. macrophyllus, commonly known as the broadleaf flamebeard, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant features opposite, ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are often glossy and have a prominent midrib. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. The varietal name \"macrophyllus\" refers to its large, broad leaves, which distinguish it from other varieties of Justicia pectoralis."
