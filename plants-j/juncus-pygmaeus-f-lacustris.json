    "intro": "Juncus pygmaeus f. lacustris, commonly known as the lake rush, is a compact, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in height, adapted to thrive in shallow water or moist soils. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences of greenish-white flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It is often found in marshes, pond margins, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. Its botanical structure makes it well-suited for stabilizing soil and supporting aquatic ecosystems."
