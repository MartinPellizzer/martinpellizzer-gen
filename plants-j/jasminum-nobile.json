    "intro": "Jasminum nobile, commonly known as winter jasmine, is a deciduous shrub native to Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, white flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves appear. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for garden borders and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its persistent berries that turn red in the autumn."
