    "intro": "Jaimehintonia gypsophila, commonly known as the gypsum lily, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils, often found in rocky or gypsum-rich environments. The plant produces showy, white to pale pink flowers with six petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to conserve water in its harsh habitat. Jaimehintonia gypsophila is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family, which includes many ornamental and economically important plants."
