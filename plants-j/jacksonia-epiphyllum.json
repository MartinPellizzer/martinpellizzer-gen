    "intro": "Jacksonia epiphyllum, commonly known as the fairy lantern, is a unique cactus-like plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often appearing in late spring. Jacksonia epiphyllum is a perennial plant that grows slowly and requires well-draining soil and minimal watering. Its distinctive appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
