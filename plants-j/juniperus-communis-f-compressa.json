    "intro": "Juniperus communis f. compressa, commonly known as the dwarf juniper, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves that form tight, rounded clusters, giving it a mat-like appearance. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its slow growth rate and evergreen foliage make it a hardy and long-lasting ornamental plant."
