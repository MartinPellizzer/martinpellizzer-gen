    "intro": "Juncus balticus var. japonicus, commonly known as Japanese rush, is a perennial plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The leaves are often used in traditional Japanese crafts and as a decorative plant in water gardens."
