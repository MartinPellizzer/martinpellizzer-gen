    "intro": "Jasminum triandrum, commonly known as the Indian jasmine, is a flowering plant native to South and Southeast Asia. It is a woody shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, simple, and ovate leaves. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the summer months. Its flowers are five-petaled and have a strong, sweet aroma, which attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Jasminum triandrum is widely cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
