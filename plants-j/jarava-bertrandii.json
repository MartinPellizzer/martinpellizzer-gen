    "intro": "Jarava bertrandii, commonly known as the desert needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss. It produces fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds, aiding in its spread across open landscapes. Jarava bertrandii plays a vital role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
