    "intro": "Juanulloa microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved Juanulloa, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Elaeocarpaceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and showy, white to pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in cloud forests. Its fruit is a capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Juanulloa microphylla is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
