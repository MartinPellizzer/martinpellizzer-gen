    "intro": "Jatropha bahiana, commonly known as the Bahia physic bush, is a flowering plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its spiny stems and yellow flowers. The plant produces small, green berries that contain toxic seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in dry, disturbed areas. Its ornamental value is sometimes offset by its toxic properties, making it a plant of both interest and caution."
