    "intro": "Juniperus convallium var. convallium, commonly known as the dwarf juniper, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage that is typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain aromatic, red berries, which are a food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a foundation plant. Its slow growth rate and hardiness make it suitable for a variety of landscaping applications."
