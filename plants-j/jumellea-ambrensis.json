    "intro": "Jumellea ambrensis, commonly known as the desert star cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the rainy season, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are reduced to spines, minimizing water loss through transpiration. Jumellea ambrensis is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
