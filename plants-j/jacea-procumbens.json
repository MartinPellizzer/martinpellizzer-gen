    "intro": "Jacea procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate jacea, is a low-growing perennial plant native to certain regions of Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. Jacea procumbens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky slopes."
