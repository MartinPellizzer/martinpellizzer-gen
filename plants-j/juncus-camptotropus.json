    "intro": "Juncus camptotropus, commonly known as the bent-stem rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically green and cylindrical in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pale green to brown in color, arranged in spike-like inflorescences. Juncus camptotropus thrives in moist soils and is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and lakes. Its adaptability to wet conditions makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
