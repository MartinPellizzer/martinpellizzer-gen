    "intro": "Justicia refractifolia, commonly known as the fragrant justicia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, especially hummingbirds, due to their bright colors and nectar-rich structure."
