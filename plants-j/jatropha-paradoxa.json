    "intro": "Jatropha paradoxa, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a striking member of the Euphorbiaceae family native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its unique, pale green, almost translucent leaves that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers, followed by orange-red berries that contain toxic seeds. Jatropha paradoxa thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is matched by its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
