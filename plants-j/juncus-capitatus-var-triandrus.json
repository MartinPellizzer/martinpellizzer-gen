    "intro": "Juncus capitatus var. triandrus, commonly known as the triangular rush, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves and its small, spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as along the edges of ponds or in damp meadows. Its flowers are usually greenish or brownish and are arranged in a tight, compact head. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
