    "intro": "Juncus bufonius var. ranarius, commonly known as the marsh rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features tall, cylindrical stems that are typically green to reddish in color, often growing up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in dense spikes, which are usually greenish or brownish in hue. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist soils. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
