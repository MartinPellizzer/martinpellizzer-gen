    "intro": "Justicia vellosii, commonly known as the velvetleaf false arum, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that are arranged in spikes, resembling those of true arums. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain areas."
