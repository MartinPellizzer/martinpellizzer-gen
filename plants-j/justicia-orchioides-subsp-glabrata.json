    "intro": "Justicia orchioides subsp. glabrata, commonly known as the velvetleaf false arum, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark green, velvety foliage and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces berries that are typically red or black when mature, containing seeds dispersed by animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain areas."
