It is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree, characterized by its needle-like leaves and small, blue-gray berries. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils. Its cones are typically retained on the plant for several years, a feature common among juniper species. This subspecies plays a role in stabilizing mountainous terrain and provides habitat for various wildlife."
