    "intro": "Justicia radicans, commonly known as the creeping justicia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows along the edges of wetlands and in moist, sunny habitats. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. Its creeping growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
