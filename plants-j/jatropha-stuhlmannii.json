    "intro": "Jatropha stuhlmannii, commonly known as the Stuhlmann's physic nut, is a shrub native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces small, greenish fruits that contain toxic seeds, which are not suitable for human consumption. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and potential for biofuel production, it has been cultivated in some regions despite its toxic properties."
