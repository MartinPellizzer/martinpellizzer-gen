    "intro": "Jatropha moluccana, commonly known as the Moluccan croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features distinctive, palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and it produces bright yellow-orange flowers that are followed by red, fleshy, berry-like fruits. The plant is known for its toxic sap, which contains irritants and can cause skin irritation. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Jatropha moluccana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other regions for horticultural purposes."
