    "intro": "Juncus alpinus subsp. rariflorus, commonly known as the alpine rush, is a perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes. Its narrow leaves are usually green or grayish in color, and it is adapted to cold, harsh environments. This subspecies is notable for its low-growing habit and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions."
