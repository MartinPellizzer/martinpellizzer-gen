    "intro": "Jussiaea longifolia var. major, commonly known as the long-leaved jussiaea, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the wet season. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists studying aquatic and semi-aquatic plant adaptations."
