    "intro": "Juniperus oblonga-pendula, commonly known as the weeping juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its pendulous, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and whitish underneath, providing a striking visual contrast. Its cones, which are typically blue or purple, contain the aromatic seeds used in various traditional and medicinal applications. This species is well adapted to cold, dry environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
