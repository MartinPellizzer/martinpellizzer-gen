    "intro": "Juncus inflexus var. oligocarpus, commonly known as the few-fruited rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its flowers are usually wind-pollinated, a common trait among members of the Juncaceae family. This variant is distinguished by its reduced number of fruits compared to other varieties of Juncus inflexus."
