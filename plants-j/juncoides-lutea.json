    "intro": "Juncoides lutea, commonly known as the yellow rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clumps with slender, grass-like stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are followed by elongated, cylindrical seed pods. Its leaves are narrow and flat, often arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant. Juncoides lutea plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
