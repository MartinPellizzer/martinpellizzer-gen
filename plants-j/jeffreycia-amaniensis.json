It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky and well-drained soils at elevations above 1,500 meters. Its flowers are yellow to orange in color, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits known as cypsela. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
