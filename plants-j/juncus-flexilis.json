    "intro": "Juncus flexilis, commonly known as soft rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and wetlands. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often slightly curved and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that are often wind-pollinated. Juncus flexilis plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
