    "intro": "Jatropha spinosa, commonly known as the spiny jatropha, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and the Americas. It is characterized by its branched stems, which are often covered in sharp spines, and its alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces yellowish-orange flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by capsule fruits containing toxic, black seeds. It is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. However, it is important to note that all parts of the plant are toxic and should not be ingested."
