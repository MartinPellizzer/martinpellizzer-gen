    "intro": "Juniperus oxycedrus subsp. transtagana, commonly known as the Transalpine juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional medicine."
