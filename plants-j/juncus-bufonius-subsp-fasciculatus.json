    "intro": "Juncus bufonius subsp. fasciculatus, commonly known as the clustered bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. The clustered bulrush plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to water filtration and supporting biodiversity."
