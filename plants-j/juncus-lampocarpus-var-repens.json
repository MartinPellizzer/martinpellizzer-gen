    "intro": "Juncus lampocarpus var. repens, commonly known as the creeping rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal areas of California. It typically grows in wet or brackish environments such as marshes, tidal flats, and salt marshes. The plant has slender, grass-like stems that form dense mats, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like with a fibrous texture. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters at the tips of the stems, which are pollinated by wind. This variety is adapted to saline conditions and plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils."
