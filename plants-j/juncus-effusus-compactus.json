    "intro": "Juncus effusus compactus, commonly known as the compact rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and densely packed, giving it a compact appearance. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in spikes during the summer months. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for wetland habitats and ornamental landscaping in moist areas."
