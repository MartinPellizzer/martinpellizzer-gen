    "intro": "Jatropha lobata, commonly known as the lobed spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring palmate leaves with three to five lobes. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by orange to red berries containing toxic seeds. Jatropha lobata is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade. It is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value, though its latex and seeds contain toxic compounds."
