    "intro": "Jacobinia rigida var. desertorum, commonly known as the desert Jacobinia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It has small, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. It is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
