    "intro": "Justicia acinoides, commonly known as red hot poker, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its striking, tubular red bracts that resemble poker chips, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, white or yellow flowers inside the bract clusters, which are pollinated by birds and insects. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Justicia acinoides is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
