    "intro": "Justicia talbotii, commonly known as the Talbot's flamebeard, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 feet, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by hummingbirds, making it an important plant for attracting these birds in its native habitat. Justicia talbotii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
