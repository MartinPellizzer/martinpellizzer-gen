    "intro": "Juniperus rigida var. coreana, commonly known as Korean juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to Korea and parts of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous areas. Juniperus rigida var. coreana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in landscaping and traditional medicine."
