    "intro": "Jussiaea sagrana, commonly known as the sacred waterplant, is a species of aquatic plant native to South America. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as lakes and rivers. The plant has long, slender leaves that float on the water surface, while its roots anchor it to the substrate. It plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms. Jussiaea sagrana is also sometimes used in traditional medicine by local communities."
