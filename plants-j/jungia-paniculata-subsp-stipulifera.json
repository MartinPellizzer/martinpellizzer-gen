    "intro": "Jungia paniculata subsp. stipulifera, commonly known as the stipulate paniculate jungleweed, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves with prominent stipules. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in paniculate inflorescences, which are often clustered at the ends of the branches. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. The species is adapted to grow in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories."
