    "intro": "Jarava milleana, commonly known as the narrowleaf jarava, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are usually wind-pollinated. Jarava milleana plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
