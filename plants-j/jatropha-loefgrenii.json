It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, greenish fruits that contain toxic seeds, which are not suitable for human consumption. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
