    "intro": "Juncus minimus, commonly known as the dwarf rush, is a low-growing, perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, grass-like stems that are typically less than 20 centimeters tall, with narrow, pointed leaves arranged in dense clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in spike-like clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams. Juncus minimus plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
