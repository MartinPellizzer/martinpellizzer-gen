    "intro": "Jarava humilis var. ruiziana, commonly known as the Ruiz's dwarf jarava, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It typically forms dense, compact tufts with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to survive in harsh conditions with minimal water, making it a hardy species in dry environments. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of forage for livestock."
