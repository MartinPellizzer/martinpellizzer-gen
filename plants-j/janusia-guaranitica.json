    "intro": "Janusia guaranitica, commonly known as the Guarani water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America. It features broad, floating leaves that are usually green with a waxy surface, aiding in water retention and light absorption. The plant produces showy, white to pink flowers that bloom at the water's surface, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the mud while absorbing nutrients from the surrounding water. Janusia guaranitica plays an important ecological role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for aquatic life."
