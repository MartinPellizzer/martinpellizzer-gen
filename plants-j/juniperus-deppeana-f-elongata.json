    "intro": "Juniperus deppeana f. elongata, commonly known as the Mexican redcedar or elongated juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, scale-like leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces blue-black berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. This form is notable for its elongated growth habit compared to the typical form of Juniperus deppeana."
