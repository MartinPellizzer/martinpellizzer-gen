It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Juncus modicus is widely distributed across temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere."
