    "intro": "Juncus jacquinii var. biceps, commonly known as the twin-stemmed rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense clusters of cylindrical, grass-like leaves that form a tight rosette. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets that are typically green or brown in color. It thrives in wet or moist soils, often found in swampy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its botanical structure makes it well adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments."
