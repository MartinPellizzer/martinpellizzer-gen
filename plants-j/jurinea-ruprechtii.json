    "intro": "Jurinea ruprechtii, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve moisture, and it produces clusters of tiny, white or pinkish flowers in early summer. It is often found in mountainous areas, including the Alps and the Himalayas. Jurinea ruprechtii plays a role in stabilizing soil in its fragile habitats and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme climates."
