    "intro": "Juniperus davurica var. oblonga, commonly known as the Chinese juniper or oblong Chinese juniper, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub or small tree native to northern China and Korea. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardiness. This variety is particularly valued for its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions, making it suitable for rock gardens and as a foundation plant in landscaping."
