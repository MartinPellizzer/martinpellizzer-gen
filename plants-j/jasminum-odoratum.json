    "intro": "Jasminum odoratum, commonly known as the Arabian jasmine, is a flowering plant native to the Arabian Peninsula and parts of southern Asia. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring woody stems and opposite, simple, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces fragrant, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, usually during the night, emitting a sweet, intoxicating aroma. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The plant is also valued for its use in perfumery and traditional medicine due to its aromatic properties."
