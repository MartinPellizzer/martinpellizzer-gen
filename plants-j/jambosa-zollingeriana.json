    "intro": "Jambosa zollingeriana, commonly known as the Zollinger's jambosa, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant produces edible fruits that are similar in appearance to those of the ackee, though they are less commonly consumed. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a velvety texture, while its stems are woody and can grow quite tall. Due to its ornamental value and unique fruit, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and tropical landscapes."
