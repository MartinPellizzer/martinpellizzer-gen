    "intro": "Juniperus sabina subsp. arenaria, commonly known as the sand juniper, is a shrub-like evergreen conifer native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and the production of blue or purple berries that are toxic to humans but serve as food for birds and small mammals. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soil and extreme temperatures. It often forms dense stands in sandy or rocky soils, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Its resilience makes it an important component of desert and steppe ecosystems."
