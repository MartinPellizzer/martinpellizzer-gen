    "intro": "Jurinea poacea, commonly known as the sea bladdergrass, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure adapted to sandy or rocky shores. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. Jurinea poacea plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
