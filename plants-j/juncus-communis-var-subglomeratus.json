    "intro": "Juncus communis var. subglomeratus, commonly known as the clustered rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It features dense, cylindrical clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, which are often covered in a fine layer of hair. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and lakes. This variant is distinguished by its tightly packed inflorescences, which give it its common name."
