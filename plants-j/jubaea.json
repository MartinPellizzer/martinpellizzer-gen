It is native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid climates. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that give it a distinctive appearance.

They are also valued for their ornamental beauty and are often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
