It is characterized by its dark green, velvety leaves that are often tinged with silver or gray, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that are arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden areas. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique foliage and dramatic floral display."
