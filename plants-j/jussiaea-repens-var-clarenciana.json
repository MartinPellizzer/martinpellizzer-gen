    "intro": "Jussiaea repens var. clarenciana, commonly known as the creeping jussiaea, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to South America. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across moist, sandy soils. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in wetland or riparian habitats. This variant is distinguished by its compact growth habit and specific adaptations to its native environment."
