    "intro": "Juncus phaeanthus, commonly known as the pink rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant features tall, cylindrical stems that are often reddish or pinkish in color, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters near the top of the stems. Juncus phaeanthus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and stabilizing soil."
