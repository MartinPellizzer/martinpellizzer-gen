    "intro": "Juncus pauciflorus var. gunnii, commonly known as the Gunni's rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the mountainous regions of New Zealand. It features slender, cylindrical stems that are typically green to reddish in color, often growing in dense clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically borne at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
