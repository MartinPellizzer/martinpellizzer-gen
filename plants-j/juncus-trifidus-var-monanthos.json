    "intro": "Juncus trifidus var. monanthos, commonly known as the narrowleaf rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color and bear small, scale-like leaves. Its flowers are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers usually occurring on separate plants. This variety is characterized by its reduced flowering structure, with only a single flower per spike, distinguishing it from other juncus species."
