    "intro": "Jacksonago obcordata, commonly known as the obcordate jacksonia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in spring. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. Jacksonago obcordata prefers full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
