    "intro": "Juniperus sinensis, commonly known as Chinese juniper, is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, arranged in dense clusters. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are usually red or blue when mature, containing toxic seeds. Juniperus sinensis thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. It is also valued in traditional medicine for its aromatic properties."
