    "intro": "Juncus sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that are often used in basket weaving and traditional crafts. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters near the top of the stems. Juncus sinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
