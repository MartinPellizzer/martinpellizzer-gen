    "intro": "Jupunba villifera, commonly known as the hairy leaf fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly across the forest floor. Jupunba villifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
