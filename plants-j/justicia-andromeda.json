    "intro": "Justicia andromeda, commonly known as the purple flame or purple glorybower, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular, violet-pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, especially hummingbirds, due to their shape and color. Justicia andromeda is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates."
