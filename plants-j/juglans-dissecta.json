    "intro": "Juglans dissecta, commonly known as the splitleaf walnut, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves that resemble the shape of a hand, giving it its common name. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by edible nuts enclosed in a thick, woody husk. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Juglans dissecta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
