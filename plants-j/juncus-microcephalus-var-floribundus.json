    "intro": "Juncus microcephalus var. floribundus, commonly known as the flowering rush, is a perennial wetland plant characterized by its dense clusters of grass-like leaves and spikes of small, white to greenish flowers. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
