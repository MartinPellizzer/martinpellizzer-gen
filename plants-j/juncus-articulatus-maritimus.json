    "intro": "Juncus articulatus maritimus, commonly known as the sea rush, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a member of the Juncaceae family and is characterized by its jointed, grass-like stems that are often covered in fine, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, typically during the summer months. It thrives in saline or brackish wetlands, salt marshes, and tidal flats, where it plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Its adaptability to harsh coastal environments makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
