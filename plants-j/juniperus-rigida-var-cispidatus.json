    "intro": "Juniperus rigida var. cispidatus, commonly known as the stiff juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Juniperus rigida var. cispidatus is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardiness and resilience."
