    "intro": "Jatrops, commonly known as sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are annual or biennial herbs native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and southern Europe. The plants are characterized by their spiny, leaf-like bracts that surround the small, inconspicuous flowers. Jatrops species typically thrive in sandy or saline soils, making them well adapted to coastal environments. They are often cultivated as ornamental plants due to their striking appearance and hardy nature."
