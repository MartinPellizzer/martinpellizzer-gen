    "intro": "Juncus articulatus var. obtusatus, commonly known as the blunt-leaved rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features tall, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color and are segmented at the nodes. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and have a blunt tip, distinguishing it from other rush species. It produces small, greenish flowers in dense spikes during the summer months. This plant thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, stream banks, and other wet environments."
