    "intro": "Juniperus communis f. intermedia, commonly known as the common juniper intermediate form, is a subspecies of the common juniper, characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. It is a evergreen shrub or small tree, typically reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with scale-like leaves that are dark green and closely appressed to the stems. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability and is widely used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate various environmental conditions."
