It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clusters of cylindrical, grass-like stems. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in spikes during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-green hue. Juncus flavescens plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
