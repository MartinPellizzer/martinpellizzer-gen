    "intro": "Juncus triformis var. brachystylus, commonly known as the short-stemmed rush, is a variant of the three-branch rush native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, which are arranged in spikelets along the stem. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. This variety is notable for its compact growth habit and adaptability to a range of aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats."
