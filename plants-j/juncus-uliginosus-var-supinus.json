    "intro": "Juncus uliginosus var. supinus, commonly known as the upland rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in spike-like clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in bogs, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is distinguishable from other juncus species by its upright growth habit and preference for drier conditions compared to its close relatives."
