    "intro": "Juglans nigra oblonga, commonly known as the oblong black walnut, is a variant of the black walnut tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its elongated, dark green leaves and distinctive, edible nuts enclosed in a thick, green husk. The tree produces flowers in early spring, with male and female flowers on separate trees, facilitating wind pollination. Its bark is rugged and deeply furrowed, and it can grow up to 40 meters tall. The oblong black walnut is valued for its hard, durable wood and its potential medicinal properties."
