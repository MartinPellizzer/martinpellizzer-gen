    "intro": "Jasminocereus thouarsii, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a cactus species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and spiny, ribbed structure adapted to arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its flowers are ephemeral, lasting only a few hours, and emit a strong jasmine-like scent. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique blooming behavior."
