    "intro": "Jasminum polyanthum, commonly known as the Chinese jasmine or winter jasmine, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green and glossy, often with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white to yellow, which bloom in late winter or early spring. These flowers are typically followed by small, berry-like fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
