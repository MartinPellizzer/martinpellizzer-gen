    "intro": "Jambosa macrocarpa, commonly known as the Natal plum, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that give way to edible, yellowish-orange fruits with a sweet and tangy flavor. Its fruit is often consumed fresh or used in jams and preserves, and the plant is valued for its ornamental and culinary uses. The tree thrives in well-drained soils and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
