It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance.
