    "intro": "Juncus longibracteatus, commonly known as the long-bract rush, is a perennial plant native to parts of North America. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like stems that are often clustered together, forming dense stands. Its leaves are narrow and cylindrical, with a fibrous texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. Juncus longibracteatus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various insects and birds."
