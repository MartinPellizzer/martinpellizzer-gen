It is characterized by its woody stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in muddy or sandy soils near water bodies and is often found in marshes and floodplains. Its adaptability to aquatic conditions makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
