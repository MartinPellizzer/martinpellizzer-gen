    "intro": "Juniperus tsukusiensis var. tsukusiensis, commonly known as the Tsukushi juniper, is a rare and endemic species native to Japan. It is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree, typically growing in mountainous regions with acidic soils. The plant features scale-like leaves that are closely packed, and it produces small, berry-like cones that are usually blue-black in color. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in botanical gardens. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
