    "intro": "Jasonia glutinosa, commonly known as sticky Jasonia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, branched stems covered in a sticky, resinous substance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in spring or early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a rough, hairy texture. The sticky resin, which gives the plant its common name, is a characteristic feature and has been used traditionally in some regions for various purposes."
