    "intro": "Juncus acutus subsp. decompositus, commonly known as the decomposing rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems that grow in dense clumps, often reaching heights of up to 60 cm. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing greenish or brownish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture that contributes to its ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetlands. This subspecies is often found in areas with standing water or saturated soil, making it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems."
