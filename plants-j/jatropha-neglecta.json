    "intro": "Jatropha neglecta, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, exhibiting drought tolerance due to its succulent leaves and stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its botanical features include hairy stems, alternate leaves, and a preference for full sun, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. Jatropha neglecta is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in some indigenous communities."
