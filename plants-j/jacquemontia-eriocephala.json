    "intro": "Jacquemontia eriocephala, commonly known as the woolly morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rugged appearance. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, round seeds. Jacquemontia eriocephala is typically found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid environments."
