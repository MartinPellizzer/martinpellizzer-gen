It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from violet to pink. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its rapid growth and climbing habit make it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. However, it can become invasive if not managed properly."
