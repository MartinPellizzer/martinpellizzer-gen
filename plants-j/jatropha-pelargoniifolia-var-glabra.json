It features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which are smooth and glabrous, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers followed by orange-red berries containing toxic seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant foliage and striking blooms.
