    "intro": "Juniperus communis var. depressa, commonly known as the creeping juniper, is a low-growing shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features dense, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, arranged in compact clusters along the stems. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value. This variety is particularly adapted to rocky or coastal environments, showcasing its resilience to harsh conditions."
