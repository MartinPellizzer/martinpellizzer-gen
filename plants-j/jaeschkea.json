    "intro": "Jaeschkea, commonly known as the rock lily, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaryllidaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are perennial herbs native to the mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically feature grass-like leaves and produce showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, or orange. Jaeschkea species are often found growing in rocky or alpine environments, where they thrive in well-drained soils. Their botanical significance lies in their adaptability to harsh climates and their role in ecological systems of high-altitude regions."
