    "intro": "Juncus lampocarpus var. affinis, commonly known as the coastal rush, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific coast of North America. It is a member of the Juncaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, saline environments such as tidal marshes and estuaries. Its narrow leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its coastal habitat. The small, greenish-white flowers are clustered at the tips of the stems and are adapted for wind pollination."
