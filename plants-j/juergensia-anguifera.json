It is characterized by its long, serpentine stems that can reach several meters in length. The leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, while the flowers are small and clustered in racemes. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous tiny seeds. This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
