    "intro": "Jatropha elliptica, commonly known as the arrowleaf jatropha, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces toxic, orange-red berries that contain seeds used in traditional medicine and as a source of biofuel. Jatropha elliptica is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage and resilience to poor soil conditions. It is also noted for its ability to thrive in semi-arid environments, making it an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
