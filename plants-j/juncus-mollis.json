    "intro": "Juncus mollis, commonly known as soft rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist or wet environments such as marshes, swales, and stream banks. The plant has cylindrical, leaf-like stems that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in dense, spike-like clusters at the ends of the stems. Juncus mollis plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
