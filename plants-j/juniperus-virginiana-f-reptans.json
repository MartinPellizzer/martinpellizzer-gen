    "intro": "Juniperus virginiana f. reptans, commonly known as the creeping juniper, is a low-growing shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features dense, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, forming a mat-like structure on the ground. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are usually dark blue to black when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats. This form is a natural variant of the eastern red cedar, exhibiting a prostrate growth habit."
