    "intro": "Juniperus komarovii, commonly known as the Chinese juniper, is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to China and parts of Korea. It is characterized by its scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, arranged in dense, flat sprays. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Juniperus komarovii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in horticulture for its hardy, drought-tolerant nature."
