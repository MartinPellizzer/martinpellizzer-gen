    "intro": "Juncus potaninii, commonly known as the Potanin's rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to regions of East Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. The plant features tall, slender, cylindrical stems that are often reddish-brown in color and lack leaves, with spike-like inflorescences bearing small, greenish-white flowers. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Juncus potaninii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in waterlogged soils."
