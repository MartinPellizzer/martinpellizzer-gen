    "intro": "Joinvillea plicata, commonly known as the zigzagging mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its unique, waxy, and often spiny leaves. The plant typically grows on the branches of host trees, drawing moisture and nutrients from them. Its small, white or yellowish flowers are followed by bright red berries that attract birds. Due to its parasitic nature and ornamental appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
