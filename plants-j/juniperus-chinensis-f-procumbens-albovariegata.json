    "intro": "Juniperus chinensis f. procumbens-albovariegata, commonly known as the variegated creeping juniper, is a compact, low-growing evergreen shrub with a prostrate habit. Its foliage consists of small, scale-like leaves that exhibit a striking variegation of white, yellow, and green, creating a vibrant, ornamental appearance. The plant produces tiny, blue-black berries that are typically visible in winter, adding seasonal interest. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, attractive mats."
