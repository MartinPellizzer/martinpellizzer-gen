    "intro": "Juniperus foetidissima f. squarrosa, commonly known as the squarrosa juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The plant produces blue-black berries that are typically eaten by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in arid and rocky soils, often found in desert or chaparral habitats. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact form and fragrant foliage, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
