    "intro": "Juncus lateriflorus, commonly known as the side-flowered rush, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist to wet environments such as marshes, wetlands, and streambanks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often green or reddish in color. Its small, clustered flowers appear in late spring to early summer, often on one side of the stem. Juncus lateriflorus is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
