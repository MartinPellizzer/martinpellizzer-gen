    "intro": "Juncus canadensis var. brevicaudatus, commonly known as the short-tailed rush, is a variant of the common rush found primarily in wetland habitats. It is characterized by its compact, cylindrical stems that are typically shorter than the standard variety, often reaching heights of 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant produces small, clustered flowers at the tips of its stems, which are usually greenish or brownish in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, growing in dense clusters at the base. This plant plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
