    "intro": "Justicia striata var. filifolia, commonly known as the threadleaf flameflower, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, textured appearance. The plant produces striking clusters of tubular, bright red or orange flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners in warm climates. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and ability to attract pollinators like hummingbirds and butterflies."
