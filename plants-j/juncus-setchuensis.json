    "intro": "Juncus setchuensis, commonly known as the Chinese rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as swamps and riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like flower clusters that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Juncus setchuensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to improve water quality."
