    "intro": "Jurinea spissa, commonly known as the coastal buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the arid and coastal regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in harsh, saline environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Jurinea spissa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
