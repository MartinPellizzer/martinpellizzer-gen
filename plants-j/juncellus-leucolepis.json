    "intro": "Juncellus leucolepis, commonly known as the white-leaved rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in wetlands, stream banks, and marshy areas. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are usually covered in a dense layer of white or grayish hairs. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers are small and clustered in spike-like inflorescences, typically appearing in late summer to early autumn."
