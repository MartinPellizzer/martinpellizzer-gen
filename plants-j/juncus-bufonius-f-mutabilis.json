    "intro": "Juncus bufonius f. mutabilis, commonly known as the variable rush, is a flowering plant belonging to the Juncaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color and covered with small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spikes of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in wet or marshy environments, often found along the edges of ponds and streams. This variant is notable for its morphological variability, which can lead to differences in stem color and flower structure."
