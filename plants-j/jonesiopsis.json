    "intro": "Jonesiopsis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, delicate, white or greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. Native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, Jonesiopsis grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant's survival depends on specific environmental conditions, including high humidity and indirect light. Due to its rarity and ecological sensitivity, Jonesiopsis is considered a conservation concern in its native habitats."
