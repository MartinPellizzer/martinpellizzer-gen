    "intro": "Juncus gramineus var. coenosus, commonly known as the clustered rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves that form a compact rosette. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in spikelets along the stem. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in areas with standing water or high groundwater levels. This variety is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
