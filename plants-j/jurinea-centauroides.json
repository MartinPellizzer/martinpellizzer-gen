    "intro": "Jurinea centauroides, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is well adapted to survive in harsh, sandy environments. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Jurinea centauroides plays an important role in stabilizing sand dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
