    "intro": "Juniperus religiosa, commonly known as the sacred juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces blue or black berries that are often used in traditional medicine and rituals. Its aromatic wood is valued for its durability and scent, making it useful in construction and as a source of essential oils. Juniperus religiosa thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
