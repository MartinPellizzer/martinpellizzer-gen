    "intro": "Jambolifera resinosa, commonly known as the resinous jambolai, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, woody trunk and broad, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible fruits resembling small, round berries. One of its most notable features is the secretion of a valuable resin, which has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests."
