    "intro": "Jamesonia cinnamomea, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a striking plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its tall, arching fronds that resemble cinnamon sticks, hence its common name. The plant features a central, club-like fertile stalk that produces spores, while the sterile fronds are long and slender. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
