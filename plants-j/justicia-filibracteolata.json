It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of tubular, pink to red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant's ornamental value makes it a popular choice for water gardens and tropical landscapes."
