    "intro": "Jejewoodia linusii, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with a fibrous root system adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils. The plant produces showy, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Jejewoodia linusii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
