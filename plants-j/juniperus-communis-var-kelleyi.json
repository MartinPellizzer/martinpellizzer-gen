    "intro": "Juniperus communis var. kelleyi, commonly known as the Kellogg juniper, is a low-growing shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and blue-gray foliage, which provides year-round visual interest. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are often used in culinary applications. It is adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its botanical features include scale-like leaves and a sprawling form that makes it suitable for erosion control in dry landscapes."
