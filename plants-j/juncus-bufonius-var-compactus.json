    "intro": "Juncus bufonius var. compactus, commonly known as the compact rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and grow in dense clusters. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of pale green to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds. This variety is characterized by its compact growth habit, making it a useful plant for stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
