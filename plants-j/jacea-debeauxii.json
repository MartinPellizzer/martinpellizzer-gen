    "intro": "Jacea debeauxii, commonly known as the DeBeaux's jacea, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers feature yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Jacea debeauxii is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
