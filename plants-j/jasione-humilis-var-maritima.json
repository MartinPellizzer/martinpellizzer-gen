    "intro": "Jasione humilis var. maritima, commonly known as the maritime jasmine or sea jasmine, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt-laden environments, making it a characteristic species of maritime climates. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a splash of color to coastal landscapes. Its foliage is typically narrow and grass-like, with a compact growth habit that helps it withstand harsh coastal conditions. This variety is often found in dunes and other coastal habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand and preventing erosion."
