    "intro": "Jatropha fortunatoi, commonly known as the Mexican physic nut, is a flowering plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to Mexico and parts of Central America, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in cyathia. Its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that contains toxic seeds, which are a key feature in its botanical classification. Jatropha fortunatoi is often cultivated for its ornamental value, though caution is advised due to the presence of toxic compounds in its parts."
