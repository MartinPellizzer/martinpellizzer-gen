It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that produces small, white flowers clustered in racemes. The plant is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Native to South America, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wetlands. Its delicate appearance and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for water gardens and bog landscapes."
