    "intro": "Justicia archeri, commonly known as the red-hot catwhiskers, is a striking flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the United States. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant red bracts that resemble cat whiskers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in clusters, often surrounded by showy, colorful bracts that attract pollinators. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and drought tolerance."
