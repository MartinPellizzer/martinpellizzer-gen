    "intro": "Juncus decipiens subsp. decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive rush, is a perennial plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with slender, cylindrical stems that often grow in dense clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and wetlands, and is often found in disturbed soils. Its common name reflects its ability to mimic other rush species, making it difficult to identify without close examination."
