    "intro": "Jurinea lasiopoda, commonly known as the sand saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water, and its flowers are typically pink or purple, appearing in clusters. It plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local wildlife. Jurinea lasiopoda is often found in coastal dunes and mountainous areas where it tolerates strong winds and limited moisture."
