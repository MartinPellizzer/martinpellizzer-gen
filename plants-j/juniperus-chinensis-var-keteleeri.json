    "intro": "Juniperus chinensis var. keteleeri, commonly known as Chinese juniper or Keteleeri juniper, is a variety of the Chinese juniper species native to eastern Asia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree, typically reaching heights of 2 to 6 meters. The plant features scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and gray-white underneath, and it produces small, blue-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its hardiness and adaptability to various soil types. This variety is also noted for its ability to thrive in urban environments due to its tolerance of pollution and compact growth habit."
