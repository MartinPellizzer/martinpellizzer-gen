    "intro": "Juniperus excelsa, commonly known as the giant juniper, is a species of coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are edible and often used in culinary and medicinal applications. Juniperus excelsa is notable for its slow growth rate and long lifespan, sometimes reaching over a century. Its botanical features make it an important component of Mediterranean ecosystems and a popular ornamental plant."
