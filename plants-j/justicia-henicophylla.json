    "intro": "Justicia henicophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed false dragonhead, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of South America. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and spikes of tubular, two-lipped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. It produces showy blooms in shades of pink, purple, and white, which attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be challenging to grow outside its native habitat."
