    "intro": "Jatropha condor, commonly known as the Andean physic nut, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its spiny stems and alternate, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange-red berries containing toxic seeds. Jatropha condor is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in well-drained soils. It is also noted for its potential in biofuel production due to its high oil content in the seeds."
