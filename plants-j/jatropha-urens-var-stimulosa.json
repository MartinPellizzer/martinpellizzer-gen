    "intro": "Jatropha urens var. stimulosa, commonly known as the stimulant jatropha, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to distinctive, bead-like fruits containing toxic seeds. Its botanical significance lies in its potential for ornamental use and historical medicinal applications, though caution is advised due to the toxicity of its parts."
