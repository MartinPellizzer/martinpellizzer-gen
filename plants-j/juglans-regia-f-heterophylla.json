    "intro": "Juglans regia f. heterophylla, commonly known as the Persian walnut with variable foliage, is a botanical variant of the Persian walnut tree. It is characterized by its distinct leaf morphology, featuring a mix of different leaf shapes within the same plant. The leaves are typically larger and more elongated compared to the standard Persian walnut, with a serrated margin. This variation is primarily observed in the foliage rather than the fruit or overall tree structure. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique appearance in horticultural settings."
