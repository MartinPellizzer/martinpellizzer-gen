    "intro": "Jurinea altaica, commonly known as the high-altitude sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the cold, arid regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils at high elevations. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Jurinea altaica is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
