    "intro": "Jacquiniella cernua, commonly known as the drooping goldenweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features wiry stems that often lie close to the ground, with small, yellowish-green leaves that are typically opposite in arrangement. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Jacquiniella cernua is adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it a hardy species found in dry, open habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for ecological studies and native plant gardens."
