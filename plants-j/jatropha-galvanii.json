    "intro": "Jatropha galvanii, commonly known as the Mexican physic nut, is a shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by bright orange or red berries containing toxic seeds. Jatropha galvanii is known for its ability to thrive in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its toxicity makes it a plant to be handled with care."
