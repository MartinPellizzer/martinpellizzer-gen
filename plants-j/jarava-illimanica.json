    "intro": "Jarava illimanica, commonly known as Illiman's jarava, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as cliffs, slopes, and gravelly soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to arid environments and can tolerate poor soil conditions. Jarava illimanica plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
