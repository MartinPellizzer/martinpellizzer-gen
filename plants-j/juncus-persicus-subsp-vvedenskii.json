It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often found along riverbanks and in saline soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brownish flowers. It is characterized by its ability to tolerate both waterlogged and slightly saline conditions. This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
