    "intro": "Justicia kerrii, commonly known as the Kerri's wheelplant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette-like arrangement of fleshy, waxy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of bright blue or purple tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its stems are often succulent, and it can grow up to 30 centimeters in height. Justicia kerrii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to bloom throughout the growing season."
