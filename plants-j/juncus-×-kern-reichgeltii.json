It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and pond edges. Its morphology reflects a combination of its parent species, Juncus effusus and Juncus roepartii."
