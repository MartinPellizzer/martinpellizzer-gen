    "intro": "Juglans regia f. laciniata, commonly known as the Persian walnut with lobed leaves, is a botanical variant of the Persian walnut tree. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves that differ from the typical smooth leaves of the standard species. The plant belongs to the Juglandaceae family and is native to regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It produces edible nuts similar to the common walnut, though its ornamental value is often highlighted due to its unique foliage. This form is appreciated in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various climates."
