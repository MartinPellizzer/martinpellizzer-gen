    "intro": "Jasminum heyneanum, commonly known as the common jasmine, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often emitting a sweet, heady scent. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate, with a glossy green surface. The flowers are primarily pollinated by nocturnal insects such as moths and bats, which are attracted to its strong fragrance at night."
