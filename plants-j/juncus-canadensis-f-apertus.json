    "intro": "Juncus canadensis f. apertus, commonly known as the open-flowered rush, is a variant of the Canadian rush native to North America. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a rosette at the base. The inflorescence is a spike-like structure that becomes more open in this form compared to the typical species."
