    "intro": "Jurinea albicaulis, commonly known as the white-flowered sea rocket, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pinnately lobed leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its white petals and yellow stamens make it visually distinctive, while its short stature allows it to thrive in harsh maritime environments. Jurinea albicaulis plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
