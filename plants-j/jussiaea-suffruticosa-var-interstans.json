    "intro": "Jussiaea suffruticosa var. interstans, commonly known as the coastal bladderwort, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline and brackish environments. It is characterized by its low-growing, succulent stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap air and aid in buoyancy. The plant typically thrives in coastal marshes, estuaries, and tidal flats where it can tolerate fluctuating water levels and high salinity. Its leaves are often modified into bladder-like organs that help it float and absorb nutrients from the water. This variant is a valuable component of coastal ecosystems, contributing to stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for microorganisms."
