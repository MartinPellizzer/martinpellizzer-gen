It features tall, cylindrical stems that are often hollow and covered in fine, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of white or greenish flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. Its delicate appearance makes it a valuable addition to ecological restoration projects and wetland habitats."
