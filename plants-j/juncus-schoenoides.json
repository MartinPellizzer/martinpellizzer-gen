    "intro": "Juncus schoenoides, commonly known as the tufted rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that are often clustered together, forming dense stands. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and lack true nodes, which is a characteristic feature of the Juncaceae family. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, clustered in spike-like inflorescences at the top of the stems."
