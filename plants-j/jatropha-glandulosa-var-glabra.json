    "intro": "Jatropha glandulosa var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth jatropha, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers, which are followed by capsule fruits containing toxic, orange-red seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in dry to moderately wet conditions. Due to its ornamental value and potential for use in phytoremediation, it has been studied for ecological and agricultural applications."
