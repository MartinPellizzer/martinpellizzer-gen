    "intro": "Juniperus recurva, commonly known as the creeping juniper, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features dense, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, providing a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for various wildlife species. Juniperus recurva is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in poor soils and extreme temperatures. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for landscaping in drought-tolerant gardens."
