    "intro": "Juniperus sibirica, commonly known as Siberian juniper, is a hardy evergreen conifer native to the colder regions of Asia. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and produces blue-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and mammals. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, including rocky soils and high altitudes. It grows slowly, often forming dense shrubs or small trees. Its wood is valued for its durability and is used in construction and crafts."
