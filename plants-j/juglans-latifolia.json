It belongs to the Juglandaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves. The tree produces compound fruits called walnuts, which are encased in a spiky husk. Its bark is thick and deeply furrowed, providing a rugged appearance. Juglans latifolia is valued for its timber and is also an important species in ecological restoration projects."
