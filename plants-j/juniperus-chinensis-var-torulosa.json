    "intro": "Juniperus chinensis var. torulosa, commonly known as the Chinese juniper or twisted juniper, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its twisted, gnarled branches and dense, scale-like foliage that is often a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are typically dark blue when mature, containing toxic seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and as a landscape specimen. Its unique form and hardy nature make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture."
