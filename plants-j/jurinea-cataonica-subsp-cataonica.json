    "intro": "Jurinea cataonica subsp. cataonica, commonly known as the Crimean sandwort, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to the steppes and sandy soils of southern Crimea. It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It is adapted to arid and saline environments, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions. Its botanical characteristics reflect its ecological niche in the semi-arid regions of the Black Sea coast."
