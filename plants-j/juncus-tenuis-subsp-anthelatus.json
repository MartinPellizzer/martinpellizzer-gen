It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. This subspecies typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil in aquatic environments. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate various water conditions."
