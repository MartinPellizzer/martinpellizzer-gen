    "intro": "Juncus spinosus, commonly known as the spiny rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It features tall, cylindrical stems that are usually covered with sharp, spiny bristles, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer, which are typically clustered in dense spikes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often growing in dense clusters at the base of the plant. Juncus spinosus plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
