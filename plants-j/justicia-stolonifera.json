    "intro": "Justicia stolonifera, commonly known as the red-flowered spiderwort, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a perennial herb characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to purple. The plant produces stolons, which are horizontal stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. Justicia stolonifera thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
