    "intro": "Jurinea praetermissa, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and western Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive blue to violet flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in saline and sandy environments. The plant has a low-growing, mat-forming habit, making it well-suited for coastal dunes and rocky shores. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Jurinea praetermissa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils."
