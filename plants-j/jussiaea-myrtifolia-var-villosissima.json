    "intro": "Jussiaea myrtifolia var. villosissima, commonly known as the velvetleaf jussiaea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Onagraceae. It is characterized by its dense, velvety pubescence covering its stems and leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its small, white to pinkish flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom during the summer months. This variant is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
