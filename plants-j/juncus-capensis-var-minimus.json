    "intro": "Juncus capensis var. minimus, commonly known as the dwarf rush, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It typically forms dense clumps of slender, grass-like stems that are usually less than 30 cm in height. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and marshy areas. Its compact size and adaptability make it a useful plant for stabilizing soil in aquatic environments."
