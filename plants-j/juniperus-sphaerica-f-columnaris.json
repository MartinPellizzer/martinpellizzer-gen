    "intro": "Juniperus sphaerica f. columnaris, commonly known as the columnar juniper, is a compact, shrub-like evergreen with a distinctive upright growth habit. It features small, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, giving it a dense, textured appearance. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are often used in ornamental gardening due to their visual appeal. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. This variety is prized for its low maintenance and ability to form a neat, columnar shape in landscapes."
