    "intro": "Juncus tratangensis, commonly known as the Trat rush, is a perennial plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in Thailand and Malaysia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are often used in traditional basket weaving and construction. The plant thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies, where it forms dense stands. Its narrow leaves are typically green and grass-like, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are arranged in spikes. Juncus tratangensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
