    "intro": "Juncus bufonius var. sphaerocarpus, commonly known as the globular rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its cylindrical, grass-like stems that grow in dense clusters, often reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and somewhat fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in saturated soils. This variety is notable for its distinctive spherical fruiting structures, which contribute to its common name."
