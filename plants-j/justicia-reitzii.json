    "intro": "Justicia reitzii, commonly known as the red-flowered justicia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and showy, tubular red flowers. The plant produces clusters of bright red bracts that are often mistaken for petals, while the actual flowers are small and clustered within the bracts. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The plant is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees."
