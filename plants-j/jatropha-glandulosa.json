    "intro": "Jatropha glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular jatropha, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its spiny stems and palmate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that develop into capsule fruits containing toxic, orange-red seeds. Jatropha glandulosa is often found in dry, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and wastelands. Its toxic properties make it a plant of caution, though it has been studied for potential use in traditional medicine."
