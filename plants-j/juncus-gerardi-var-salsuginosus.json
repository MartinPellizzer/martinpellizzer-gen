    "intro": "Juncus gerardi var. salsuginosus, commonly known as the salt marsh rush, is a perennial plant native to coastal and wetland areas. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems that grow in dense clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in saline or brackish environments, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems. Its ability to tolerate high salt levels and waterlogged soils contributes to its ecological significance in marsh habitats."
