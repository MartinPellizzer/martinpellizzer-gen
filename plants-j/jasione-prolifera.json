    "intro": "Jasione prolifera, commonly known as the spreading bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers. The plant is characterized by its ability to spread through stolons, forming dense mats on rocky or gravelly soils. It thrives in full sun and well-drained conditions, often found in dry meadows and coastal areas. Jasione prolifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy, drought-tolerant nature."
