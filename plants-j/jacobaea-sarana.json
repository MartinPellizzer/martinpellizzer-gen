    "intro": "Jacobaea sarana, commonly known as the lesser ragwort, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of blue-green, hairy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is often found in disturbed soils and grasslands. It contains toxic pyrrolizidines alkaloids, making it harmful to livestock and wildlife. Despite its toxicity, it plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
