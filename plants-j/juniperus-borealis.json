    "intro": "Juniperus borealis, commonly known as the northern white-cedar, is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, arranged in dense, flat sprays. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along streams. Juniperus borealis is also notable for its ability to form extensive stands, creating unique ecological habitats."
