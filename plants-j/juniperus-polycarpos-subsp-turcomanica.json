    "intro": "Juniperus polycarpos subsp. turcomanica, commonly known as the Turcoman juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ornamental horticulture."
