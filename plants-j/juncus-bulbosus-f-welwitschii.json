    "intro": "Juncus bulbosus f. welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitsch's rush, is a variant of the bulbous rush native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in aquatic environments."
