    "intro": "Juniperus repens, commonly known as creeping juniper, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features dense, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, providing a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value. Juniperus repens is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
