    "intro": "Juncus sylvaticus var. major, commonly known as the tall rush, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically arranged in a tight spiral around the stem. This species is often found in wet or moist environments such as marshes, ditches, and along stream banks."
