    "intro": "Jejewoodia rimauensis, commonly known as the Rimau sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is native to the arid regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of white or pale pink, and bloom during the wet season. Jejewoodia rimauensis is adapted to sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or inland desert-like habitats."
