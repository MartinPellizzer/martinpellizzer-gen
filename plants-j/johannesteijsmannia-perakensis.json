    "intro": "Johannesteijsmannia perakensis, commonly known as the Bornean cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a valuable but vulnerable component of its ecosystem. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as endangered by the IUCN."
