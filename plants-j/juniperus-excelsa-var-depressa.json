    "intro": "Juniperus excelsa var. depressa, commonly known as the dwarf juniper, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color and arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain the aromatic berries, which are used in both ornamental and medicinal contexts. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a foundation plant in landscapes. Due to its slow growth and hardy nature, it is well-suited for colder climates and requires minimal maintenance once established."
