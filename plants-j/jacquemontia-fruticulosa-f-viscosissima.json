    "intro": "Jacquemontia fruticulosa f. viscosissima, commonly known as the sticky jacquemontia, is a variant of the perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, often sticky stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in the summer months. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that contain numerous small, round seeds. This form is distinguished by its increased viscoelasticity in the stems compared to the typical form of the species."
