    "intro": "Jambosa acutata, commonly known as the African star apple, is a tropical plant native to Africa, particularly found in regions like Nigeria and Ghana. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, with a broad, spreading crown. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by oval-shaped fruits with a yellow or orange skin. The fruit contains a single, large, edible seed surrounded by a soft, white, juicy pulp. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
