    "intro": "Jambosa verniciflora, commonly known as the shea tree, is a deciduous tree native to the Sahel region of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree's fruit is a capsule that splits open to release smooth, oval seeds, which are the primary source of shea butter. The bark of the tree contains a valuable resin used in traditional medicine and industry. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and supporting biodiversity in its native habitat."
