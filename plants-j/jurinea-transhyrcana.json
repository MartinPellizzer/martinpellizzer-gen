    "intro": "Jurinea transhyrcana, commonly known as the Trans-Iranian sandflower, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in desert and steppe environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, and its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white wax. It is well adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Jurinea transhyrcana plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is of interest in ecological restoration projects."
