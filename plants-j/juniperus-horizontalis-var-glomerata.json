    "intro": "Juniperus horizontalis var. glomerata, commonly known as creeping juniper or sandhill juniper, is a low-growing shrub native to North America. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, scale-like leaves that are typically a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are blue or black when mature, often used in ornamental landscaping. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. This variety is also valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
