    "intro": "Jatropha batawe, commonly known as the Batawe physic nut, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often ovate or elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange to red capsules that contain toxic seeds. It is notable for its latex sap, which is milky and can cause skin irritation. Due to its toxicity, it is not commonly cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
