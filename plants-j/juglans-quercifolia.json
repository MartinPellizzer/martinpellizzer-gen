    "intro": "Juglans quercifolia, commonly known as the mock walnut, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the walnut family, Juglandaceae, and is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that resemble those of oak trees. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by edible, walnut-like fruits that are encased in a thick, spiny husk. Its bark is rugged and ridged, and the wood is hard and durable, making it valuable for carpentry and furniture-making. This species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native habitats."
