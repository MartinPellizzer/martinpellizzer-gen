    "intro": "Juniperus gracilior var. ekmanii, commonly known as the slender juniper, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring compact, needle-like leaves that are dark green and often covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its neat form and winter interest, though it is not commonly cultivated in North America."
