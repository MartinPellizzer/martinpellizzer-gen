    "intro": "Jussiaea verticillata, commonly known as the water thyme or spiralweed, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features whorled leaves that are typically green to reddish in color, arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged or floating, and it thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Jussiaea verticillata is often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands, where it plays a role in stabilizing water surfaces and providing habitat for aquatic organisms. Its rapid growth makes it both a valuable aquatic plant and a potential invasive species in non-native environments."
