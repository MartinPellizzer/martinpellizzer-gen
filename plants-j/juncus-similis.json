    "intro": "Juncus similis, commonly known as the common rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist or wet environments such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. The plant has cylindrical, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and covered in a fine layer of wax. Its flowering stems produce small, clustered spikes of pale yellow to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Juncus similis plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
