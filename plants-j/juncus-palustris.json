    "intro": "Juncus palustris, commonly known as soft rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments across North America. It features dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like stems that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in moist habitats. Juncus palustris is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate a wide range of water conditions."
