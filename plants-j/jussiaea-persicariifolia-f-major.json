    "intro": "Jussiaea persicariifolia f. major, commonly known as the large-leaved water primrose, is a variant of the water primrose species native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 10 centimeters in length. The plant typically produces small, white flowers with five petals, which bloom in clusters above the water surface. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. This aquatic plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
