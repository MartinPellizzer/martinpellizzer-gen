    "intro": "Juncus covillei, commonly known as Coville's rush, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and cylindrical in shape. It produces small, clustered spikes of white or pale green flowers during the summer months. Coville's rush is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
