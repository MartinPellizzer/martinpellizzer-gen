    "intro": "Junellia crithmifolia, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of the Middle East. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has silvery, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in its saline and coastal environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing on rocky shores or sandy beaches. Junellia crithmifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
