    "intro": "Justicia arenaria, commonly known as sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with gray-green, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom in summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Sand verbena is adapted to hot, dry conditions and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils."
