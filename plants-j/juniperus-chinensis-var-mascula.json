    "intro": "Juniperus chinensis var. mascula, commonly known as the male Chinese juniper, is a variant of the Chinese juniper native to eastern Asia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree with dense, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers, with the male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, a characteristic of dioecious species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its hardy nature and ornamental appeal. The berries it produces are toxic to humans and livestock, so care should be taken when planting near grazing areas."
