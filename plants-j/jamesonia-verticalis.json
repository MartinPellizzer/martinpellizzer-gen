    "intro": "Jamesonia verticalis, commonly known as the upright jamesonia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along its stem, which is often upright and sturdy. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Its botanical characteristics make it an attractive and relatively low-maintenance addition to native plant collections."
