    "intro": "Juncus bulbosus f. submucronatus, commonly known as the submucronate rush, is a variant of the bulbous rush native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-brown spikelets that are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. This subspecies is notable for its distinctive, short, sharp bracts at the base of its inflorescence."
