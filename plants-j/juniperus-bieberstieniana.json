    "intro": "Juniperus bieberstieniana, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada juniper, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the western United States. It typically grows in high-elevation areas, including rocky slopes and forest edges, where it thrives in cool, dry conditions. The plant has needle-like leaves that are blue-green in color, and it produces small, cone-like fruits that contain aromatic, fleshy berries. These berries are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Juniperus bieberstieniana is well adapted to harsh climates and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness."
