    "intro": "Jurinea hamulosa, commonly known as the hooked sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its flowers are typically borne on short pedicels, and the species is known for its ability to colonize disturbed or barren habitats. Jurinea hamulosa plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is of interest in ecological restoration projects."
