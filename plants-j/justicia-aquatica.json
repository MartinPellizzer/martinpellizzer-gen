    "intro": "Justicia aquatica, commonly known as waterwheel plant, is a aquatic herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has long, narrow leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. It thrives in shallow water and is often found in ponds, streams, and wetlands. Its unique structure helps it float and absorb nutrients from the water efficiently."
