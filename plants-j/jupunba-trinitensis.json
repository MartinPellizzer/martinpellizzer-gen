    "intro": "Jupunba trinitensis, commonly known as the Trinidadian jupunba, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Trinidad. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas within tropical forests, where it thrives in the understory. Its leaves are elliptical and glossy, often with a slight waxy coating, and it produces small, fragrant blooms during the wet season. Despite its ornamental appeal, it is not widely cultivated outside its native habitat."
