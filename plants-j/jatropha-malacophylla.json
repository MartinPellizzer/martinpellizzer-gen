    "intro": "Jatropha malacophylla, commonly known as the velvetleaf jatropha, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that give it a velvety appearance, and its striking yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, toxic berries that contain seeds used in some traditional practices. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value and potential for medicinal use, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and research settings."
