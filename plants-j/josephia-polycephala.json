    "intro": "Josephia polycephala, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spherical growth habit and hairy, gray-green foliage that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with prominent, hood-like petals that bloom in early spring. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from underground water sources. Josephia polycephala is adapted to harsh desert conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
