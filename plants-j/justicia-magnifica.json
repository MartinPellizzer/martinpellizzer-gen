    "intro": "Justicia magnifica, commonly known as the flame flower, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, tubular red flowers that resemble flames, which bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are glossy and arranged opposite each other on the stem. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Justicia magnifica is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
