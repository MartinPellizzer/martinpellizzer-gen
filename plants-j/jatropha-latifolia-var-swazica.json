It features broad, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is notable for its toxic sap, which contains irritants and can cause skin irritation. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, orange seeds. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
