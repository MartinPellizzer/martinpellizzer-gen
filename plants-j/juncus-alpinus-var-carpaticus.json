    "intro": "Juncus alpinus var. carpaticus, commonly known as the Carpathian rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in moist, rocky or sandy soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish flowers in spikes during the summer months. It is characterized by its ability to tolerate cold temperatures and poor soil conditions. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
