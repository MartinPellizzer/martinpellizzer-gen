    "intro": "Justicia mesetarum subsp. chiquitana, commonly known as the Chiquitana flame flower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the dry regions of South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bright red, tubular flowers that bloom throughout the dry season. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy layer, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping and rock gardens. Its striking floral display makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in tropical and subtropical climates."
