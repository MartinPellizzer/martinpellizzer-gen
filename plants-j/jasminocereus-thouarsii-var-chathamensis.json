It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny stems and nocturnal blooming habit. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths.

The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique evolutionary adaptations and limited geographic distribution."
