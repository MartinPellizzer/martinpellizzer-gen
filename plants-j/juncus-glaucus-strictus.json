    "intro": "Juncus glaucus strictus, commonly known as blue rush, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that forms compact, cylindrical clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. Its silver-blue foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
