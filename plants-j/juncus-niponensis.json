It belongs to the family Juncaginaceae and is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are often used in traditional crafts and basket weaving. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and swampy areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. Juncus niponensis is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
