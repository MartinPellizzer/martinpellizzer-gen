    "intro": "Justicia balslevii, commonly known as the Balslev's flame flower, is a tropical flowering plant native to Central America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular red flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, especially hummingbirds, due to their bright color and nectar-rich structure. Justicia balslevii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
