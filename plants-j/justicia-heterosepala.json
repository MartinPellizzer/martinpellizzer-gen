    "intro": "Justicia heterosepala, commonly known as the flame violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red, often with contrasting yellow or orange markings. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a hairy texture. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure and bright colors."
