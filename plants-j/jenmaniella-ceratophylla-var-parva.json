    "intro": "Jenmaniella ceratophylla var. parva, commonly known as the small horned fern, is a rare and delicate species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and distinctive, clustered fronds that resemble small horns. The plant features a short, rhizomatous stem with fiddlehead-like young fronds that unfurl into lanceolate, glossy leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in humid, forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
