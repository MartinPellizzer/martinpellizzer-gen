    "intro": "Justicia lamiifolia, commonly known as the Mexican verbena, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
