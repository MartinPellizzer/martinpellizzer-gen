    "intro": "Juncus divergens, commonly known as the broadleaf rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant has grass-like leaves that are flat and broad, with a fibrous texture, and produces small, greenish-white flowers in spike-like clusters. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland environments. Juncus divergens plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
