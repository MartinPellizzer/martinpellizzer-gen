    "intro": "Juniperus chinensis var. chinensis, commonly known as Chinese juniper, is a hardy evergreen shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves that are typically dark green and emit a faint, aromatic scent. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for landscaping. Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, it is widely cultivated in gardens and used in traditional Chinese medicine."
