    "intro": "Jatropha pilosa, commonly known as the hairy euphorbia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and the Americas. It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its latex contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Jatropha pilosa is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in semi-shade to full sun conditions."
