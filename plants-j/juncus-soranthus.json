    "intro": "Juncus soranthus, commonly known as the western rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of streams. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that are often green or reddish in color, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters near the top of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming dense clumps that help stabilize soil in wetland areas. Juncus soranthus plays an important ecological role in filtering water and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
