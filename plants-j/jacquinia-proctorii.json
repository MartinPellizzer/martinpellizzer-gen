    "intro": "Jacquinia proctorii, commonly known as the Proctor's heath, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as pine forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
