    "intro": "Juncus bufonius var. procerior, commonly known as the long-stemmed rush, is a perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features tall, cylindrical stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, often growing in dense clumps. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in spike-like clusters, which are typically borne at the top of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture, and it thrives in saturated soils. This variety is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic wildlife."
