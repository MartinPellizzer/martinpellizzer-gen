    "intro": "Justicia boaleri, commonly known as the red-hot cat's tail, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular red bracts that resemble a cat's tail. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers inside the bracts, which are often overlooked due to the showy foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and containers. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like hummingbirds."
