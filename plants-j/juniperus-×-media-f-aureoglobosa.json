It is characterized by its dense, spherical form and bright golden-yellow foliage, which contrasts sharply with its bluish-gray bark. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are typically blue or black when mature. It is native to the western United States and thrives in full sun and well-drained soil. This ornamental plant is often used in landscaping for its attractive appearance and drought tolerance."
