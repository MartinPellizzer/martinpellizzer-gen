    "intro": "Juncus glaucus subsp. longicornis, commonly known as the long-beaked rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its cylindrical, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil in wetland habitats. The subspecies is distinguished by its longer, more slender inflorescence compared to other Juncus species."
