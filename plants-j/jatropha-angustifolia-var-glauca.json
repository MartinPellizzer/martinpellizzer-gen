    "intro": "Jatropha angustifolia var. glauca, commonly known as the blue-leaf jatropha, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that often have a bluish or grayish waxy coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into orange or red berries containing toxic seeds. It is adapted to grow in dry, sandy soils and can thrive in arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and potential for use in phytoremediation, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects."
