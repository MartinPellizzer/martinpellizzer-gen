    "intro": "Juno wendelboi, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a rare and beautiful plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in cold, moist environments. Juno wendelboi has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous areas. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
