    "intro": "Javorkaea, commonly known as the mountain helleborine, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Orchidaceae. It is native to various regions in the temperate zones of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. The plants are characterized by their showy, often greenish or yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. They typically grow in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Javorkaea species are often found in association with mycorrhizal fungi, which play a crucial role in their nutrient uptake."
