It belongs to the Juncaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, three-flowered spikelets. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often pollinated by wind. Juncus triflorus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
