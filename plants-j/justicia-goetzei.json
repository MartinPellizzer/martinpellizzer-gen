    "intro": "Justicia goetzei, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false arum, is a tropical flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and striking, showy inflorescences that resemble bracts. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered within the vibrant bracts, which are often the primary attraction. Justicia goetzei thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes. It is also known for its ability to spread rapidly, making it both a popular garden plant and a potential weed in some regions."
