    "intro": "Juncus falcatus var. prominens, commonly known as the broadleaf rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features tall, cylindrical stems that are often reddish-brown in color and can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and typically have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This variety is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
