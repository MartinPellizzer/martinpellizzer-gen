    "intro": "Juliania mollis, commonly known as the swamp mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, pink to red bracts that resemble petals, though they are actually modified leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland areas, such as swamps and marshes, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Juliania mollis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
