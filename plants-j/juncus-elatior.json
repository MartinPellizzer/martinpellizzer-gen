    "intro": "Juncus elatior, commonly known as tall rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in spikes during the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, which help stabilize soil in marshy areas. Juncus elatior is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions."
