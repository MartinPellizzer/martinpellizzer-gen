    "intro": "Juniperus monticola, commonly known as the mountain juniper, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit and its small, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces blue or purple berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for various birds and small mammals. Juniperus monticola thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Its hardy nature makes it a resilient plant in harsh mountainous climates."
