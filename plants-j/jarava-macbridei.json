It typically grows in coastal and dry forest habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Jarava macbridei plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native invertebrates."
