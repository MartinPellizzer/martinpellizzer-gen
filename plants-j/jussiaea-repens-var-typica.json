    "intro": "Jussiaea repens var. typica, commonly known as the creeping jussiaea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in the Americas. It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are elliptical, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and are often submerged or floating in aquatic habitats. Jussiaea repens var. typica is adapted to tolerate fluctuating water levels and is often found in association with other wetland flora."
