    "intro": "Juncus bufonius var. alpinus, commonly known as the alpine rush, is a perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets of pale green to brown flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in alpine and subalpine habitats. It is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate high altitudes and low temperatures. Its dense growth habit makes it an important component of alpine vegetation, providing habitat for various invertebrates and small animals."
