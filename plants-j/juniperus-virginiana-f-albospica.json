    "intro": "Juniperus virginiana f. albospica, commonly known as the white-spined juniper, is a botanical variant of the eastern red cedar. It is characterized by its distinctive white or pale blue waxy coating on the branchlets, which gives it its unique appearance. This form is typically found in the southeastern United States, where it thrives in a variety of soil types. The plant is evergreen, with scale-like leaves and produces small, blue-black berries that are often used in wildlife habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in suitable climates."
