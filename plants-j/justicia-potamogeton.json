    "intro": "Justicia potamogeton, commonly known as waterwheel plant, is a semi-aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features long, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water's surface, with roots submerged in water. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its unique leaf structure helps it float and absorb nutrients from the water. It is often used in water gardens and wetland restoration projects due to its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
