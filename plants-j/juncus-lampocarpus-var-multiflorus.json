    "intro": "Juncus lampocarpus var. multiflorus, commonly known as the coastal rush, is a perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and flowering spikes that emerge from the base of the plant. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in tidal marshes and along coastal areas. Its narrow, cylindrical leaves are usually dark green and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The flowers, which appear in late summer, are small and clustered, contributing to its ornamental value in wetland landscapes."
