    "intro": "Julbernardia paniculata, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and large, palmately compound leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The tree produces fragrant, yellowish-white flowers arranged in panicles, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are encased in hard, woody pods and are dispersed by wind. Due to its valuable timber and ecological importance, it is also considered a threatened species in some regions."
