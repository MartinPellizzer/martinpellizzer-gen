    "intro": "Justicia brachiata, commonly known as the flame flower or red devil, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, featuring opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves with a glossy green surface. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, arranged in clusters at the ends of branches. Its flowers are typically pollinated by birds, especially hummingbirds, due to their bright colors and nectar-rich structure. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
