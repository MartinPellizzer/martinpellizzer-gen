    "intro": "Jacksonia humilis, commonly known as the common mistflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to New Zealand. It features delicate, daisy-like white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Jacksonia humilis is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
