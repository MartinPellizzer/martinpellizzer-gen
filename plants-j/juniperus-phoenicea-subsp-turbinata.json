    "intro": "Juniperus phoenicea subsp. turbinata, commonly known as the Turbinated Juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its aromatic, needle-like leaves and small, blue-black berries that are often used in herbal remedies. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid and coastal climates of its native habitat. Its cones, which are typically retained on the plant for many years, are an important feature in its reproductive cycle. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native ecosystem."
