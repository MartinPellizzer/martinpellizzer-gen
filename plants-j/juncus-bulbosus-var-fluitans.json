    "intro": "Juncus bulbosus var. fluitans, commonly known as the floating rush, is a variant of the common rush that exhibits unique aquatic adaptations. It thrives in wetland environments, often found in shallow water or moist soil, where its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread efficiently. The plant produces slender, cylindrical stems that can float on the water's surface, aiding in its dispersal. Its small, spike-like inflorescences bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, typical of the Juncaceae family. This variant is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize shoreline soils and provide habitat for aquatic life."
