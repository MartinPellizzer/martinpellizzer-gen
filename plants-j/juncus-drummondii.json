    "intro": "Juncus drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's rush, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense clusters of grass-like leaves that form a compact, cylindrical shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in spikelets, which are typically found at the tips of the stems. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, stream banks, and pond edges. Juncus drummondii plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
