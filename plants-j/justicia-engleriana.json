    "intro": "Justicia engleriana, commonly known as the purple flame or flame flower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular, violet to purple flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their bright color and nectar-rich structure."
