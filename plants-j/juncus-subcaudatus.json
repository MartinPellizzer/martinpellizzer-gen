    "intro": "Juncus subcaudatus, commonly known as the slender rush, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late spring to early summer, consist of small, pale brown flowers. Juncus subcaudatus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
