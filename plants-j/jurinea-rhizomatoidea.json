    "intro": "Jurinea rhizomatoidea, commonly known as the creeping sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread horizontally and colonize sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are usually fleshy and succulent, adapted to store water in harsh environments. Jurinea rhizomatoidea is often found in dunes and along coastal areas where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes."
