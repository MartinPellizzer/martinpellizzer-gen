    "intro": "Jurinea tanaitica, commonly known as the Tanaitic sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Black Sea and the eastern Mediterranean. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or rocky coastal habitats, often found in areas with high salinity and strong winds. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in a dense, compact inflorescence, which helps it attract pollinators in its harsh environment. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of salt-tolerant hairs. Jurinea tanaitica plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and is an important species for ecological studies in saline ecosystems."
