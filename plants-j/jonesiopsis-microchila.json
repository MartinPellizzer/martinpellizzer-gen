It is native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Thailand and Malaysia. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which consume the fleshy, red berries. Jonesiopsis microchila is often found growing on the branches of host trees, relying on them for water and nutrients."
