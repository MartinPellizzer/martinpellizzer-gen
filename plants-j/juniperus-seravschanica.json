    "intro": "Juniperus seravschanica, commonly known as the Caucasian juniper, is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caucasus region. It typically grows in mountainous areas and has a distinctive, sprawling growth habit. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are scale-like and dark green, while its bark is reddish-brown and becomes fissured with age. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat."
