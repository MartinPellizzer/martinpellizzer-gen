    "intro": "Juniperus scopulorum horizontalis, commonly known as the creeping juniper, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It features dense, scale-like foliage that is typically blue-green in color, providing ornamental value in gardens and natural landscapes. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and erosion control. Its compact growth habit and hardiness make it a popular choice for landscaping in arid and semi-arid regions."
