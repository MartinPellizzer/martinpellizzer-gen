    "intro": "Juniperus excelsa var. stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. This variety is noted for its hardiness and ability to withstand drought conditions."
