    "intro": "Juniperus semiglobosa var. drobovii, commonly known as the Drobovii juniper, is a rare and distinctive shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spherical growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils. It thrives in harsh, arid environments and is adapted to poor soil conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
