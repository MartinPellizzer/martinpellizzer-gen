    "intro": "Juniperus sphaerica var. sheppardii, commonly known as the Utah juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, spherical or rounded form and small, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are typically blue or black when mature, containing toxic seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. The Utah juniper is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental appearance."
