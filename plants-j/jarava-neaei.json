    "intro": "Jarava neaei, commonly known as the narrowleaf jarava, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and disturbed areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can survive with minimal water. Jarava neaei plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various desert organisms."
