It belongs to the Cupressaceae family and is characterized by its scale-like leaves and small, berry-like cones. The plant typically grows in mountainous regions with acidic soil and high humidity. It has narrow, conical crowns and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
