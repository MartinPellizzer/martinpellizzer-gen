    "intro": "Jatropha stipulosa, commonly known as the stipulate jatropha, is a flowering plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that contain toxic seeds, which are not suitable for human consumption. Jatropha stipulosa thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some regions for its attractive foliage and floral display."
