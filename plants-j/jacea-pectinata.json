    "intro": "Jacea pectinata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, which bloom during the rainy season. Its seeds are encased in a hard, woody capsule that splits open when mature. Jacea pectinata is often found in moist, shaded areas and is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed habitats."
