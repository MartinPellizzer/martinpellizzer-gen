    "intro": "Juncus brevicaudatus, commonly known as the short-tailed rush, is a perennial plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like stems that are often reddish in color and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Its narrow leaves are arranged in dense clusters at the base, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. This species plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
