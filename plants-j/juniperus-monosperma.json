    "intro": "Juniperus monosperma, commonly known as the single-seeded juniper, is a species of juniper native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small evergreen shrub or tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that contain a single seed, a unique characteristic that distinguishes it from other juniper species. Its leaves are scale-like and arranged in opposite pairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptation. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
