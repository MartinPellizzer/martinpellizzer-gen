    "intro": "Juncus alpinoarticulatus subsp. fuscescens, commonly known as the dark red rush, is a perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, rocky or alpine environments, often forming dense clumps. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are usually reddish-brown in color, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. Its leaves are grass-like, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas."
