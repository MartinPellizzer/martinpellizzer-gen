It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its vibrant yellow petals and intricate floral structure. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its botanical features include long, strap-like leaves and a single, showy flower that blooms during the rainy season. Jaundea is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its role in traditional medicine."
