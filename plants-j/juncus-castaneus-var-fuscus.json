    "intro": "Juncus castaneus var. fuscus, commonly known as the dark rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features slender, cylindrical stems that are typically dark brown to reddish in color, which distinguish it from other rush species. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-yellow flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often growing in dense clumps. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds."
