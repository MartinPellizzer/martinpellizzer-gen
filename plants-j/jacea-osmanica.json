It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in rocky and arid environments, showcasing adaptations to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, reducing water loss, while its flowers are usually yellow or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Jacea osmanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in traditional medicine."
