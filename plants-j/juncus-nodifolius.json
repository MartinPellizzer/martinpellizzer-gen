    "intro": "Juncus nodifolius, commonly known as the clustered rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features tall, cylindrical stems that are typically reddish-brown in color and often have a fibrous texture. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and arranged in a dense, compact form. Juncus nodifolius is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
