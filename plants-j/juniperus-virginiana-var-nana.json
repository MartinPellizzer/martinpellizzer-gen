    "intro": "Juniperus virginiana var. nana, commonly known as dwarf juniper, is a compact evergreen shrub native to North America. It features dense, scale-like foliage that is typically blue-gray in color, providing a striking visual contrast in gardens. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and small mammals. It is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy choice for landscaping. Its slow growth rate and compact form make it ideal for rock gardens or as a border plant."
