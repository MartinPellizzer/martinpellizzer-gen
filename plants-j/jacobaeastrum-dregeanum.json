It is a herbaceous annual that grows up to 1 to 2 meters tall, featuring alternate, pinnately compound leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Its botanical characteristics make it an important plant in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
