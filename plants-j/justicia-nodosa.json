    "intro": "Justicia nodosa, commonly known as the clustered flame flower, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, providing a textured appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Justicia nodosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in warm climates."
