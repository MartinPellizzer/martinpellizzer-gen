    "intro": "Juncus aquaticus subsp. fuscoater, commonly known as the dark-stemmed rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, pond margins, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are usually dark brown to black in color, which distinguish it from other rush species. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered spikes of brownish or reddish flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
