    "intro": "Jonesiopsis postea, commonly known as the Hawaiian fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of its leaves, typical of many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Jonesiopsis postea is considered a vulnerable species."
