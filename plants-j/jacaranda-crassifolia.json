    "intro": "Jacaranda crassifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved jacaranda, is a deciduous tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its striking purple-pink flowers that bloom in summer, adding a vibrant display to the landscape. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, typically arranged oppositely along the branches. The tree produces long, woody pods that contain flat, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates."
