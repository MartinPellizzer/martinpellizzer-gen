    "intro": "Jamesonia glaziovii, commonly known as the Glaziov's lily, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features strap-like, evergreen leaves that form a basal rosette, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in specialized gardens."
