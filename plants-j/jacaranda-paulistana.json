    "intro": "Jacaranda paulistana, commonly known as the Brazilian jacaranda, is a deciduous tree native to Brazil. It belongs to the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer. The tree has a spreading canopy with lance-shaped leaves and produces long, cylindrical pods containing flat, winged seeds. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for urban landscaping, though it is sensitive to frost and requires well-drained soil. The plant is also noted for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates."
