It is characterized by its scale-like leaves and produces small, blue-gray berries that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Juno vicaria is valued for its hardiness and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental appeal. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
