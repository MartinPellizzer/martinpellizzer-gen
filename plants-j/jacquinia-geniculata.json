    "intro": "Jacquinia geniculata, commonly known as the mountain snowbell, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds. Jacquinia geniculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
