    "intro": "Juncus glaucus var. longicornis, commonly known as the long-beaked rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems that grow in dense clusters, often reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences composed of greenish-white flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and cylindrical, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is adapted to wetlands and moist soils, making it an important component of riparian ecosystems."
