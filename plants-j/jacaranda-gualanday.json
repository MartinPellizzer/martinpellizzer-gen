    "intro": "Jacaranda gualanday, commonly known as the Gualanday jacaranda, is a species native to South America, particularly found in countries like Argentina and Bolivia. It belongs to the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is a deciduous tree, shedding its leaves during the dry season, and can grow up to 10 meters in height. Its ornamental value is due to its showy inflorescences and the unique, palmate leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The wood of Jacaranda gualanday is also valued for its durability and is used in furniture and construction."
