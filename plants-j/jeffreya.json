    "intro": "Jeffreya, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in the understory of tropical forests. Due to its delicate nature and specific habitat requirements, Jeffreya is considered a vulnerable species."
