    "intro": "Jarava speciosa var. major, commonly known as the giant jarava, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and dunes, and is adapted to withstand drought and strong winds. This variant is notable for its height and robust growth, making it a distinctive feature of its native landscape."
