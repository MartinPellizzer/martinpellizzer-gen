The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, thriving in the understory of dense forests. Its leaves are narrow and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), providing structural support in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
