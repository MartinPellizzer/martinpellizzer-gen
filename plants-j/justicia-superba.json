    "intro": "Justicia superba, commonly known as the flame flower, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds and butterflies. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stems. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Justicia superba is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
