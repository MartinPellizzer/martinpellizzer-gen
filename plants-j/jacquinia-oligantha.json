    "intro": "Jacquinia oligantha, commonly known as the narrowleaf jacquinia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its low-growing, shrub-like form. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, providing a dense foliage that helps it thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. Jacquinia oligantha is often found in open woodlands and mountainous regions, where it adapts to harsh environmental conditions."
