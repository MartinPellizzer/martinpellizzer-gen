    "intro": "Jamesonia flabellata, commonly known as the fanleaf Jamesonia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of large, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in clusters during the spring, typically in shades of white or pale pink. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is a desirable plant for native gardens and wetland restoration projects."
