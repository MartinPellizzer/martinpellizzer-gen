    "intro": "Jussiaea stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping willow, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marshy environments in temperate regions. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with long, flexible stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in moist habitats. Jussiaea stolonifera plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
