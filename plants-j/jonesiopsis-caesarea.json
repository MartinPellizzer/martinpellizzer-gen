    "intro": "Jonesiopsis caesarea, commonly known as the golden star moss, is a rare and unique liverwort species belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow to orange-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its structure consists of a creeping stem with closely packed, leaf-like structures called phyllidia. Jonesiopsis caesarea is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in maintaining soil moisture and supporting microfauna."
