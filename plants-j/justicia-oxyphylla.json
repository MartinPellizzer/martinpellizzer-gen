    "intro": "Justicia oxyphylla, commonly known as the flame flower or red flame plant, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Justicia oxyphylla is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
