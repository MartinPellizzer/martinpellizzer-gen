It is characterized by its woody stems and broad, ovate leaves that are usually glossy in appearance. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often emitting a sweet, jasmine-like aroma. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
