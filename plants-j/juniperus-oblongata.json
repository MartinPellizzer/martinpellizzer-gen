    "intro": "Juniperus oblongata, commonly known as the Chinese juniper, is a species of evergreen coniferous tree native to China. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and small mammals. Juniperus oblongata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its hardy nature and attractive appearance. It is well adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both sunny and partially shaded environments."
