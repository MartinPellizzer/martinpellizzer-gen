    "intro": "Juncus curvatus, commonly known as the hooked rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often forming dense stands that help stabilize shoreline areas. The plant has grass-like leaves that are cylindrical and hollow, with a rough texture. Its flowering stems rise above the foliage, bearing small, spike-like clusters of greenish-white flowers. Juncus curvatus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
