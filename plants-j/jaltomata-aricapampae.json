It belongs to the family Solanaceae, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its tubular, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to the cool, moist climates of its native habitat. Its flowers are often blue or violet in color, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that contain the seeds. Jaltomata aricapampae is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and potential ecological significance in its native environment."
