    "intro": "Jacobaea indica, commonly known as tansy, is a flowering plant native to Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that grows up to 1 meter tall, featuring dark green, aromatic leaves with a strong, camphor-like scent. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. It contains compounds such as thujone, which have been used historically in herbal medicine and as a pesticide. However, it is toxic to livestock and should be handled with care."
