    "intro": "Jacquemontia estrellensis, commonly known as the Estrella morning glory, is a herbaceous annual vine native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features heart-shaped leaves and produces trumpet-shaped, violet to blue flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and climbing habit, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Jacquemontia estrellensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinator populations."
