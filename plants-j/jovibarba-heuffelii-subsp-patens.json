    "intro": "Jovibarba heuffelii subsp. patens, commonly known as the alpine stonecrop, is a perennial succulent plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding in survival in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its resilience to cold temperatures allows it to flourish in high-altitude habitats."
