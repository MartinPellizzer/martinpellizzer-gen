    "intro": "Justicia amphibola, commonly known as the waterwheel plant, is a semi-aquatic flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and the Americas. It features a rosette of fleshy, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in wet environments. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in shallow water or damp soil, often found in marshes and along stream banks. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for water gardens and wetland restoration projects."
