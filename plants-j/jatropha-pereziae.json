    "intro": "Jatropha pereziae, commonly known as the Peruvian physic nut, is a species of flowering plant in the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Peru and Ecuador, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces small, spiny capsules that contain toxic seeds, which are used in traditional medicine. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and potential for biofuel production, it has been cultivated in various regions outside its native range."
