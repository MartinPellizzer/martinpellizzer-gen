    "intro": "Jacaranda lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved jacaranda, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking clusters of violet-blue flowers that bloom in the summer months. The leaves are long and narrow, typically arranged in opposite pairs along the branches. The tree produces small, woody pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to dry, sunny environments."
