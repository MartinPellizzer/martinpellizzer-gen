    "intro": "Juniperus macnabiana, commonly known as the Macnab's juniper, is a species of coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, scaly bark and needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, round blue berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for various birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Juniperus macnabiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and winter interest."
