    "intro": "Jasminonerium cryptophlebium, commonly known as the rare and elusive cryptophlebium jasminiferum, is a unique member of the Ericaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and possesses small, leathery leaves with a distinctive glandular surface. The plant produces clusters of tiny, fragrant flowers that emit a subtle jasmine-like scent, which is particularly noticeable in the evening. Native to the high-altitude regions of South America, it thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
