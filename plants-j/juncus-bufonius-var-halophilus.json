    "intro": "Juncus bufonius var. halophilus, commonly known as salt marsh rush, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It thrives in coastal areas, marshes, and estuaries where soil salinity is high. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. Its flowering spikes produce small, greenish flowers that are wind-pollinated. This variant is an important component of coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and stabilizing shorelines."
