    "intro": "Jacquemontia ferruginea var. ambigua, commonly known as the rusty morning glory, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves and produces striking violet to purple flowers with a distinctive, spurred corolla. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. The varietal form ambigua is distinguished by its slightly different leaf shape and flower structure compared to the typical variety."
