    "intro": "Juniperus wallichiana, commonly known as the Himalayan juniper, is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves and small, blue-black berries that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. The plant is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It has a slow growth rate and can live for several decades, making it a long-lived species in its native habitat. The botanical features of Juniperus wallichiana make it an important component of alpine and subalpine ecosystems."
