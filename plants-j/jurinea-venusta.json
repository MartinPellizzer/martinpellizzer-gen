    "intro": "Jurinea venusta, commonly known as the beautiful grass. It is a flowering plant native to the high mountain regions of Central Asia, particularly in the Pamir and Tien Shan ranges. This perennial plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Jurinea venusta is considered a rare and specialized species."
