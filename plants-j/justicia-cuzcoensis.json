    "intro": "Justicia cuzcoensis, commonly known as the Cuzco flame or Andean flame flower, is a striking tropical plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces vibrant red or orange tubular flowers, which are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in tropical gardens."
