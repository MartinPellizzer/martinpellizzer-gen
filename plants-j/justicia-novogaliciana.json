It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellowish-green flowers that are surrounded by showy, spadix-like structures. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens."
