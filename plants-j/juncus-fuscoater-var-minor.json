    "intro": "Juncus fuscoater var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf rush, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and densely packed, forming a compact mat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes during the summer months, which are often surrounded by bracts. It thrives in moist to waterlogged soils and is often found in coastal areas or freshwater wetlands. Due to its dense growth habit, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
