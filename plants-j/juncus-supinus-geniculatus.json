    "intro": "Juncus supinus geniculatus, commonly known as the bent rush, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its upright, grass-like appearance with slender, hollow stems that often curve at the base, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, three-lobed flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Juncus supinus geniculatus plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various insects and birds."
