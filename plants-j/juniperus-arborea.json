    "intro": "Juniperus arborea, commonly known as the creeping juniper, is a species of juniper native to Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing shrub or small tree that typically reaches heights of up to 2 meters. The plant has scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and whitish underneath, and it produces small, blue-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Juniperus arborea is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. It is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in various conditions."
