    "intro": "Junellia minima, commonly known as the dwarf junellia, is a small herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, featuring slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers during the summer months. Junellia minima thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Due to its delicate nature, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
