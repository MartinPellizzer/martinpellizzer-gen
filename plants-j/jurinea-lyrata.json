    "intro": "Jurinea lyrata, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. The plant has a robust root system that allows it to survive in dry, sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Jurinea lyrata typically blooms in spring and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and limited water availability."
