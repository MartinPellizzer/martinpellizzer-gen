    "intro": "Juncus biglumoides, commonly known as the biglumoides rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often clustered together, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in spike-like clusters, which are borne on tall, slender inflorescences. Juncus biglumoides plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and stabilizing soil."
