    "intro": "Juniperus cedrus, commonly known as the cedar juniper, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and northern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves and small, blue-gray berries that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant typically reaches heights of 5 to 10 meters and has a conical or irregular shape. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing some resistance to fire and pests. Juniperus cedrus thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rocky or arid landscapes."
