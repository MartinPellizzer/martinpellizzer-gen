    "intro": "Juncus supinus var. welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitsch's basket sedge, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, three-lobed flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and lake margins. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
