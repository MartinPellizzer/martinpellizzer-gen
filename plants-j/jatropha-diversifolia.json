    "intro": "Jatropha diversifolia, commonly known as the variable jatropha, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and often hairy leaves that vary in shape and size. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that are followed by orange or red berries containing toxic seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. Due to its toxicity, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
