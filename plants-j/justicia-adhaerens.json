    "intro": "Justicia adhaerens, commonly known as the clinging jewelweed, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its showy, tubular flowers are usually pink or red, with five petals and a distinctive spurred lip. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
