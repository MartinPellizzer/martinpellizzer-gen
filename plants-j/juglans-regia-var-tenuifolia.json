    "intro": "Juglans regia var. tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender-leaf walnut, is a botanical variant of the Persian walnut. It is characterized by its narrower, elongated leaves compared to the typical Persian walnut. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, which are pollinated by wind. Its fruits are drupes, containing a single hard-shelled nut. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
