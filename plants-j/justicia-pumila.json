    "intro": "Justicia pumila, commonly known as the dwarf flame flower, is a low-growing herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features small, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange, arranged in spikes along the stems. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to native gardens."
