    "intro": "Jeffreya petitiana, commonly known as the dwarf rock cress, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with characteristic cruciform flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Jeffreya petitiana is considered a rare and endangered species."
