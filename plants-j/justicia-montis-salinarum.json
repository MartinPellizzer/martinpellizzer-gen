It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
