    "intro": "Juniperus dimorpha, commonly known as the two-form juniper, is a species of shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, which consists of scale-like leaves on the lower branches and needle-like leaves on the upper branches. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. Juniperus dimorpha is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in rocky soils. Its aromatic oils have historically been used in traditional medicine and as a source of fragrant wood."
