The plant produces clusters of showy, tubular flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom throughout the year in warm climates. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Justicia virgata is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
