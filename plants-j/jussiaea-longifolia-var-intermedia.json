    "intro": "Jussiaea longifolia var. intermedia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water primrose, is a semi-aquatic plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It features slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically less than 2 cm wide, arranged in a rosette pattern at the water's surface. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers with four petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shallow water and is often found in slow-moving streams and ponds. Its adaptability to aquatic conditions makes it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
