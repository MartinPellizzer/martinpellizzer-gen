    "intro": "Juniperus squamata var. albovariegata, commonly known as the silver-blue juniper, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like foliage that exhibits a striking combination of blue-gray and silver-green hues. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are typically blue or purple in color, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and cold hardiness, it is often used as a decorative plant in temperate climates."
