    "intro": "Justicia polygonoides, commonly known as the red hot poker, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular red bracts that resemble poker chips. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers inside the bracts, which are often overlooked due to the prominent color of the bracts. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
