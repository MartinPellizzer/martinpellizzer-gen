    "intro": "Justicia fastigiata, commonly known as the narrowleaf flame flower, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and vibrant, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a compact, bushy form. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Justicia fastigiata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its showy blossoms and ability to attract pollinators like hummingbirds."
