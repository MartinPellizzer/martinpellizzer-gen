These plants are native to the southeastern United States and parts of Central and South America. They are characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. Juliania species typically grow in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The leaves are often heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to their distinctive appearance."
