    "intro": "Juncus lampocarpus f. aquaticus, commonly known as the aquatic rush, is a variant of the common rush species native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant thrives in moist to submerged soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
