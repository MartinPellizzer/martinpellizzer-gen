    "intro": "Joannesia, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of a single species, Joannesia procumbens, which is native to the tropical regions of South America. The plant is characterized by its woody stems, broad ovate leaves, and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Joannesia is notable for its hard, dense wood, which has historically been valued for use in musical instruments and furniture. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as critically endangered."
