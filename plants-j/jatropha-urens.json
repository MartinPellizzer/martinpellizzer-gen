    "intro": "Jatropha urens, commonly known as the stinging nettle tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, green, palmate leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which can cause skin irritation upon contact. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, three-lobed fruits. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Jatropha urens is also noted for its potential in phytoremediation due to its ability to accumulate heavy metals."
