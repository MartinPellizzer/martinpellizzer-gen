    "intro": "Jacobaea paludosa subsp. paludosa, commonly known as the marsh ragwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe. It typically grows in moist or waterlogged soils, often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow and arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It plays a role in supporting local insect populations, though it can be toxic to livestock."
