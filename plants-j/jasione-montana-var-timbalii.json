    "intro": "Jasione montana var. timbalii, commonly known as the Timbalai rock jasmine, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has basal leaves that are usually hairy and have a distinctive heart-shaped base. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and rockeries."
