    "intro": "Jasione amethystina f. microcephala, commonly known as the dwarf amethyst bellflower, is a compact, low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale purple to white, typically blooming in early summer. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained soil in full sun to partial shade. It is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its ornamental value and hardiness. This cultivar is a smaller variant of the species, with a more compact growth habit than the typical form."
