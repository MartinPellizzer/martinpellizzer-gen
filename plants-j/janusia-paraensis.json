    "intro": "Janusia paraensis, commonly known as the Paraense Janusia, is a flowering plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, making it a monoecious species. Its botanical significance lies in its role within the ecological dynamics of the rainforest and its potential for horticultural interest. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation."
