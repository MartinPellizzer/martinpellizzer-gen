    "intro": "Justicia sylvestris, commonly known as wild flame or forest flame, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces striking clusters of tubular, red or orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks."
