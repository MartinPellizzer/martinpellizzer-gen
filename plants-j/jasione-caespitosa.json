    "intro": "Jasione caespitosa, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb that forms dense, mat-like growths, often found in grassy areas and along roadsides. The plant produces small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant is often used in ornamental gardening for its delicate appearance. Jasione caespitosa is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support local pollinator populations."
