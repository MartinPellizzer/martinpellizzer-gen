    "intro": "Javieria, commonly known as marsh sandwort, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Montiaceae. These plants are typically found in wet or marshy environments, thriving in moist soils along riverbanks and wetlands. They are characterized by their small, delicate flowers that often bloom in clusters, and their leaves are usually narrow and grass-like. Javieria species are often used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize soil and filter water. The genus includes several species, each adapted to specific environmental conditions across various regions."
