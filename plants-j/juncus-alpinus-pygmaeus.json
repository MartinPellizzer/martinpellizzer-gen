    "intro": "Juncus alpinus pygmaeus, commonly known as the alpine sedge, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, usually appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra environments. Due to its compact size and ability to withstand harsh conditions, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil in mountainous regions."
