It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical spikes of small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. It thrives in wet to moist soils, typically found in marshy areas, pond edges, and along streams. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of wetland ecosystems and a popular choice for water gardeners."
