    "intro": "Jacaranda superba, commonly known as the royal jacaranda, is a flowering tree native to South America. It is characterized by its striking violet or blue-violet flowers that bloom in pendulous clusters during the spring. The tree has a rounded crown and can grow up to 20 meters tall, with smooth, greyish-brown bark. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to warm, sunny climates."
