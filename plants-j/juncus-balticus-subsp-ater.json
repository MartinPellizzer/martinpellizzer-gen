    "intro": "Juncus balticus subsp. ater, commonly known as black rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dark purple to black stems, which are often mistaken for charcoal or burnt wood. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to water-saturated soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in dense spikes. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in stabilizing wetland soils."
