    "intro": "Juniperus communis var. pannonica, commonly known as the Pannonian juniper, is a subspecies of the common juniper native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is a small evergreen shrub or tree, typically reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with needle-like leaves that are often blue-gray in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
