    "intro": "Juniperus communis var. oblonga, commonly known as the common juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, arranged in dense, compact clusters. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. This variety is notable for its aromatic foliage and its role in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
