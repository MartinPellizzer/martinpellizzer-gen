    "intro": "Jasione cartilaginea, commonly known as the cartilaginous bellflower, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy, fleshy leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Jasione cartilaginea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
