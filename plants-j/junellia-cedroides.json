It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in Georgia and Florida, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves that resemble those of cedars, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Its flowers are typically small and clustered in racemes, producing a subtle fragrance. Junellia cedroides is often found in shaded to partially shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in forest understories."
