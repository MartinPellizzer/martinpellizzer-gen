    "intro": "Jacobaea gigantea, commonly known as the giant ragwort, is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its large, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. The plant typically grows to heights of up to 2 meters, featuring deeply lobed, hairy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands. However, it is considered invasive in some regions and can be toxic to livestock."
