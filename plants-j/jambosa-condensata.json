    "intro": "Jambosa condensata, commonly known as the African blackwood, is a small evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood and has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red berries containing one or two seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland and savanna habitats. Due to its slow growth and valuable timber, it is considered a threatened species in some regions."
