    "intro": "Jasione montana subsp. stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers. The plant spreads via stolons, which are horizontal stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a common sight in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil make it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
