    "intro": "Junia, commonly known as the common juniper, is a shrub belonging to the Cupressaceae family. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, round berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for various wildlife species. Junia is often found in rocky or well-drained soils in temperate regions. Its aromatic wood has been historically used in the production of gin and other spirits."
