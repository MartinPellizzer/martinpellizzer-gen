    "intro": "Jurinea trifurcata, commonly known as the three-branched sandflower, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with narrow, linear leaves adapted to withstand harsh, saline conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access water in dry soils. Jurinea trifurcata plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in dunes and coastal habitats."
