    "intro": "Jasminum sambac var. duplex, commonly known as the double-flowered jasmine, is a variant of the common jasmine plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, double blooms that are more densely packed than those of the standard variety. The plant typically grows as a shrub or vine, featuring opposite, oval-shaped leaves and yellowish-green stems. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. This variety is widely cultivated for ornamental purposes and in perfumery due to its intense floral scent."
