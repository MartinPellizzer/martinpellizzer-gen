    "intro": "Jamesonia erecta, commonly known as the upright jamesonia, is a perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. The plant features small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring, typically in shades of white or pale pink. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense groundcovers, making it suitable for erosion control in shaded areas. Jamesonia erecta prefers moist, acidic soils and partial to full shade, thriving in woodland environments."
