    "intro": "Justicia angustibracteata, commonly known as the narrow bract justicia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, often reaching heights of up to 1 meter. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their shape and nectar-rich structure."
