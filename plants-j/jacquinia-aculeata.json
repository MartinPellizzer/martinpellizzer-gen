    "intro": "Jacquinia aculeata, commonly known as the prickly everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale blue ray florets, which bloom in late summer to early fall. Jacquinia aculeata is often found in dry, rocky habitats and has a sprawling growth habit with hairy, sometimes spiny stems. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
