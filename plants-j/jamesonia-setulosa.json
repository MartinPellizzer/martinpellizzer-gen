    "intro": "Jamesonia setulosa, commonly known as the woolly saxifrage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant has hairy, silver-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its botanical characteristics make it well-adapted to cold, high-altitude conditions."
