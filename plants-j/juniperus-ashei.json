    "intro": "Juniperus ashei, commonly known as the Ashe juniper, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage and small, berry-like cones that mature to a dark blue color. This plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in woodland and chaparral habitats. Ashe juniper can reach heights of up to 30 feet and has a slow growth rate, making it a long-lived species. Its presence is significant in the ecology of the region, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
