    "intro": "Jurinea korolkowi, commonly known as the Korolkov's sandflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to extreme temperatures and limited rainfall. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is often found in steppe and desert ecosystems."
