It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to those of the common jambosa. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soils and full sun.
