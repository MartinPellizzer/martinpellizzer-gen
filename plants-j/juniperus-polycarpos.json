    "intro": "Juniperus polycarpos, commonly known as the red juniper, is a species of coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its scale-like leaves that are typically reddish-brown in color, giving the plant its common name. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for various birds and animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Juniperus polycarpos is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional medicine."
