    "intro": "Justicia atacta, commonly known as the red-stemmed false arum, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking, spadix-like inflorescence surrounded by a brightly colored spathe, which resembles a flower. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and features lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female parts, and are pollinated by insects. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks."
