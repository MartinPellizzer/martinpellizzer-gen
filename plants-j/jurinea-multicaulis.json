    "intro": "Jurinea multicaulis, commonly known as the coastal sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the arid and coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant with small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the edges of salt marshes. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
