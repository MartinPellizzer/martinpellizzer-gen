    "intro": "Juncus parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flower rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It typically grows in dense clusters, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with slender, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland habitats. Juncus parviflorus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
