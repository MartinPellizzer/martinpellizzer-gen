    "intro": "Jasminum sarawacense, commonly known as the Sarawak jasmine, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often releasing a sweet scent during the night. The plant has opposite, simple leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a smooth texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing along forest floors or on rocky outcrops. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical studies."
