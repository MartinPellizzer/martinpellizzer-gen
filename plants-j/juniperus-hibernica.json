    "intro": "Juniperus hibernica, commonly known as the Irish juniper, is a small evergreen shrub native to the western coasts of Scotland and Ireland. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage and small, berry-like cones that mature to a dark blue color. The plant typically grows in coastal heathlands and is adapted to harsh, maritime climates. Its roots help stabilize sandy soils, making it an important species in coastal ecosystems. Juniperus hibernica is also valued for its aromatic wood and historical use in traditional medicine."
