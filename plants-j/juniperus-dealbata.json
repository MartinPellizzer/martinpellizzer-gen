    "intro": "Juniperus dealbata, commonly known as the white juniper, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its pale blue-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its slender, spreading form. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but often used in gin production. Juniperus dealbata thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant in Mediterranean climates. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
