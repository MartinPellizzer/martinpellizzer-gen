    "intro": "Juniperus pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf juniper, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are usually blue or black when mature. Juniperus pygmaea is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in rocky soils. It is widely cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its hardiness and attractive appearance."
