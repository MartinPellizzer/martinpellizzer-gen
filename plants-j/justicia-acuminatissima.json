    "intro": "Justicia acuminatissima, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flameflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, especially hummingbirds, due to their bright colors and nectar-rich structure. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
