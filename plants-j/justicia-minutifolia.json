It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of bright red, tubular flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. These flowers are pollinated primarily by hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers."
