    "intro": "Juncus leersii var. praeflorens, commonly known as the prairie rush, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes and wet meadows. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. The flowers are usually greenish or brownish and are adapted for wind pollination."
