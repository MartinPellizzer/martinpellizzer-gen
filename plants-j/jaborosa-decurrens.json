    "intro": "Jaborosa decurrens, commonly known as the Brazilian milkweed, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a natural defense mechanism against herbivores. Jaborosa decurrens is also a host plant for certain species of butterflies, including the monarch."
