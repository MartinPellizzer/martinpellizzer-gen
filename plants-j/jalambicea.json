    "intro": "Jalambicea, commonly known as the Philippine native tree, is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and legume pods. It is native to the Philippines and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The seeds, encased in hard pods, are dispersed by wind and animals, contributing to its natural distribution."
