    "intro": "Juncus lampocarpus var. corymbosus, commonly known as the coastal rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It thrives in moist, sandy soils along coastal dunes and tidal zones, where it plays a vital role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing erosion. The plant has cylindrical, grass-like stems that are often bright green to reddish in color, and it produces clusters of small, spike-like flowers in late summer. It is adapted to salt spray and fluctuating water levels, making it a hardy species in coastal environments. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various insects and birds."
