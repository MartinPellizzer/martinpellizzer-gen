    "intro": "Jasminum fluminense, commonly known as the Brazilian jasmine, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a vigorous shrub or vine that can grow up to several meters in length, with opposite, simple, and usually elliptic leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the axils of the leaves. It is characterized by its strong, sweet scent, which attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is often used in ornamental gardening due to its aesthetic appeal and aromatic properties."
