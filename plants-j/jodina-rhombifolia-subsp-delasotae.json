It is characterized by its rhomboid-shaped leaves and distinctive floral structure. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in montane forests. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, displaying a range of colors from white to pale pink. Due to habitat loss, this subspecies is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
