    "intro": "Jussiaea brachycarpa var. genuina, commonly known as the narrow-fruit jussiaea, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are opposite and elliptic, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. This variant is distinguished by its shorter, more compact fruits compared to other varieties within the species."
