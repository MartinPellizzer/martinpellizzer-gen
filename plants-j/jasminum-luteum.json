    "intro": "Jasminum luteum, commonly known as the yellow jessamine, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring woody stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, preceding the foliage. These flowers are fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Jasminum luteum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its aromatic properties."
