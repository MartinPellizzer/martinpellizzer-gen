    "intro": "Jarava ibarii, commonly known as the Ibari grass, is a perennial grass native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in rocky, coastal environments and is adapted to the arid and saline conditions of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
