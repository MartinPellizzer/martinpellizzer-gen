    "intro": "Jenmaniella, commonly known as the narrow-leafed fern, is a species of aquatic fern found in freshwater environments. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in shaded, still waters and is often found in wetlands and along the edges of ponds. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Jenmaniella plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration."
