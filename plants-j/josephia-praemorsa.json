    "intro": "Josephia praemorsa, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its striking, pale blue or white flowers that bloom at night. The plant is notable for its unique morphology, featuring tubular flowers that open only under specific environmental conditions. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, Josephia praemorsa is considered a rare and poorly understood species in botanical studies."
