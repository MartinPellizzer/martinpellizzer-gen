    "intro": "Juniperus communis var. arborescens, commonly known as the creeping juniper, is a low-growing evergreen shrub or small tree native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, arranged in whorls along the stems. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value. This variety is distinguished by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions."
