    "intro": "Jarava malalhuensis, commonly known as the Malalhuense grass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in shrublands and rocky soils, exhibiting a low-growing, clump-forming habit. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient component of its ecosystem. Its presence often indicates well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils in its natural habitat."
