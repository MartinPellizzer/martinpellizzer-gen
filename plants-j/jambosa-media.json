    "intro": "Jambosa media, commonly known as the Brazilian pear, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is a small tree that can grow up to 8 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by yellow, pear-shaped fruits. The fruit has a sweet, juicy pulp with a mild, aromatic flavor, and it is often consumed fresh or used in jams and juices. Jambosa media thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
