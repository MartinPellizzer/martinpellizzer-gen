    "intro": "Juncus glaucus longicornis, commonly known as the long-beaked rush, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of North America. It belongs to the Juncaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often in marshes, swamps, or along the edges of ponds. Its flowers are usually pale green to white, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Juncus glaucus longicornis plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
