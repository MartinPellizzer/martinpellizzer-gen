    "intro": "Juniperus deppeana f. sperryi, commonly known as Sperry's juniper, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to specific regions of the southwestern United States. It is a small evergreen shrub or tree characterized by its scale-like leaves and berry-like cones. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert landscapes. Its botanical features include aromatic foliage and small, dark blue berries that are typically retained on the plant for extended periods. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
