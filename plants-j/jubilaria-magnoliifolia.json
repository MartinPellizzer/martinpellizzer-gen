It is characterized by its large, showy, white to cream-colored flowers that resemble those of magnolia trees, hence its common name. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or wetland habitats. Jubilaria magnoliifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
