It is native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, particularly in the Alps and Carpathians. The plant is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, scale-like leaves arranged in compact clusters. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by fleshy, berry-like cones that are typically red or blue in color. Juno victoris is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils."
