    "intro": "Jambosa trifida, commonly known as the three-lobed jambosa, is a tropical shrub native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a triangular pattern. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible berries that are similar in appearance to guavas. Its fruit is valued for its sweet, juicy flesh and is often consumed fresh or used in culinary applications. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in forested areas or along riverbanks."
