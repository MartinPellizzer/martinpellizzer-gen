    "intro": "Juniperus pseudosabina var. turkestanica, commonly known as the Turkestan juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and mountainous regions. This variety is notable for its resilience to harsh climatic conditions and its ornamental value in landscaping."
