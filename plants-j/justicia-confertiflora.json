    "intro": "Justicia confertiflora, commonly known as the clustered flame flower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that resemble clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with a fine pubescence. The flowers are primarily pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their bright colors and nectar-rich structure."
