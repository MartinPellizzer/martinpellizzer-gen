    "intro": "Juncus cephalotes var. minimus, commonly known as the dwarf rush, is a compact, herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It features slender, cylindrical stems that are typically less than 30 centimeters in height, adapted for waterlogged soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming dense mats that help stabilize soil. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
