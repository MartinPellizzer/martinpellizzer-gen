It features striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with a contrasting white or yellow throat. The plant has slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This plant is popular in gardens for its vibrant blooms and ability to attract hummingbirds and other pollinators."
