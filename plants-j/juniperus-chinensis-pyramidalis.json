    "intro": "Juniperus chinensis pyramidalis, commonly known as the Chinese juniper or pyramidale, is a shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its narrow, pyramid-shaped growth habit and dense, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. Juniperus chinensis pyramidalis is also valued for its hardiness and ability to tolerate urban environments."
