It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its palmate leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant is often found in wetlands and disturbed soils, where it thrives in moist, sunny environments. Its fibrous roots and rapid growth make it a common weed in agricultural areas.
