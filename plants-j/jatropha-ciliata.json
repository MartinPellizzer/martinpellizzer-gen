    "intro": "Jatropha ciliata, commonly known as the silky jatropha, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 3 meters in height, featuring smooth, grayish bark and alternate, ovate leaves with hairy margins. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing toxic, orange-red seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is not suitable for human consumption but is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
