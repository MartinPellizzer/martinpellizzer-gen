It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers, which are usually pink or purple, attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
