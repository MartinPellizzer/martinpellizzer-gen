    "intro": "Jacobaea erucifolia subsp. erucifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features basal rosettes of linear, often hairy leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its scientific name reflects its historical association with the genus *Hieracium*, which includes various hawkweed species."
