    "intro": "Juncus articulatus subsp. lampocarpus, commonly known as the slender rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems that are often jointed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear greenish-white flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist soils. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
