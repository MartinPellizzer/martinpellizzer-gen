    "intro": "Juncus acutus var. multibracteatus, commonly known as the many-bract rush, is a variant of the slender rush species native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that often reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which are covered in numerous bracts, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically arranged in dense tufts at the base of the plant. This species is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife."
