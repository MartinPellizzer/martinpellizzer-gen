    "intro": "Jussiaea longifolia var. vulgaris, commonly known as the common water primrose, is a semi-aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, with its prostrate stems spreading across the surface. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are broad and floating, often forming a dense mat on the water's surface. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
