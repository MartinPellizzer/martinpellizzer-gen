    "intro": "Justicia lanceolaria, commonly known as the flame flower, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It features showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with a contrasting throat. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their shape and nectar-rich structure."
