The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color and bear small, spike-like clusters of greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are grass-like, narrow, and pointed, growing in dense tufts at the base. This species plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various insects and birds."
