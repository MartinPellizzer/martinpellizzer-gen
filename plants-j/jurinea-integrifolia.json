    "intro": "Jurinea integrifolia, commonly known as the coastal buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of western North America. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Jurinea integrifolia plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
