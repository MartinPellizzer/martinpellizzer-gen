    "intro": "Jacobaea ambigua, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ragwort, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough, hairy texture, while its yellow flowers bloom from late summer to early autumn. Jacobaea ambigua is also known for its toxic properties, containing pyrrolizidine alkaloids that can be harmful to livestock and humans if ingested."
