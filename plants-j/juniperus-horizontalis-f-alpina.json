    "intro": "Juniperus horizontalis f. alpina, commonly known as the alpine juniper, is a low-growing shrub native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and blue-green foliage that remains throughout the year. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are typically dark blue when mature. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is highly tolerant of cold and dry conditions. Juniperus horizontalis f. alpina is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
