    "intro": "Jurinea polycephala, commonly known as the coastal bladder campion, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of western Europe. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes and rocky shores. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers with five petals, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. Jurinea polycephala is well-suited to coastal conditions due to its salt tolerance and ability to withstand strong winds."
