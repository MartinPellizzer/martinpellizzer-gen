    "intro": "Juncus glaucus aggregatus, commonly known as the blue rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in moist to waterlogged soils and is often found in marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late spring to early summer, produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated. Juncus glaucus aggregatus plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
