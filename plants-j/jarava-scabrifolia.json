    "intro": "Jarava scabrifolia, commonly known as the roughleaf jarava, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and open plains. The plant has narrow, linear leaves with a rough, sandpaper-like texture, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. Its inflorescence consists of dense clusters of spikelets, which are often reddish or brownish in color. Jarava scabrifolia plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small animals and insects in its native range."
