    "intro": "Juncus inflexus var. paniculatus, commonly known as the panicled rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its cylindrical, grass-like stems that grow in dense clusters, typically reaching heights of 1 to 3 meters. The plant produces panicles of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate floral display. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-green hue, and are arranged spirally along the stem. This variety is adapted to moist or wet soils and plays a role in stabilizing shoreline ecosystems."
