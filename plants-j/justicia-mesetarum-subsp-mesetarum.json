    "intro": "Justicia mesetarum subsp. mesetarum, commonly known as the Meseta justicia, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its erect stems and clusters of tubular flowers. The plant produces showy, two-lipped flowers in shades of pink to purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance."
