    "intro": "Juncus \u00d7 oronensis, commonly known as the hybrid rush, is a perennial plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Juncus balticus and Juncus roemerianus, two native rush species. The plant typically grows in brackish or freshwater marshes, often forming dense stands that stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife. Its cylindrical, grass-like leaves are usually green or reddish in color, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer. Juncus \u00d7 oronensis plays an important ecological role in coastal and wetland ecosystems by filtering water and supporting biodiversity."
