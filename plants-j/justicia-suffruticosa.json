    "intro": "Justicia suffruticosa, commonly known as red-hot poker or torch flower, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring upright, branching stems covered in rough, hairy foliage. The plant is characterized by its showy, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom in dense clusters at the ends of the stems, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly waxy texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in well-drained soils. Justicia suffruticosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
