    "intro": "Jacobaea nivea, commonly known as the white ragwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its composite flower heads. Jacobaea nivea is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky soils. It has been historically used in traditional medicine but is now considered a potential weed in some regions."
