    "intro": "Jatropha divergens, commonly known as the spreading jatropha, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy and have a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers that eventually develop into bright red, three-lobed berries. The seeds within the berries are encased in a fleshy, orange aril, which is a characteristic feature of the genus Jatropha. It is notable for its ornamental value and has been studied for potential use in biofuel production."
