    "intro": "Juniperus brevifolia, commonly known as the dwarf juniper, is a small evergreen shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with dense, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. Juniperus brevifolia is well adapted to harsh conditions, thriving in poor soils and requiring minimal water once established. It is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value."
