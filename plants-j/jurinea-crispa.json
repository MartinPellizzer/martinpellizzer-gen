    "intro": "Jurinea crispa, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to maritime climates. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Jurinea crispa is often found in dunes and coastal grasslands, where it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
