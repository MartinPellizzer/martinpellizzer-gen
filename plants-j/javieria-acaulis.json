    "intro": "Javieria acaulis, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the rocky habitats of North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has no true stems, with leaves forming a basal rosette and flowers emerging directly from the leaf axils. It thrives in well-drained, gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh, cold climates with limited soil nutrients."
