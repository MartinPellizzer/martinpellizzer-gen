    "intro": "Jurinea platylepis, commonly known as the broad-leaved sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or rocky soils, often found in dune environments. The plant features narrow, silver-gray leaves and produces small, blue or violet flowers in late spring. It is adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a hardy species in harsh coastal conditions. Jurinea platylepis plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
