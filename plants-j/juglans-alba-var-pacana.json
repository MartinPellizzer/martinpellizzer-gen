    "intro": "Juglans alba var. pacana, commonly known as the Mexican walnut, is a variant of the white walnut native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, featuring compound leaves with 15 to 23 leaflets. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by round, green fruits that mature into brown, woody nuts. The nuts are encased in a thick, spiky husk and are edible after the husk is removed. This species is valued for its hard, durable wood and its potential use in traditional medicine."
