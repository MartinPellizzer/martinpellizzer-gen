    "intro": "Justicia macrantha var. piliformis, commonly known as the narrowleaf flame flower, is a striking tropical plant native to parts of Central America and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its vibrant red to orange tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting hummingbirds and other pollinators. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture, and the plant typically grows as an upright shrub or small tree. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and as a container plant."
