    "intro": "Jatropha coerulescens, commonly known as the blue jatropha, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a vibrant touch to its natural habitat. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and it produces small, toxic seeds that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. However, due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
