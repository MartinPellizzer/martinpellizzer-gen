    "intro": "Justicia lilloi, commonly known as desert willow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features slender, willow-like branches and produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps reduce water loss. Justicia lilloi is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
