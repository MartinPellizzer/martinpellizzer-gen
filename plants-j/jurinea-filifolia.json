    "intro": "Jurinea filifolia, commonly known as the sea holly, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and striking blue or purple flower heads that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize dunes and prevent erosion. Jurinea filifolia is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
