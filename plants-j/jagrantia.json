    "intro": "Jagrantia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with prominent stamens, which are often followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Jagrantia is native to Central and South America but has been introduced to other tropical regions. It is often considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
