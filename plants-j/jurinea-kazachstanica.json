    "intro": "Jurinea kazachstanica, commonly known as the Kazakh sandflower, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia, particularly Kazakhstan. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are usually covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Jurinea kazachstanica is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in dunes and grassland habitats."
