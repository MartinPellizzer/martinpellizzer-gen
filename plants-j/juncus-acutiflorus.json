It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of white or greenish flowers. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water. Juncus acutiflorus is also a valuable food source for various wildlife species."
