    "intro": "Jatropha diversifolia var. pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered jewelweed, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The flowers are small, yellow-orange, and clustered in cymes, often with a distinctive red calyx. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain toxic seeds, a trait shared with other members of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests."
