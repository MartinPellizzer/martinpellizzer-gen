    "intro": "Juncus monticola, commonly known as mountain rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It typically grows in moist, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikes of small, greenish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including cold temperatures and strong winds. Juncus monticola plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
