    "intro": "Juncus tenuis var. williamsii, commonly known as the slender rush, is a variety of the slender rush plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its botanical features include fibrous roots, linear leaves, and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
