    "intro": "Jaltomata lanata, commonly known as the hairy jaltomata, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, tubular flowers that typically range in color from purple to red. The plant belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes and potatoes, and is often found in high-altitude grasslands. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that contain seeds. Jaltomata lanata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
