    "intro": "Juniperus japonica var. variegata, commonly known as the Variegated Japanese Juniper, is a compact evergreen shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its slow growth rate and distinctive foliage, which features variegated leaves with white or yellow margins. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are typically ornamental rather than edible. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and bonsai cultivation. Its unique appearance and hardiness make it a valuable addition to horticultural collections."
