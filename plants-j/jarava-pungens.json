    "intro": "Jarava pungens, commonly known as the spiked jarava, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and open grasslands. The plant has slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its flowering heads are small and spike-like, producing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Jarava pungens plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
