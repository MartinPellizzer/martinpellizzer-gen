    "intro": "Juncus supinus var. aquatilis, commonly known as the water rush, is a variant of the common rush that thrives in wetland environments. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its cylindrical, grass-like stems that grow in dense clusters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often submerged or floating at the water's surface. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
