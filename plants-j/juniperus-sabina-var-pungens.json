It is characterized by its dense, low-growing form and needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, scale-like leaves and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in rocky or well-drained soils. It is also known for its aromatic foliage and small, berry-like cones that mature to a dark blue color. This variety is particularly hardy and adaptable, making it suitable for a range of garden environments."
