    "intro": "Justicia royeniana, commonly known as the red flame plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular red flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, especially hummingbirds, due to their bright color and nectar-rich structure. Justicia royeniana is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
