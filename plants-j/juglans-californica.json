    "intro": "Juglans californica, commonly known as the California black walnut, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It belongs to the walnut family, Juglandaceae, and is characterized by its dark, ridged bark and large, doubly serrated leaves. The tree produces green, spherical fruits that mature into brown, inedible nuts enclosed in a spiky husk. Its wood is highly valued for its strength and rich, aromatic grain, making it a prized material in woodworking. The plant also plays an important ecological role by providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
