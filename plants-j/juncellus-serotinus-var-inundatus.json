It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in saturated soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. Its adaptability to waterlogged conditions makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
