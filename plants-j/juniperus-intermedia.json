    "intro": "Juniperus intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate juniper, is a species of coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, providing a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for various birds and mammals. Juniperus intermedia thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its hardy nature makes it a resilient plant in harsh, cold climates."
