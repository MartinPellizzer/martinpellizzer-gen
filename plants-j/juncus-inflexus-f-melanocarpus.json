    "intro": "Juncus inflexus f. melanocarpus, commonly known as the black-fruited rush, is a variant of the common rush species native to wetland habitats. It is characterized by its dark, almost black berries, which distinguish it from other forms of Juncus inflexus. The plant typically grows in moist to aquatic environments, such as marshes and pond edges. Its slender, grass-like leaves are arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife."
