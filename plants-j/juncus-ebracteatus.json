    "intro": "Juncus ebracteatus, commonly known as the slender rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It features tall, narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes, often emerging from the base of the foliage. Its root system helps stabilize soil and improve water filtration in wetland ecosystems. Juncus ebracteatus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in moist conditions."
