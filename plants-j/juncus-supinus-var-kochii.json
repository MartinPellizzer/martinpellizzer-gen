It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of white or pale green flowers. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and is often found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. This variant is distinguished from other juncus species by its specific morphological traits and geographic distribution."
