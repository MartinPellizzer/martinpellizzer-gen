    "intro": "Jurinea angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf sea-blite, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dunes and rocky shores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Jurinea angustifolia plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
