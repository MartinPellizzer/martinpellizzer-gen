    "intro": "Jussiaea neglecta, commonly known as the swamp milkweed, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas in North America. It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom in the summer months. Jussiaea neglecta thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
