    "intro": "Jussiaea pilosa var. glabra, commonly known as smooth water-mallow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It features alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are smooth and often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted for waterlogged soils, making it a common species in marshes and along the edges of ponds. This variety is distinguished from the typical Jussiaea pilosa by its glabrous (hairless) foliage."
