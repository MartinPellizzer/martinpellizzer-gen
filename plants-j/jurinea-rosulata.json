    "intro": "Jurinea rosulata, commonly known as the rosette sandflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves and ability to survive in sandy soils make it well adapted to drought conditions. Jurinea rosulata is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
