    "intro": "Jaramilloa sanctae-martae, commonly known as the Santa Marta jaramilloa, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Colombia. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers with prominent yellow stamens. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are elliptical and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, it is considered an endangered species."
