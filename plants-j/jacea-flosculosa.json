    "intro": "Jacea flosculosa, commonly known as the small-flowered jacea, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cooler, temperate climates. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Jacea flosculosa is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations."
