    "intro": "Justicia clinopodium, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a perennial herb that grows up to 3 feet tall, featuring slender, branching stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its ornamental value comes from its striking floral display and ability to attract pollinators like butterflies and bees."
