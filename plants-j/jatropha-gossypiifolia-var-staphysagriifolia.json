    "intro": "Jatropha gossypiifolia var. staphysagriifolia, commonly known as the flame flower or staghorn jatropha, is a striking ornamental plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its vibrant, flame-like red or orange bracts that surround its small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain toxic, black seeds, which are a defense mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes in tropical and subtropical areas."
