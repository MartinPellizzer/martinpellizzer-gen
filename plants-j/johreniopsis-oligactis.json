    "intro": "Johreniopsis oligactis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved coryphostemon, is a rare and unique plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the trunks of trees in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Johreniopsis oligactis is considered a species of conservation concern."
