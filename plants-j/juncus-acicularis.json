    "intro": "Juncus acicularis, commonly known as the needle rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically bright green and can grow up to several feet in height. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of pale brown flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. Juncus acicularis plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wetland organisms."
