    "intro": "Juniperus macrocarpa var. lobelii, commonly known as the Lobel\u2019s juniper, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features dense, dark green foliage with a pyramidal shape, and its leaves are scale-like, measuring about 1\u20132 mm in length. The plant produces small, spherical blue-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant for garden use. This variety is distinguished by its compact growth habit and unique foliage compared to other juniper species."
