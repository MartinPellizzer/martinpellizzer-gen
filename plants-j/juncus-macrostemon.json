    "intro": "Juncus macrostemon, commonly known as the broad-leaved rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often clustered together, and its leaves are long, flat, and grass-like. Its small, greenish flowers are arranged in dense spikes and are often wind-pollinated. Juncus macrostemon plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
