    "intro": "Jacea elatior, commonly known as the tall jacea, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Jacea elatior is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable climates."
