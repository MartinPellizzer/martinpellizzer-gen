    "intro": "Jatropha albomaculata, commonly known as the white-spotted physic nut, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that are often adorned with white spots, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow fruits that contain toxic seeds, which are not suitable for human consumption. Jatropha albomaculata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and wastelands. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners in warm climates."
