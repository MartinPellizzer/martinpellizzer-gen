    "intro": "Jasminum leptophyllum, commonly known as the slender jasmine, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. The plant is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in coastal environments with high salinity. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value. Its aromatic flowers make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a low-maintenance, fragrant plant."
