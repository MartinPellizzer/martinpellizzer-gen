    "intro": "Jurinea cadmea subsp. cadmea, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its distinctive blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it reflect sunlight and conserve water. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to saline and windy environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, facilitating its spread along coastal areas. Jurinea cadmea subsp. cadmea is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
