    "intro": "Juncus ramboi, commonly known as the ramboi rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa. It typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are usually unbranched and covered in a layer of fine, scale-like leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered in spike-like inflorescences, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Juncus ramboi plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
