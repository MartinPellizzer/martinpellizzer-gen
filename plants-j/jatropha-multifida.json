    "intro": "Jatropha multifida, commonly known as the spurred nightshade, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive spurred leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, green, fleshy fruits that contain toxic seeds, making it potentially harmful to animals and humans. Jatropha multifida is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural studies."
