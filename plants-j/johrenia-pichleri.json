It is native to the mountainous regions of Central America, particularly in Guatemala and Honduras. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
