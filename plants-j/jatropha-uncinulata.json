    "intro": "Jatropha uncinulata, commonly known as the hooked spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its milky sap and showy, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, with simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open woodlands or along roadsides. Jatropha uncinulata is also noted for its potential in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals from the soil."
