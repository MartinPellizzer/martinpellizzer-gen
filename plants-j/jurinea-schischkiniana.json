It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in saline and arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically silver-gray, covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Jurinea schischkiniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
