It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves and showy pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. The tree produces small, sweet, and aromatic fruits similar to apples but with a more delicate flavor. Juno persica is often cultivated for both its ornamental value and edible fruit. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for temperate climates."
