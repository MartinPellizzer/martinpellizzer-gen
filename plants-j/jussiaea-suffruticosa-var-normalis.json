    "intro": "Jussiaea suffruticosa var. normalis, commonly known as the swamp willow or water willow, is a shrub-like plant native to wetland environments in South America. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems that grow close to the ground, and its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found along rivers, lakes, and in marshy areas. Its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions makes it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems."
