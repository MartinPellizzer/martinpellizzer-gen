    "intro": "Jatropha rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf physic nut, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its rounded, waxy leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, greenish-black berries that contain toxic seeds, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for agricultural purposes."
