    "intro": "Juncus brevistilus, commonly known as the short-stemmed rush, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated. It has a dense, fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil in wetland habitats. Juncus brevistilus plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
