    "intro": "Jacobaea sylvatica, commonly known as the woodland fleabane, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. Its scientific name reflects its association with forested habitats, and it is often found in temperate regions. Jacobaea sylvatica is valued for its ornamental appeal and has historical uses in traditional medicine."
