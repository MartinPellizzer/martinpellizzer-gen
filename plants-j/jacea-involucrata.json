    "intro": "Jacea involucrata, commonly known as the hooded jacea, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Jacea involucrata is considered a rare and endangered species."
