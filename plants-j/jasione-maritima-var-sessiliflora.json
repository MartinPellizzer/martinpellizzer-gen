It is characterized by its small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, adapting to saline and windy conditions. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly hairy texture. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
