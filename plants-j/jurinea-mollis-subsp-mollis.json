    "intro": "Jurinea mollis subsp. mollis, commonly known as the soft sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy leaves that are adapted to retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are usually covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is well-suited for xerophytic gardens and can thrive in sandy or gravelly soils."
