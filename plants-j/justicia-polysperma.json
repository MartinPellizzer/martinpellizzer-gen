    "intro": "Justicia polysperma, commonly known as the red mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, often arranged in terminal panicles. These flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, especially hummingbirds, due to their shape and nectar-rich structure. The plant is also notable for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its use in ornamental gardening."
