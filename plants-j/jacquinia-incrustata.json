    "intro": "Jacquinia incrustata, commonly known as the rock spirea, is a low-growing shrub native to the western United States. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, erect stalks. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or arid environments. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and visual interest."
