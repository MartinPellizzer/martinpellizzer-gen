    "intro": "Juncus stygius subsp. stygius, commonly known as the black rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of greenish-white flowers. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions and its role in stabilizing wetland soils. The subspecies is closely related to other members of the Juncaceae family, sharing similar morphological traits and ecological preferences."
