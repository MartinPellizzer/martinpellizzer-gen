    "intro": "Jagrantia monstrum, commonly known as the Shadow Bloom, is a rare and striking plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes. It features large, velvety leaves that range in color from deep indigo to dark emerald, often with intricate patterns resembling ancient symbols. The plant produces bioluminescent flowers that emit a soft blue glow at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its roots are known to secrete a sticky substance that helps retain moisture in its arid environment. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is highly valued in both botanical research and traditional medicine."
