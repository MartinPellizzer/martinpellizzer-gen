    "intro": "Jatropha maracayensis, commonly known as the Maracayensis physic nut, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red berries containing toxic seeds. It is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and is sometimes cultivated for its potential in biofuel production. However, its milky latex and toxic seeds make it a plant that requires caution when handling."
