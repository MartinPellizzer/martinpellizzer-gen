    "intro": "Juniperus communis var. caucasica, commonly known as the Caucasian juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color and arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
