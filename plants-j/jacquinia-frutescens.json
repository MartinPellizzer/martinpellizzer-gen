It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage. The plant has small, showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline and is adapted to salt spray and coastal conditions. Jacquinia frutescens plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
