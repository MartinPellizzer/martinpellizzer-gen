    "intro": "Juncus lampocarpus var. stolonifer, commonly known as the creeping rush, is a perennial plant native to coastal areas of the Pacific Northwest. It forms dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear brownish to reddish flowers. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in dune environments. Its stoloniferous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming extensive mats that stabilize sand dunes."
