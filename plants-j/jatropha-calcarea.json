    "intro": "Jatropha calcarea, commonly known as the chalky spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, followed by orange-red berries containing toxic seeds. Jatropha calcarea is adapted to thrive in poor, calcareous soils, which is reflected in its common name. It is often found in rocky or sandy habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small wildlife."
