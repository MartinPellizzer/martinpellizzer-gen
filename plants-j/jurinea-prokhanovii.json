    "intro": "Jurinea prokhanovii, commonly known as the Prokhanov's sea rocket, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Arctic and subarctic. It is a low-growing, herbaceous species that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in maritime environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are typically narrow and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in harsh, windy conditions. Jurinea prokhanovii plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and is an indicator species for saline and coastal habitats."
