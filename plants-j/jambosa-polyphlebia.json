    "intro": "Jambosa polyphlebia, commonly known as the red-veined jambosa, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its unique latex-producing properties. The plant features large, palmate leaves with striking red veins, which give it its common name. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically green or yellow, and it produces edible fruits that are somewhat similar to those of the native jambosa. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has some traditional medicinal uses in local communities."
