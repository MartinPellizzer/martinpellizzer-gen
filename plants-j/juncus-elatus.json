    "intro": "Juncus elatus, commonly known as the tall rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically growing in a basal rosette. Juncus elatus thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks."
