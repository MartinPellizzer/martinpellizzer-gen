    "intro": "Juniperus humilis, commonly known as the low juniper or creeping juniper, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features scale-like leaves that are tightly pressed against the stems, giving it a dense appearance. Its small, blue-gray berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Juniperus humilis is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
