It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of bright red or orange tubular flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden landscapes and container planting."
