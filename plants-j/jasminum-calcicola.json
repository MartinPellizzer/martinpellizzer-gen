    "intro": "Jasminum calcicola, commonly known as the limestone jasmine, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils, which is reflected in its common name. Its foliage consists of narrow, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Jasminum calcicola is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
