    "intro": "Jussiaea repens var. uruguayensis, commonly known as the Uruguay sandplant, is a low-growing, perennial herb native to the arid regions of South America. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited water availability. The plant features small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss through transpiration. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. This variant is closely related to other species in the genus Jussiaea, which are often used in ecological restoration projects due to their resilience."
