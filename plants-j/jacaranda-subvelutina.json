    "intro": "Jacaranda subvelutina, commonly known as the velvet jacaranda, is a species of flowering tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in pendulous clusters during the summer months. The tree has smooth, greyish bark and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The seeds are encased in a woody pod and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural spread."
