    "intro": "Jatropha hernandiifolia var. epeltata, commonly known as the red-veined jatropha, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking foliage, with leaves that have deep red veins contrasting against dark green backgrounds. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into toxic, orange-red berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though care must be taken due to its toxic properties."
