    "intro": "Juniperus caucasica, commonly known as Caucasian juniper, is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caucasus region. It typically grows in mountainous areas and has a slow growth rate, often forming dense thickets. The plant features scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and whitish underneath, with small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine. The plant's resilience to harsh climates makes it an important component of its native ecosystems."
