    "intro": "Jamesonia paleacea, commonly known as the white-flowered bellbush, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in partial to full shade, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens. Its leaves are elliptical and dark green, while its flowers, which bloom in late spring, are pale white with a slight pink hue. Jamesonia paleacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
