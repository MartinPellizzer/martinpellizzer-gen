    "intro": "Jacea scabiosa, commonly known as the common mullein, is a biennial plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, velvety leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to greenish flowers in late summer, which are followed by fluffy, seed-filled capsules. Jacea scabiosa thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in meadows. It has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties, particularly for respiratory ailments."
