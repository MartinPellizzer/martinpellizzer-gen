    "intro": "Jussiaea onagra, commonly known as the yellow water-lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to South America. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. The plant features floating leaves with a waxy surface and bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the mud and absorbing nutrients from the water. Jussiaea onagra plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
