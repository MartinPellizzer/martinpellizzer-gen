    "intro": "Jacobaea viscosa, commonly known as common tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a robust, branched stem that is often hairy and can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces small, yellow, daisy-like flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, which bloom from late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are deeply lobed, aromatic, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Jacobaea viscosa is known for its strong scent and has been used historically for its medicinal and pesticidal properties."
