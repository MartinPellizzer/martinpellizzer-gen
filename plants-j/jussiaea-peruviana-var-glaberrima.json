    "intro": "Jussiaea peruviana var. glaberrima, commonly known as the Peruvian water willow, is a semi-aquatic plant native to South America. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of slow-moving water bodies. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Its root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic habitats. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal in water gardens."
