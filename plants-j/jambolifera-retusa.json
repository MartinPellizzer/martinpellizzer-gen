It is a large, evergreen tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, with a broad, umbrella-like canopy. The plant produces small, green flowers that develop into edible, sweet fruits resembling dates. Its leaves are long and pinnately compound, providing shade and contributing to the plant's ornamental value. The tree is well adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, making it an important crop in regions with limited water resources."
