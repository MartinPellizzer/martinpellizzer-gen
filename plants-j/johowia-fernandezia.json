    "intro": "Johowia fernandezia, commonly known as the Fernandezia fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically green with a subtle silvery sheen. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Johowia fernandezia is considered a vulnerable species."
