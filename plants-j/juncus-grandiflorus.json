    "intro": "Juncus grandiflorus, commonly known as the broadleaf rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features tall, cylindrical stems that are often reddish or purplish in color, growing up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers at the top of the stems, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a slightly waxy coating. Juncus grandiflorus plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
