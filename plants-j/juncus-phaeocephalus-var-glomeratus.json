    "intro": "Juncus phaeocephalus var. glomeratus, commonly known as the black-headed rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It features tall, cylindrical stems that are typically dark green to brown in color, often with a reddish tinge. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences at the top of the stems, which are usually reddish-brown to black in hue. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and arranged in a compact rosette at the base. This variety is often found in marshes, pond edges, and other moist habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
