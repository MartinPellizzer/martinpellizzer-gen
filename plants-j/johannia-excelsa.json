    "intro": "Johannia excelsa, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, round, floating leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter. The plant has a thick, waxy leaf surface that helps it remain buoyant and resist water damage. Its flowers are typically white or pink, with a distinctive, showy appearance that attracts pollinators. Johannia excelsa plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic life and contributing to water quality regulation."
