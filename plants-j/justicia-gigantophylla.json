    "intro": "Justicia gigantophylla, commonly known as the giant leaf justicia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of showy, tubular flowers in shades of pink and red, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
