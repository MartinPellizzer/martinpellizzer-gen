    "intro": "Juncus umbellifer, commonly known as the umbrella rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It features tall, cylindrical stems that often grow in dense clusters, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in an umbel-like cluster at the top of the stem. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a slight sheen. Juncus umbellifer plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
