It features tall, cylindrical stems that are often reddish or brownish in color, covered with small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of tiny, spike-like flowers that are typically green or brown, depending on the species. It thrives in moist to waterlogged soils and is often found in temperate regions. Juncus equisetosus plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
