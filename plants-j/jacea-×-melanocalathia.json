    "intro": "Jacea \u00d7 melanocalathia, commonly known as the black-leafed bellflower, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Jacea indica and Jacea melonifera. It is characterized by its striking dark green to almost black leaves, which contrast with its pale blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland areas or along stream banks. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available."
