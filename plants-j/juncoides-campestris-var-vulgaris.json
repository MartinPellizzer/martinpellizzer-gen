It typically grows in moist to wet environments such as marshes, ditches, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikes, with three stamens and a single pistil. This species is known for its adaptability and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
