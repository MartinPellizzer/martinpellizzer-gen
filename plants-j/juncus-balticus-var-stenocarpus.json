    "intro": "Juncus balticus var. stenocarpus, commonly known as the narrow-carpel rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, wet meadows, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces spike-like inflorescences bearing small, three-lobed flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in suitable environments. The botanical characteristics of this variety make it an important species for wetland ecosystems and ecological restoration projects."
