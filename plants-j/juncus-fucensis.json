    "intro": "Juncus fucensis, commonly known as the black rush, is a perennial plant native to coastal areas of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dark, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in saline or brackish wetlands, where it thrives in muddy or sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters near the base of the stems. Juncus fucensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
