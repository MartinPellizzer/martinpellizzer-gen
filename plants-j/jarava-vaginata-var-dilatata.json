    "intro": "Jarava vaginata var. dilatata, commonly known as the broad-leaved jarava, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive swollen base, and its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small flowers. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-angled, dry fruits. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for native wildlife."
