    "intro": "Jarava, commonly known as needlegrass, is a genus of grasses belonging to the family Poaceae. These plants are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. Jarava species are characterized by their narrow, needle-like leaves and compact growth habit. They often form dense stands that help prevent soil erosion. Some species are used in traditional medicine or as forage for livestock."
