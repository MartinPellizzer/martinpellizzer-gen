    "intro": "Juncus inflexus f. strictus, commonly known as the stiff rush, is a compact, upright perennial plant native to wetland environments. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and densely packed, giving it a dense, mat-like appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters near the base, which are often surrounded by bracts. It thrives in moist to waterlogged soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. This variety is noted for its compact growth habit, making it a useful plant for stabilizing soil in wetland restoration projects."
