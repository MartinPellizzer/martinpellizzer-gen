    "intro": "Jovibarba globifera subsp. hirta, commonly known as the hairy cushion plant, is a perennial succulent belonging to the family Crassulaceae. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosettes of fleshy, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the spring or early summer. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Its unique morphology and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
