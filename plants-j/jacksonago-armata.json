It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces a tall flower stalk that bears small, white flowers, which bloom in the spring. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its leaves and stems.
