    "intro": "Juncus leersii f. viridiflorus, commonly known as the green-flowered rush, is a variant of the common rush species native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and dense clusters of small, greenish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. Its foliage is often used in floral arrangements due to its ornamental appearance. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
