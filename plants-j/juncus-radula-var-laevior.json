    "intro": "Juncus radula var. laevior, commonly known as the smooth rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems that grow in dense clusters, often reaching heights of 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and cylindrical, with a smooth, waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wetland organisms."
