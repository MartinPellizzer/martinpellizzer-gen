    "intro": "Joniris tenax, commonly known as the hardy rock cress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention in harsh environments. Joniris tenax is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in alpine and subalpine habitats."
