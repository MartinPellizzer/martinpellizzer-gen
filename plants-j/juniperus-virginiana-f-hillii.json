    "intro": "Juniperus virginiana f. hillii, commonly known as the Hill's prickly juniper, is a rare and unique form of the eastern red cedar. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, blue-gray leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. This plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments, making it a hardy shrub or small tree. Its cones are usually small and berry-like, containing toxic seeds that are not suitable for human consumption. The Hill's prickly juniper is of interest to botanists due to its distinct morphology and limited geographic distribution."
