    "intro": "Jostia, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flower heads, which are surrounded by spiny, leaf-like bracts. The plant thrives in coastal environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils along shorelines. Jostia has small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators in its native habitats."
