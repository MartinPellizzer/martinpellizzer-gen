It is characterized by its hairy, branching stems and leaves that are usually oval to lance-shaped. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange or red berries containing toxic seeds. Jatropha maculata is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of light conditions. Its latex sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, making it important to handle with care."
