    "intro": "Justicia arenicola, commonly known as sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that thrives in well-drained soils, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Justicia arenicola is valued for its drought tolerance and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
