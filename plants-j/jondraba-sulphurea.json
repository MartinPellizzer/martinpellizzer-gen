    "intro": "Jondraba sulphurea, commonly known as the golden sandflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking yellow to orange inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The plant has a low-growing, mat-forming habit with narrow, linear leaves adapted to conserve water. Its flowers are tubular and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Jondraba sulphurea is well-suited to sandy and gravelly soils, making it a hardy plant in dry environments."
