It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its glandular-stipitate leaves and yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces berries that contain toxic seeds, a trait common among many jatropha species. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found near water bodies. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural studies."
