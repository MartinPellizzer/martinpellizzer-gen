    "intro": "Juncus maritimus var. atlanticus, commonly known as the Atlantic rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to coastal regions of the Atlantic coast. It typically grows in saline or brackish wetlands, tolerating high salt concentrations and fluctuating water levels. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often used for erosion control due to their dense growth habit. Its small, greenish flowers appear in spikes during the summer months. This variety is an important component of coastal ecosystems, providing habitat for various wildlife species."
