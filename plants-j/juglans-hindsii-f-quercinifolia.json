    "intro": "Juglans hindsii f. quercinifolia, commonly known as the oak-leaved hickory, is a unique variant of the hickory tree characterized by its distinctive foliage. This plant belongs to the walnut family, Juglandaceae, and is native to specific regions in Mexico. Its leaves are broad, lobed, and resemble those of oak trees, giving it its common name. The bark is rugged and grey, with a texture that becomes more fissured as the tree matures. It produces small, round nuts enclosed in a spiky husk, which are typically harvested in the autumn season."
