    "intro": "Justicia ovalifolia var. psammophila, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of bright blue or purple flowers. The plant is adapted to hot, dry environments, with deep roots that help it survive in sandy soils. It is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping in drought-prone areas."
