    "intro": "Jatropha trifida, commonly known as the three-lobed spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are divided into three distinct lobes, and its clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain toxic seeds, which are a defense mechanism against herbivores. Jatropha trifida is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. It is also known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
