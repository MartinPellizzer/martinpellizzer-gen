    "intro": "Juniperus schottii, commonly known as Schott's juniper, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves and small, berry-like cones that mature to a blue-black color. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. Its compact form and slow growth rate make it suitable for rock gardens and as a landscape ornamental. Juniperus schottii is also valued for its aromatic foliage and historical use in traditional medicine."
