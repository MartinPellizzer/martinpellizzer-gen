    "intro": "Jussiaea marginata, commonly known as the coastal bladderwort, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in wet, saline environments such as mangroves and coastal marshes. Its leaves are often submerged or floating, with specialized structures for gas exchange. Jussiaea marginata plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
