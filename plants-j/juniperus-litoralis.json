    "intro": "Juniperus litoralis, commonly known as the coastal juniper, is a hardy evergreen shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, providing a striking visual contrast against the rocky or sandy environments it inhabits. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for various birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in maritime climates with frequent salt spray. Juniperus litoralis is valued for its resilience and is commonly used in landscaping for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand harsh coastal conditions."
