It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often hairy and have a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into spiny, capsule-like fruits containing toxic seeds. It is adapted to survive in dry environments with minimal water requirements. Due to its toxicity, it is not recommended for cultivation or consumption."
