    "intro": "Jussiaea swartziana, commonly known as the swamp jussiaea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the Americas. It is characterized by its erect, slender stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Jussiaea swartziana plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and provides habitat for various insects and microorganisms."
