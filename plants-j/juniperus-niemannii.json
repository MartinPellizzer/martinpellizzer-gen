    "intro": "Juniperus niemannii, commonly known as the Mexican redcedar, is a species of juniper native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree, typically reaching heights of up to 10 meters. The plant has needle-like leaves that are dark green and often have a bluish or whitish bloom, which is a characteristic feature of many juniper species. Its cones, or berries, are small and fleshy, containing toxic seeds that are not typically consumed by humans. The plant is valued for its aromatic wood and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
