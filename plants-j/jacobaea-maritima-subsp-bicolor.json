    "intro": "Jacobaea maritima subsp. bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored ragwort, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow and green leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in saline soils and is often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a weed and can be harmful to livestock."
