    "intro": "Justicia aequilabris, commonly known as the silver bush or Mexican flame flower, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring lance-shaped leaves with a silvery underside. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in clusters at the ends of the branches. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, especially hummingbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure."
