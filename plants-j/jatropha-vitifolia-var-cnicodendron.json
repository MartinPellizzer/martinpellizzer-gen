    "intro": "Jatropha vitifolia var. cnicodendron, commonly known as the silverleaf jatropha, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that have a silvery underside, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange-red berries containing toxic seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded areas and is adapted to humid climates. Due to its ornamental value and potential for medicinal use, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and research settings."
