    "intro": "Juniperus dioica, commonly known as the common juniper, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cupressaceae. It is a coniferous shrub or small tree that typically grows in temperate regions. The plant is characterized by its scale-like leaves and small, berry-like cones that contain the aromatic berries used in culinary and medicinal applications. Juniperus dioica is dioecious, meaning that male and female reproductive structures are found on separate plants. Its botanical features make it well adapted to a variety of soil types and environmental conditions."
