It is characterized by its cascading, drooping branches that create a distinctive, ornamental appearance. This form of juniper is typically smaller than the standard species, with a more compact growth habit. The foliage consists of scale-like leaves that are dark green and retain their color throughout the year. It is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and hardy nature."
