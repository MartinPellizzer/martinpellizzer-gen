    "intro": "Julbernardia ogoouensis, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to western and central Africa. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and simple, alternate leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by oval, woody fruits containing single seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it important in local timber industries. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
