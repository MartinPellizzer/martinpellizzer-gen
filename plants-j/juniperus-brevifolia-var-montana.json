    "intro": "Juniperus brevifolia var. montana, commonly known as the mountain juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. The species is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental appeal."
