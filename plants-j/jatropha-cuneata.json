    "intro": "Jatropha cuneata, commonly known as the narrowleaf jatropha, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits that contain toxic seeds, which are not suitable for consumption. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value and potential for use in phytoremediation, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects."
