It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in clusters during the late spring to early summer. The leaves are compound, with long, narrow leaflets that give the plant a delicate appearance. The tree produces small, round, woody fruits that contain seeds covered in a silky, hairy coating. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well adapted to tropical and subtropical climates."
