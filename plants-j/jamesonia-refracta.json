    "intro": "Jamesonia refracta, commonly known as the western starflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Jamesonia refracta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
