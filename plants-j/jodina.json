    "intro": "Jodina, commonly known as the \"scented willow,\" is a flowering plant belonging to the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like stems and delicate, nodding flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, silky hair, giving the plant a soft appearance. Jodina thrives in moist, shady environments, typically found along streambanks and in woodland areas. Its fragrant flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological importance."
