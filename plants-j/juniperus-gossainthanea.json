    "intro": "Juniperus gossainthanea, commonly known as the Gossainthan Hills juniper, is a rare and endemic coniferous species native to the Himalayan region of India. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub, typically reaching heights of up to 5 meters. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces small, blue-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in forested areas at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Juniperus gossainthanea is considered a vulnerable species."
