    "intro": "Jacea tricolor var. saxatilis, commonly known as the alpine bluebell, is a flowering plant native to the high mountain regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue, violet, and white petals that form a bell-shaped flower. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 2,000 meters. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
