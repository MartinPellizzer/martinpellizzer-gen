    "intro": "Juncus odoratus, commonly known as sweetgrass, is a perennial plant native to wetland areas in North America. It produces tall, cylindrical clusters of small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is characterized by its grass-like leaves and is often found in moist soils along stream banks and marshes. Sweetgrass is known for its pleasant, sweet scent, which becomes more pronounced when the plant is dried. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
