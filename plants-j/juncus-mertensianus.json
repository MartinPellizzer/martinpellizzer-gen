    "intro": "Juncus mertensianus, commonly known as Mertens' rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often reddish or brownish in color, and it produces small, greenish flowers in spike-like clusters. It is well adapted to waterlogged soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Juncus mertensianus is also used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities."
