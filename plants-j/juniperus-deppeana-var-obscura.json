It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that is typically a deep blue-green color, with small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures called juniper berries, which are typically blue or black when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to provide habitat for wildlife."
