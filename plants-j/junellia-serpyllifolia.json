    "intro": "Junellia serpyllifolia, commonly known as common yarrow, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs. Its basal leaves are basal, linear, and often covered in a whitish bloom, while the upper leaves are smaller and more lance-shaped. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in dense clusters at the ends of the stems, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Junellia serpyllifolia is known for its medicinal properties and has been used historically for its anti-inflammatory and astringent qualities."
