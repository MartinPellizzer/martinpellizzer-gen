    "intro": "Juncus hydrophilus, commonly known as the water rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in marshes, pond edges, and other moist habitats, thriving in saturated soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikes of small, greenish or brownish flowers. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic settings. Juncus hydrophilus plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
