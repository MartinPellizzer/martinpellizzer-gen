    "intro": "Juniperus rigida subsp. conferta, commonly known as the dense juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The subspecies is notable for its hardy nature and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
