    "intro": "Juncus communis proles effusus, commonly known as the common rush, is a perennial plant belonging to the Juncaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves that grow from a rhizomatous base. The plant typically thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and damp meadows. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late spring to early summer, consist of small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a loose panicle. The common rush is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
