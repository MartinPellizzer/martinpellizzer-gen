    "intro": "Justicia laevilinguis, commonly known as the woolly justicia, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its flowers are pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure. Justicia laevilinguis is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
