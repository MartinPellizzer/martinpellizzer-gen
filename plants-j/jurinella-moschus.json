    "intro": "Jurinella moschus, commonly known as the musk plant, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in mountainous regions. Its leaves and stems emit a faint musk-like scent, which is believed to be due to the presence of volatile oils. Jurinella moschus is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities."
