    "intro": "Jatropha pungens, commonly known as the spiny jatropha, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its spiny stems and leaves, which provide a natural defense against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into bright red, fleshy fruits. Its seeds are encased in a toxic, sticky substance, which deters seed predators. Jatropha pungens is often found in disturbed soils and is adaptable to various environmental conditions."
