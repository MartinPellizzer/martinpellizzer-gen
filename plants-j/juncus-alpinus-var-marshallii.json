    "intro": "Juncus alpinus var. marshallii, commonly known as the alpine rush, is a perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra environments. It is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate harsh winter conditions. Its botanical features make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
