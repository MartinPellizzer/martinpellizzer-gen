    "intro": "Juncus articulatus f. nigrescens, commonly known as black-stemmed rush, is a variant of the common rush characterized by its dark, almost black stems. It is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. The plant typically grows in moist or wet environments such as marshes, ditches, and along water edges. Its slender, grass-like leaves are arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The botanical features of this plant make it adaptable to wetland ecosystems and useful for ecological restoration projects."
