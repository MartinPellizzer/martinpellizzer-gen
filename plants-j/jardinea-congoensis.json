    "intro": "Jardinea congoensis, commonly known as the Congo water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the freshwaters of Central Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. The plant has broad, waxy leaves that float on the water's surface, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its stems extend beneath the water to support the foliage. Jardinea congoensis plays an important ecological role in its native ecosystems by contributing to water filtration and supporting biodiversity."
