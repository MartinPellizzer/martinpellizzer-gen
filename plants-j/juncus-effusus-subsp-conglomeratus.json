    "intro": "Juncus effusus subsp. conglomeratus, commonly known as the clustered rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It is characterized by its dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a cylindrical stem. The plant produces small, greenish-brown spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Its structure and growth habits make it useful for erosion control and habitat creation for aquatic life."
