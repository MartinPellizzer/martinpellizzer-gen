It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family, which includes morning glories and other vine-like plants. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a velvety texture, while its stems are hairy and twining. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds when mature."
