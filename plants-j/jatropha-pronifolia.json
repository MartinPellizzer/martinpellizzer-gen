    "intro": "Jatropha pronifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf jatropha, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant produces toxic seeds that contain harmful compounds, making it potentially dangerous to humans and animals. It thrives in humid, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils near rivers or forests. Due to its ornamental value and potential for biofuel production, it has been cultivated in some regions despite its toxic properties."
