    "intro": "Juncellus, commonly known as the common rush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Juncaceae. These plants are typically found in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and damp woodlands. Juncellus species are characterized by their cylindrical, grass-like stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that often grow in clusters. The leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and the plants can form dense stands that help prevent soil erosion. They play an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
