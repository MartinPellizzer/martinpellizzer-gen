    "intro": "Jonesiopsis remota, commonly known as the remote Jonesiopsis, is a rare and enigmatic fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that exhibit a unique pattern of venation. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered in sori on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Jonesiopsis remota is considered a conservation concern."
