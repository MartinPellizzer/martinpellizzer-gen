    "intro": "Jacaranda bracteata, commonly known as the velvet jacaranda, is a deciduous tree native to South America. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in spring, adding a dramatic visual display to the landscape. The tree has compound leaves that are opposite and pinnate, with small, ovate leaflets. Its bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age, and it produces distinctive bracteate calyces that persist after flowering. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates."
