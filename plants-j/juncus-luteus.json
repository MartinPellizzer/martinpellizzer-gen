    "intro": "Juncus luteus, commonly known as the yellow rush, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Juncaceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in spikes at the top of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Juncus luteus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
