    "intro": "Juglans regia var. duracina, commonly known as the Persian walnut, is a variant of the common walnut native to the Caucasus and western Asia. It is characterized by its large, thick-shelled nuts and high oil content, which contribute to its commercial value. The tree produces compound leaves with a serrated margin and bears yellowish-green flowers in catkins. Its fruit is typically harvested in late summer and is prized for its rich, nutty flavor. This variety is well adapted to temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
