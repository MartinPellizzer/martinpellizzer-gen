It typically grows in wet, marshy environments and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and tall, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered at the tips of its stems. It is well adapted to cold climates and can thrive in poorly drained soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of Arctic and subarctic ecosystems."
