    "intro": "Jussiaea peruviana stirps macrophylla, commonly known as the giant water hyacinth, is a floating aquatic plant native to South America. It features large, broad leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length, providing a dense canopy on the water surface. The plant produces small, clustered blue or purple flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rapid growth rate makes it both a useful bioindicator and a potential invasive species in non-native habitats."
