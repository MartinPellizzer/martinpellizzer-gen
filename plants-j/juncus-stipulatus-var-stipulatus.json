It is characterized by its grass-like, cylindrical stems that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters at the base of the stems, which are often surrounded by bracts. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
