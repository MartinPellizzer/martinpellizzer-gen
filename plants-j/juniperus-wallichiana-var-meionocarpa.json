    "intro": "Juniperus wallichiana var. meionocarpa, commonly known as the dwarf juniper, is a shrub native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
