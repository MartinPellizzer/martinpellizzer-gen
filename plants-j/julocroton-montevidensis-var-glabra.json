    "intro": "Julocroton montevidensis var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth julocroton, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Uruguay and parts of Brazil. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and leaves, which are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and dry forest environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural reserves."
