It typically grows in moist, rocky or sandy soils, often in tundra or mountainous environments. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are usually leafless, with spikes of small, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds. This subspecies is an important part of the Arctic flora, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for small organisms."
