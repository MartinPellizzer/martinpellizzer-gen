    "intro": "Jurinea hissarica, commonly known as the Caucasian sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the steppes of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. Jurinea hissarica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
