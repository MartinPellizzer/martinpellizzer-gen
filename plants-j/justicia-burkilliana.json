It is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from deep red to orange, often appearing in clusters at the ends of its branches. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its vibrant floral display."
