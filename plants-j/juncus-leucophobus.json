    "intro": "Juncus leucophobus, commonly known as the white-veined rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually pale green with white veins, giving it its common name. Its flowering spikes appear in late spring to early summer, producing small, inconspicuous flowers. Juncus leucophobus plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
