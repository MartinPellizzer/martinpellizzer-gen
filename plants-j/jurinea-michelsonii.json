    "intro": "Jurinea michelsonii, commonly known as the Michelson's sea holly, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California, where it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces showy, blue to violet ray florets surrounded by white to pale blue disk florets, resembling a composite flower. It is typically found in dune habitats and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Jurinea michelsonii is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sand dunes."
