It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces small, greenish fruits that contain toxic seeds, making it important to handle with care. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though its toxicity limits its widespread use."
