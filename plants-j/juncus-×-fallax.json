    "intro": "Juncus \u00d7 fallax, commonly known as the hybrid rush, is a perennial plant native to parts of North America. It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Juncus effusus and Juncus roemerianus. This plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and coastal areas, where it thrives in brackish or freshwater conditions. It has tall, cylindrical stems that are often used in floral arrangements due to their aesthetic appeal. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered at the top of the stems."
