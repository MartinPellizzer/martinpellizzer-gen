    "intro": "Jurinea brevicaulis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sea bladder, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is a low-growing perennial with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its root system is adapted to stabilize sandy soils, making it a common sight in dunes and rocky shores. Jurinea brevicaulis is well-suited to saline and windy conditions, contributing to the ecological stability of coastal ecosystems."
