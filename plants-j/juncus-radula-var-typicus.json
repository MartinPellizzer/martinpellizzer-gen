    "intro": "Juncus radula var. typicus, commonly known as the common rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It features slender, cylindrical stems that grow in dense clusters, often reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences composed of numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture that contributes to its resilience in moist soils. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
