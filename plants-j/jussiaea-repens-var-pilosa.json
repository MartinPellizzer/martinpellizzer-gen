    "intro": "Jussiaea repens var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy trailing willow, is a low-growing perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats or carpets on the ground. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, hairy glands, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. Its flowers are tiny, clustered in spikes, and typically have four petals, often in shades of white or pale pink. This species thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks."
