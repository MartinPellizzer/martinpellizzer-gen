    "intro": "Juncus rupestris f. robusta, commonly known as the robust rush, is a variant of the common rush species native to rocky and coastal habitats. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a vibrant green. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in ecological restoration projects along shorelines and in sandy soils."
