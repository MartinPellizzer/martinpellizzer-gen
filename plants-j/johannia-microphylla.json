    "intro": "Johannia microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved johannia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces daisy-like flowers with yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale blue ray florets. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Johannia microphylla is considered a rare and endangered species."
