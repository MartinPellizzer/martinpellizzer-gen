It is a perennial plant characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that helps it withstand cold and harsh environmental conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing mountainous terrain."
