    "intro": "Jarava hystricina, commonly known as the narrowleaf jarava, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of small, spike-like clusters of flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Jarava hystricina is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
