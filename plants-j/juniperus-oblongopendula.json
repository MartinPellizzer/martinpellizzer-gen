    "intro": "Juniperus oblongopendula, commonly known as the pendulous juniper, is a species of evergreen coniferous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its drooping, scale-like leaves that form dense, cascading clusters, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for various birds and wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous areas. Juniperus oblongopendula is valued for its ornamental qualities and is commonly used in landscaping for its hardiness and visual appeal."
