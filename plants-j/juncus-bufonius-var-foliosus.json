    "intro": "Juncus bufonius var. foliosus, commonly known as the frog's-bit sedge, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. This plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and pond margins, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate and improve water quality."
