    "intro": "Juncus prismatocarpus subvar. viviparus, commonly known as the viviparous rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant produces cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. One of its notable features is the viviparous trait, where the plant can produce viable seeds without fertilization, a rare reproductive strategy. This subvariety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity in wetland habitats."
