    "intro": "Juniperus nepalensis, commonly known as Nepal juniper, is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Juniperus nepalensis plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to soil stabilization and providing shelter for various species."
