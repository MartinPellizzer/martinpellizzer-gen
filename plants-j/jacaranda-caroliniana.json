    "intro": "Jacaranda caroliniana, commonly known as the Carolina jacaranda, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking clusters of violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments, giving the plant a delicate appearance. The tree produces long, slender pods that contain seeds, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
