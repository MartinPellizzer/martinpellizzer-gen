    "intro": "Justicia jalappifolia, commonly known as the red-flowered false arum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Mexico and Central America. It features striking, showy red bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers clustered in spikes, which are surrounded by the vibrant bracts. Justicia jalappifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
