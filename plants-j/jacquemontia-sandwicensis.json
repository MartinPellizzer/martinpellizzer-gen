    "intro": "Jacquemontia sandwicensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian moonflower, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are vine-like and climbing. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
