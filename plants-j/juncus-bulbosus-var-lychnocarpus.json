It features tall, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color and produce small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers. The plant has fibrous roots and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical structure makes it well adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats."
