    "intro": "Juncus bicornis, commonly known as the two-horned rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in dense clusters, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, and features narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish or reddish in color, appearing in late summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. Juncus bicornis plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
