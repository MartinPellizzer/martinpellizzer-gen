    "intro": "Juniperus foetida var. multicaulis, commonly known as the mountain juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. This variety is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value."
