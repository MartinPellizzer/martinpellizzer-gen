    "intro": "Juglans hindsii var. quercinifolia, commonly known as the oak-leaved hickory, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that resemble those of oak trees, giving it its common name. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by edible nuts enclosed in spiny husks. Its bark is thick and deeply furrowed, providing structural support and protection against environmental stress. This variety is valued for its hard, durable wood and its role in local ecosystems."
