    "intro": "Jovibarba hirta subsp. neilreichii, commonly known as the Neilsen's hoary plantain, is a perennial succulent belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The plant is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and compact rosette growth form, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. It produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, which are clustered in a composite head. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, making it suitable for xeriscaping in dry climates."
