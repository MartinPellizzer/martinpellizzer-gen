    "intro": "Jatropha ferox, commonly known as the poisonwood tree, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and the Americas. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, often thorny stems and dark green, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits containing toxic seeds. Its sap and all parts of the plant contain irritants and toxins, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Despite its toxicity, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though with caution."
