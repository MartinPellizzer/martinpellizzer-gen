    "intro": "Jasminanthes kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu jasmine, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It is a member of the Oleaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, often found in montane forest ecosystems. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a glossy surface, while its flowers emit a strong, sweet aroma. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
