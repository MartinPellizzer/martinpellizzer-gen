    "intro": "Jurinea polyclonos, commonly known as the desert sandflower, is a low-growing, perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It features a compact rosette of silver-green, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its adaptations include deep root systems and a slow growth rate, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Jurinea polyclonos plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and inland deserts."
