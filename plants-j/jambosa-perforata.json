    "intro": "Jambosa perforata, commonly known as the African star fruit or wild starfruit, is a small, evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Achariaceae and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by edible, star-shaped fruits that are typically sour and tangy. The fruit is often consumed fresh or used in traditional remedies, and the plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal. Its growth habit makes it suitable for cultivation in subtropical and tropical regions with well-drained soil."
