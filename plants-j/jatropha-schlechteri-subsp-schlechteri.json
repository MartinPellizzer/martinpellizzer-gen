    "intro": "Jatropha schlechteri subsp. schlechteri, commonly known as the Schlechter's physic nut, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by spiny, capsule-like fruits containing toxic seeds. It is part of the Euphorbiaceae family, known for its milky sap and diverse ecological roles. Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided by herbivores, which contributes to its survival in natural habitats."
