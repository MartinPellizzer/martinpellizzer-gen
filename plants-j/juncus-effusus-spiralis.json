    "intro": "Juncus effusus spiralis, commonly known as the spiral rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that spirals upward in a distinctive, twisting pattern. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that emerge from the leaf axils, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. Juncus effusus spiralis plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
