    "intro": "Juncellus serotinus f. contortus, commonly known as the twisted rush, is a variant of the silver rush native to wetland habitats. It is characterized by its tightly coiled, cylindrical stems that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, often in moist or saturated soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a silver-gray sheen that helps reflect sunlight. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
