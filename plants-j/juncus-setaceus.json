    "intro": "Juncus setaceus, commonly known as the slender rush, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Juncaceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its fibrous structure makes it useful in ecological restoration projects and as a natural water filter."
