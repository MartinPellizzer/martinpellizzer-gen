    "intro": "Jurinea mollis subsp. subhastata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to harsh, dry environments. This subspecies is often found in steppe and desert habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
