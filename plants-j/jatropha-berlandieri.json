    "intro": "Jatropha berlandieri, commonly known as the Mexican physic nut, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its woody stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that develop into capsule fruits containing toxic, orange-red seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, while its seeds are a source of oil, though they contain harmful compounds. Jatropha berlandieri is also known for its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments."
