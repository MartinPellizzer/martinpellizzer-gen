    "intro": "Juniperus willkommii, commonly known as the African red juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces blue or purple berries that are borne in cone-like structures, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils and in coastal areas. Juniperus willkommii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
