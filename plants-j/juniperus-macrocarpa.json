    "intro": "Juniperus macrocarpa, commonly known as the eastern red cedar, is a species of coniferous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and small, scale-like leaves that are typically dark green in color. The tree produces blue-gray berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for various wildlife species. It has a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, making it a long-lived and resilient plant. The bark of Juniperus macrocarpa is often reddish-brown and becomes fissured with age, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
