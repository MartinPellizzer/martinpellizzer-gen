    "intro": "Jungia schuerae, commonly known as the Schuera's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and reeds, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in high-altitude grasslands and mountainous areas. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
