    "intro": "Justicia somalensis, commonly known as the Somali flame flower, is a shrub native to the dry regions of Somalia and Ethiopia. It is characterized by its striking, tubular, bright red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, especially sunbirds, which are attracted to their vibrant colors and nectar-rich blooms."
