    "intro": "Jatropha staphysagriifolia, commonly known as the staghorn plant, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that resemble the antlers of a stag, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into capsule fruits containing toxic seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid lowland forests. Due to the toxicity of its seeds, it is important to handle the plant with care."
