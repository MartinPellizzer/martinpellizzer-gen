    "intro": "Juncellus pustulatus, commonly known as the blister rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features tall, cylindrical stems that are often covered in small, rounded bumps or blisters, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spike-like clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically growing in dense tufts at the base of the plant. Juncellus pustulatus plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
