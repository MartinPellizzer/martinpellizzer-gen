    "intro": "Juniperus lutchuensis var. maritima, commonly known as the coastal juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, needle-like leaves and small, berry-like cones that mature to a blue-black color. The plant is adapted to saline and sandy soils, often growing in coastal dunes and near the shoreline. It has a slow growth rate and is valued for its resilience in harsh maritime environments. This variety plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for local wildlife."
