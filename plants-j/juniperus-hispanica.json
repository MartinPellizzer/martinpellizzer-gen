    "intro": "Juniperus hispanica, commonly known as the Spanish juniper, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and northern Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, needle-like leaves and produces small, blue-black berries that are used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions. Its cones, which are actually berry-like structures, mature over a two-year cycle. Juniperus hispanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
