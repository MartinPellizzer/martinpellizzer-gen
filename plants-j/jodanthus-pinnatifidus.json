    "intro": "Jodanthus pinnatifidus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed jodanthus, is a flowering plant native to parts of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically arranged in spikes, with a distinctive coloration that ranges from purple to red. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside of its native region."
