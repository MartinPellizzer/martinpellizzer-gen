    "intro": "Jacobaea maritima, commonly known as sea ragwort, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines, thriving in saline and windy conditions. Its yellow flowers bloom in late summer, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Jacobaea maritima is often found in maritime habitats and is adapted to withstand harsh coastal environments."
