    "intro": "Jasione dentata f. dubravkiana, commonly known as the Dubravka's toothed bellflower, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of blue or violet. The plant features basal leaves that are toothed and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are usually unbranched and somewhat hairy. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in some areas."
