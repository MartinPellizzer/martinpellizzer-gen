    "intro": "Juglans granatensis, commonly known as the Persian walnut, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Iran and Central Asia. It belongs to the walnut family, Juglandaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and large, edible nuts. The tree produces flowers in spring, with male and female flowers occurring on separate trees. Its nuts are encased in a thick, green husk that splits open when mature, revealing a hard shell surrounding the edible kernel. This species is valued for its timber and as a source of nutritious nuts, though it is less commonly cultivated than other walnut varieties."
