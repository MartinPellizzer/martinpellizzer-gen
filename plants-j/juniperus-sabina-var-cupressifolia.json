    "intro": "Juniperus sabina var. cupressifolia, commonly known as the creeping juniper, is a low-growing shrub with dense, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. It produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans and animals. The plant is native to regions of Europe and western Asia, often found in rocky or sandy soils. It has a compact, mat-forming growth habit, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its aromatic foliage and evergreen nature contribute to its ornamental value in horticulture."
