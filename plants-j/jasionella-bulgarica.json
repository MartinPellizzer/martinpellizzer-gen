    "intro": "Jasionella bulgarica, commonly known as the Bulgarian grass or narrow-leaved grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southeastern Europe. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, erect stems and linear, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 cm in length. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets and bloom in early summer. Jasionella bulgarica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
