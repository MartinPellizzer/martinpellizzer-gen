    "intro": "Juncus leschenaultii var. major, commonly known as the giant rush, is a perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in spike-like clusters during the spring and summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
