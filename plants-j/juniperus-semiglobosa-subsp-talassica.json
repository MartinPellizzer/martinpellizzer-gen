    "intro": "Juniperus semiglobosa subsp. talassica, commonly known as the coastal juniper, is a subspecies native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a small, evergreen shrub or tree that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant has needle-like leaves that are blue-green in color and produce small, dark blue berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. It is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. This subspecies plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
