    "intro": "Juncus hylanderi, commonly known as the Hyland's rush, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, stream banks, and marshy areas. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color and lack leaves, instead having small, scale-like structures. Its flowers are small and clustered in spike-like inflorescences, usually appearing in late summer to early fall. Juncus hylanderi plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
