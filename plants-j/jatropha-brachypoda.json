    "intro": "Jatropha brachypoda, commonly known as the short-stemmed physic nut, is a perennial shrub native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its woody stems, alternate leaves with three to five lobes, and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain toxic seeds, which are not suitable for human consumption. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions."
