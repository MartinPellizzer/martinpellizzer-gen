    "intro": "Josephinia, commonly known as the Mexican moonflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Josephinia mexicana, which is native to Mexico and parts of Central America. The plant is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The flowers have a strong, sweet scent that becomes more pronounced in the evening. Josephinia is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique blooming habit and striking appearance."
