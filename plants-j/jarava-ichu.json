    "intro": "Jarava ichu, commonly known as the Andean hairgrass, is a perennial grass native to the high altitudes of South America, particularly in the Andes. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures. Jarava ichu plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
