    "intro": "Juncus maritimus subsp. rigidus, commonly known as the rigid rush, is a perennial plant native to coastal areas of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and upright growth habit, often forming dense mats in saline or brackish wetlands. The plant has narrow, cylindrical leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters at the tips of its stems, which are pollinated by wind. This subspecies is adapted to tolerate high salinity and periodic flooding, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
