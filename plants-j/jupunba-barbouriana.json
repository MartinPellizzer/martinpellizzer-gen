It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its umbellate inflorescence. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has finely divided, fern-like leaves. It produces small white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
