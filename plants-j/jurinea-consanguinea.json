    "intro": "Jurinea consanguinea, commonly known as the coastal bladderwrath, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal areas. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are succulent and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. Jurinea consanguinea plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
