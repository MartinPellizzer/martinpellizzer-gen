    "intro": "Jatropha fremontioides, commonly known as the Fremont's spurge, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along stream banks. The plant produces yellow flowers that are followed by orange or red berries, which contain toxic seeds. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a distinctive waxy coating. Jatropha fremontioides is adapted to withstand drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
