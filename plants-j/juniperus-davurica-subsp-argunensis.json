    "intro": "Juniperus davurica subsp. argunensis, commonly known as the Siberian juniper, is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to the cold climates of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which are typically blue-green in color and arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental qualities."
