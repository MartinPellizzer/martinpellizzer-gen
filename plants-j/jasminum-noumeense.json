    "intro": "Jasminum noumeense, commonly known as the New Caledonia jasmine, is a flowering plant native to the island of New Caledonia in the South Pacific. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with woody stems and dark green, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, usually during the warmer months. Its leaves are simple and opposite, with a slightly hairy texture on the underside. Jasminum noumeense is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat and is often found in coastal areas and moist forests."
