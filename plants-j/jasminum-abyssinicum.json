    "intro": "Jasminum abyssinicum, commonly known as Ethiopian jasmine, is a flowering plant native to Ethiopia and parts of the Horn of Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and opposite, simple leaves. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the evening, which attract nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and the flowers have a strong, sweet aroma. Jasminum abyssinicum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
