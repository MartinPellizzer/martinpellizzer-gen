    "intro": "Juglans regia var. tenuissima, commonly known as the Persian walnut or slender-leaved walnut, is a botanical variant of the Persian walnut tree. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically shorter and more delicate compared to the standard variety. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, which are wind-pollinated. Its nuts are generally smaller and have a thinner shell than those of the typical Persian walnut. This variant is native to regions of Central Asia and is valued for its ornamental qualities and edible nuts."
