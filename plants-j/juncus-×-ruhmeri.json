    "intro": "Juncus \u00d7 ruhmeri, commonly known as the hybrid rush, is a perennial plant belonging to the Juncaceae family. It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Juncus effusus and Juncus roemerianus, two species native to coastal and wetland environments. The plant typically forms dense clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets of greenish or brownish flowers. It thrives in brackish or saline water, making it well adapted to coastal marshes and estuaries. Due to its hybrid nature, it is not found in the wild and is usually cultivated for erosion control and ornamental purposes."
