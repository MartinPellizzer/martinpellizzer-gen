    "intro": "Juniperus scopulorum f. argentea, commonly known as the silver juniper, is a variant of the Rocky Mountain juniper. It is characterized by its silvery-white or grayish foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically scale-like and closely pressed to the branches, contributing to its dense, compact growth habit. This form is often found in rocky or well-drained soils in higher elevations. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and adaptability to harsh environmental conditions."
