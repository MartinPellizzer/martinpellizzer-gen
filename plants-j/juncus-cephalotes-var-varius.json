    "intro": "Juncus cephalotes var. varius, commonly known as the variable rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America. It features tall, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color and can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically growing in dense clusters at the base of the plant. This variety is valued for its ability to thrive in saturated soils and its role in stabilizing shoreline ecosystems."
