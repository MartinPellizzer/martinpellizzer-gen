    "intro": "Juniperus brevifolia subsp. maritima, commonly known as the coastal juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal areas of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of aromatic wood. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. This subspecies is notable for its resilience and ecological importance in coastal ecosystems."
