    "intro": "Juniperus malacocarpa, commonly known as the Mexican redcedar, is a species of juniper native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen conifer with needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. The tree is valued for its durable wood and has been used historically for construction and furniture-making."
