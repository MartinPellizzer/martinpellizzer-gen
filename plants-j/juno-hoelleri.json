    "intro": "Juno hoelleri, commonly known as the Ghost Plant, is a striking succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its pale blue or white, translucent leaves that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its unique common name. The plant features a low-growing, spreading habit with rosettes of fleshy, waxy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. It produces small, pale yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a subtle contrast to its ghostly foliage. Juno hoelleri is prized in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soil with minimal water."
