    "intro": "Juglans longirostris, commonly known as the long-beaked hickory, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the walnut family, Juglandaceae, and is characterized by its long, slender nuts enclosed in a thick, husky shell. The tree produces compound leaves with long, slender leaflets and has a distinctive, rugged trunk with a thick, flaky bark. Its flowers are dioecious, with separate male and female plants, and it relies on insects for pollination. The nuts are valued for their rich, nutty flavor and are used both in culinary applications and for wildlife food sources."
