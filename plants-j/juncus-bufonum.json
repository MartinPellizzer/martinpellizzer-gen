    "intro": "Juncus bufonum, commonly known as the toad plant, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often near water bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of white or pale yellow flowers. Its botanical name reflects its association with toads, as the plant is sometimes found in habitats where toads reside. Juncus bufonum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in moist conditions."
