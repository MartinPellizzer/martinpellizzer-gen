    "intro": "Juncus bufonius f. minutulus, commonly known as the dwarf bulrush, is a compact, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important species for wetland ecosystems. Its short stature and dense growth habit make it effective for erosion control and habitat provision for aquatic organisms."
