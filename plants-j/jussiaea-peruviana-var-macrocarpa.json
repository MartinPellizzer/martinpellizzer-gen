    "intro": "Jussiaea peruviana var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in wet, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and marshes. Its leaves are often submerged, while its stems and roots are adapted for aquatic conditions. The varietal name \"macrocarpa\" refers to its relatively large, inflated fruit capsules."
