    "intro": "Juniperus virginiana var. bermudiana, commonly known as the Bermuda juniper, is a variant of the eastern red cedar. It is a small, evergreen shrub or tree that typically grows in coastal areas, particularly in Bermuda. The plant has needle-like leaves that are blue-gray in color and are arranged in whorls around the stem. It produces small, dark blue berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. This variety is notable for its adaptability to saline and well-drained soils."
