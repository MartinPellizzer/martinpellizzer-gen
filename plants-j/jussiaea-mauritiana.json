    "intro": "Jussiaea mauritiana, commonly known as the coastal bladderwort, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, herbaceous leaves and distinctive, bladder-like structures that aid in trapping small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in moist, saline environments such as salt marshes and coastal areas. Its flowers are usually white or pale blue, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Jussiaea mauritiana plays a role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various aquatic invertebrates."
