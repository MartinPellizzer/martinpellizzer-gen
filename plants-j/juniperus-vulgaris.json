    "intro": "Juniperus vulgaris, commonly known as common juniper, is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color and its distinctive red or purple berries, which are actually fleshy cones. The plant is widely distributed across Europe, Asia, and North America, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. It has a long history of use in herbal medicine and as a source of aromatic wood. The botanical features of Juniperus vulgaris make it well adapted to harsh environments and contribute to its ecological significance."
