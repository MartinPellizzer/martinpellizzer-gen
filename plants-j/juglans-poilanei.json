    "intro": "Juglans poilanei, commonly known as the Poilane walnut, is a species of flowering plant in the Juglandaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central America, particularly in countries such as Mexico and Guatemala. The tree produces large, edible nuts enclosed in a thick, green husk that splits open when mature. Its leaves are alternate, compound, and have serrated edges, while its bark is smooth and grayish in color. The Poilane walnut is valued for its hardy nature and the high quality of its nuts, which are used in both culinary and commercial applications."
