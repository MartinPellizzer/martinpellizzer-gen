    "intro": "Jacquinia macrocarpa subsp. pungens, commonly known as the hairyleaf willow-herb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows, streambanks, and roadside ditches. The plant features slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy on both surfaces, and have a slightly aromatic scent when crushed. The small, white to pale pink flowers appear in clusters and bloom in late spring to early summer, contributing to its ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
