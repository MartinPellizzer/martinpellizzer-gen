    "intro": "Juniperus virginiana, commonly known as eastern red cedar, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, scale-like leaves and produces small, blue-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for various wildlife species. The tree has a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, often forming dense stands in dry, rocky soils. Its wood is highly durable and has been historically used for fence posts and cedar chests. The plant also plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and stabilizing soil in its native range."
