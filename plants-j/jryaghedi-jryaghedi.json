    "intro": "Jryaghedi jryaghedi, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of small, pale flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to its humid, shaded habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
