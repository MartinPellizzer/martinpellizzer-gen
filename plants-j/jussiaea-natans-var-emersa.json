It is a perennial herb that typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant is characterized by its spongy, floating stems that allow it to remain buoyant on the water surface. Its leaves are small, rounded, and often clustered at the base of the stems. This species plays a role in stabilizing water bodies and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
