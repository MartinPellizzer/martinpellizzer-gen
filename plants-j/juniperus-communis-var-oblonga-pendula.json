    "intro": "Juniperus communis var. oblonga-pendula, commonly known as the weeping juniper, is a variant of the common juniper characterized by its cascading, drooping branches. It is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The foliage consists of scale-like leaves that are dark green and densely packed, giving the plant a compact appearance. It produces small, blue-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and small mammals. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes due to its unique, flowing form."
