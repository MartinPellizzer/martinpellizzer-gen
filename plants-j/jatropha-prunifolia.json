    "intro": "Jatropha prunifolia, commonly known as the redroot jatropha, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its distinctive red or orange roots and its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate or elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into capsule fruits containing toxic seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its toxicity, it is generally avoided as a food source and is more commonly found in wild or cultivated landscapes."
