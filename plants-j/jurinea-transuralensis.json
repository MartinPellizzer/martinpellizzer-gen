    "intro": "Jurinea transuralensis, commonly known as the Transural Sea Blume, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, commonly known as the ice plant family, and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, star-shaped flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions. It typically grows in rocky soils and is often found in alpine or steppe habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
