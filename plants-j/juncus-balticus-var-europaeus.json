    "intro": "Juncus balticus var. europaeus, commonly known as the European rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats across Europe. It features tall, cylindrical stems that are typically green to reddish in color, often reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in dense spikes, which are typically greenish or brownish in hue. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist soils. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife."
