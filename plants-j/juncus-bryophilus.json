    "intro": "Juncus bryophilus, commonly known as the mossy rush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Juncaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish flowers in dense spikes. It is often found growing in association with mosses, which is reflected in its common name. Juncus bryophilus is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse microhabitats."
