    "intro": "Jacea cineraria, commonly known as the ash-gray plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer months. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, this plant is adapted to survive in dry conditions with minimal water requirements. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight. Jacea cineraria is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
