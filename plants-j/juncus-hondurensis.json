    "intro": "Juncus hondurensis, commonly known as the Honduran rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to Central America. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves that form a compact rosette. The plant typically grows in moist or wet environments, such as marshes and along stream banks. Its flowering spikes consist of small, greenish flowers that are often subtended by bracts. Juncus hondurensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
