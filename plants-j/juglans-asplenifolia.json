    "intro": "Juglans asplenifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf walnut, is a species of flowering plant in the family Juglandaceae. It is native to the western United States, particularly in areas of California and Nevada. The plant is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that resemble those of the asplenium fern, hence its scientific name. Its fruit is a walnut-like drupe, containing a single seed surrounded by a hard shell. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and has also been studied for its potential ecological and economic importance."
