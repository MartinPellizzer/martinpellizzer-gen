    "intro": "Jasminum rupestre, commonly known as the rock jasmine, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arid and rocky regions of southern Africa. It features small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in its native environment. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
