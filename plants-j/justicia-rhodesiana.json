    "intro": "Justicia rhodesiana, commonly known as the red-hot poker, is a striking plant native to South Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that features tall, spiky inflorescences with bright red bracts that resemble poker chips. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which attract pollinators like bees and birds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which can last from summer through fall."
