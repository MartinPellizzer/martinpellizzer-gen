    "intro": "Juncus stygius subsp. grossii, commonly known as the giant bog rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, often growing in dense clusters. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in spike-like inflorescences, which are typically borne at the top of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and they are adapted to thrive in water-saturated soils. This subspecies is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
