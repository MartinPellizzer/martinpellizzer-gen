    "intro": "Jatropha mcvaughii, commonly known as the McVaugh's physic nut, is a species of flowering plant in the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its spiny stems and yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain toxic seeds, which are a key feature of the genus Jatropha. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it an adaptable species in harsh climates. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by herbivores, contributing to its survival in natural habitats."
