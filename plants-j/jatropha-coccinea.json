    "intro": "Jatropha coccinea, commonly known as the blood flower or crimson cup, is a strikingly ornamental plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that produces vibrant red, cup-shaped flowers, which are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and its milky, toxic sap that contains latex. Jatropha coccinea thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. However, due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
