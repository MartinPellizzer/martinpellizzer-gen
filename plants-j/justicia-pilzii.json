    "intro": "Justicia pilzii, commonly known as the red flame plant, is a striking ornamental shrub native to South Africa. It features vibrant red bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, tubular yellow flowers that are pollinated by insects. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its compact growth habit and long-lasting blooms make it a popular choice for gardens and containers."
