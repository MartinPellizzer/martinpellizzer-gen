    "intro": "Jatropha heterophylla, commonly known as the variable jatropha, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with leaves that can be either ovate or lanceolate depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by capsules containing toxic, orange-red seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
