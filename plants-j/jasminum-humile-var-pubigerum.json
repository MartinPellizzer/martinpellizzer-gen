    "intro": "Jasminum humile var. pubigerum, commonly known as the common jasmine or small jasmine, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often emitting a sweet scent. The plant typically grows as a shrub or vine, with opposite, simple leaves that are usually hairy on the underside. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and aromatic properties. The variety 'pubigerum' is distinguished by its pubescent (hairy) foliage, which sets it apart from other jasmine species."
