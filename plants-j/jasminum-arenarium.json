    "intro": "Jasminum arenarium, commonly known as the desert jasmine, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant has slender, woody stems and small, leathery leaves adapted to conserve water. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for harsh, dry environments. Its ability to survive in extreme conditions makes it an important species in ecological studies of desert flora."
