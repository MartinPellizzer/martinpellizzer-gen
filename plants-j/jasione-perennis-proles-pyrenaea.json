    "intro": "Jasione perennis proles pyrenaea, commonly known as the Pyrenean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and branched. This species is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological adaptations to high-altitude environments."
