    "intro": "Juncus glaucus var. inflexus, commonly known as the blue rush, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that forms compact clumps, with slender, cylindrical stems that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes during the summer months, which are often hidden among the foliage. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland gardens."
