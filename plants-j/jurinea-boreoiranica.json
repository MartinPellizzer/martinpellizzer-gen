    "intro": "Jurinea boreoiranica, commonly known as the Central Asian sandflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in steppes and deserts. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions. Its foliage is typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Jurinea boreoiranica plays a role in stabilizing soils and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
