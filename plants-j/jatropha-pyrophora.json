    "intro": "Jatropha pyrophora, commonly known as the flameleaf jatropha, is a shrub native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, fiery red to orange foliage that changes with the seasons. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by orange or red berries that contain toxic seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though caution is needed due to its toxic properties."
