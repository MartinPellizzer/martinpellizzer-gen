    "intro": "Juncellus serotinus, commonly known as the late-flowering rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and damp woodlands. The plant features tall, cylindrical stems that are often reddish or purplish in color, and it produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and arranged in dense clusters at the base. Juncellus serotinus plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
