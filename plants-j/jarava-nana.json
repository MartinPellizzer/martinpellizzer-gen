    "intro": "Jarava nana, commonly known as dwarf jarava, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It typically reaches heights of less than 10 inches and has fine, needle-like leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flower clusters during the summer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and arid environments. Jarava nana is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
