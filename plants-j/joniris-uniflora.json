    "intro": "Joniris uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, solitary flower that typically blooms in late summer or early autumn. The plant has a slender stem and narrow, grass-like leaves, which help it survive in its harsh, cold environment. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Joniris uniflora is considered a vulnerable species."
