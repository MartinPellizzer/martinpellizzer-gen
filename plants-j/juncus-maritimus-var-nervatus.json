    "intro": "Juncus maritimus var. nervatus, commonly known as the nervy sea rush, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a perennial herb that thrives in saline or brackish wetlands, often found in estuaries and tidal flats. The plant has cylindrical, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green with a prominent midrib, and it produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers. It plays an important ecological role by stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms. Its ability to tolerate saltwater makes it an important species in coastal vegetation."
