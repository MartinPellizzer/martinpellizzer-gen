    "intro": "Jatropha sellowiana, commonly known as the Sellow's physic nut, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and produces yellow flowers that are followed by spiny capsules containing toxic seeds. The plant is part of the Euphorbiaceae family, known for its milky sap and diverse species. Jatropha sellowiana is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
