    "intro": "Juniperus japonica var. pyramidalis, commonly known as the Japanese cedar or Japanese white pine, is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to Japan. It features a conical or pyramidal shape with dense, needle-like leaves that are dark green and slightly twisted. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Its slow growth rate and hardy nature make it suitable for coastal and temperate climates."
