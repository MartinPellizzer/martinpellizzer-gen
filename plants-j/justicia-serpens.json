    "intro": "Justicia serpens, commonly known as the snake plant or mother of millions, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its long, trailing stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, or yellow. The plant is adapted to thrive in low-light conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are typically narrow and elongated, often forming a dense mat that can spread rapidly. Justicia serpens is popular as a houseplant due to its resilience and ability to purify indoor air."
