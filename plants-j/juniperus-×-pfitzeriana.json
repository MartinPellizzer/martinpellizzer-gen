    "intro": "Juniperus \u00d7 pfitzeriana, commonly known as the Austrian juniper, is a hybrid coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage that is typically dark green and often retains its color year-round. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It is commonly used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness in colder climates. The species is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its tolerance to urban environments."
