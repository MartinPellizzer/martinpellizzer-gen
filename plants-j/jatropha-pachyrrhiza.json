It is characterized by its thick, woody stems and large, lobed leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by orange or red berries containing toxic seeds. It is often found in dry, disturbed habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for food or ornamental purposes."
