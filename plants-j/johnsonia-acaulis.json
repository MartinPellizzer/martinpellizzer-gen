    "intro": "Johnsonia acaulis, commonly known as the naked stem Johnsonia, is a rare and striking plant native to the high altitudes of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often hairy stems that lack leaves, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom during the warmer months. Johnsonia acaulis thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
