    "intro": "Justicia barlerioides, commonly known as the flame flower, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and arranged oppositely along the stems. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
