    "intro": "Jussiaea fluctuans, commonly known as the floating bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its flowers emerge above the water surface. Jussiaea fluctuans is a carnivorous plant, relying on both photosynthesis and the digestion of prey for survival."
