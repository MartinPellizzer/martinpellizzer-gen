    "intro": "Jatropha macrophylla, commonly known as the giant cupplant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that are followed by orange-red, fleshy fruits containing toxic seeds. Jatropha macrophylla is often found in moist, shady environments such as swamps and along stream banks. Its striking foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening, though caution is advised due to its toxic properties."
