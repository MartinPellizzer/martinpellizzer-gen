    "intro": "Jatropha villosa var. genuina, commonly known as the hairy jatropha, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by orange or red berries containing toxic seeds. It is often found in arid or semi-arid regions, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its toxicity, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
