It is a member of the Juncaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and spikes of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. The few-flowered rush is an important component of riparian ecosystems, providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
