    "intro": "Juniperus thurifera proles gallica, commonly known as the Galician juniper, is a subspecies of the juniper shrub native to the coastal regions of Galicia in northwestern Spain. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and strong winds. This subspecies plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
