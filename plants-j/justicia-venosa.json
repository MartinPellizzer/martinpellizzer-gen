    "intro": "Justicia venosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf false arum, is a tropical flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with bright red bracts that enclose small, white flowers. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
