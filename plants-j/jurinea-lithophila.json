    "intro": "Jurinea lithophila, commonly known as the rock jurinea, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically thrives on rocky outcrops and dry soils. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer seasons. Its leaves are usually small, fleshy, and adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Jurinea lithophila is often found in mountainous areas and is well-suited to survive in nutrient-poor, well-drained substrates."
