    "intro": "Justicia rubropicta, commonly known as the flame flower, is a tropical plant native to Central America and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its striking red-orange bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, surrounded by the showy bracts. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Justicia rubropicta is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant and long-lasting floral display."
