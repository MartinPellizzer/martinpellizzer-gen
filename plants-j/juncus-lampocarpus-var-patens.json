    "intro": "Juncus lampocarpus var. patens, commonly known as the coastal rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest. It has slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of pale green to brown flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in tidal zones and wetlands. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and fluctuating water levels makes it an important part of coastal ecosystems."
