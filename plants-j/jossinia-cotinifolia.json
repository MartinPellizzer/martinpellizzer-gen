    "intro": "Jossinia cotinifolia, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its striking red foliage in the autumn, which makes it a popular ornamental plant. The tree has opposite, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red, orange, and yellow in the fall. Its small, winged seeds are dispersed by wind, and it produces clusters of greenish-yellow flowers in early spring. Jossinia cotinifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas."
