    "intro": "Juncus muelleri, commonly known as Mueller's rush, is a perennial plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Juncaceae and is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along waterways, where it thrives in moist to waterlogged soils. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late spring to early summer, consist of small, greenish flowers that are often clustered together. Juncus muelleri plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
