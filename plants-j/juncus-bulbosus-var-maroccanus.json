It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and the presence of bulb-like structures at the base of its stems. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its flowering stems bear small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in dry environments."
