It features heart-shaped, palmate leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are typically arranged in clusters. Jossinia hastilis is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural areas. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a common weed and a subject of ecological study."
