    "intro": "Jatropha varians, commonly known as the variable spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by capsule fruits containing toxic, orange-red seeds. Jatropha varians is known for its latex sap, which is milky and can cause skin irritation. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands."
