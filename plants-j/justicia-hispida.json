    "intro": "Justicia hispida, commonly known as red flame or Mexican wheelcactus, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a shrub-like perennial with upright, branching stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and slightly hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Justicia hispida is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
