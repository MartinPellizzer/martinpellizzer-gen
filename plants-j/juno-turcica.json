    "intro": "Juno turcica, commonly known as the Turkish juniper, is a species of evergreen shrub belonging to the Cupressaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Turkey and the eastern Mediterranean, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves and small, blue-black berries that are used in traditional medicine. Juno turcica is also valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in the production of incense and as a source of essential oils. Its resilience to harsh climates makes it an important component of the local flora in its native habitat."
