    "intro": "Justicia floribunda, commonly known as the red-hot poker, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and the southern United States. It is characterized by its tall, spike-like inflorescences that bear vibrant red bracts, which are not true flowers but modified leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Justicia floribunda is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
