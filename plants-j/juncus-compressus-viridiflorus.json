    "intro": "Juncus compressus viridiflorus, commonly known as the greenflower rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It features slender, grass-like stems that grow in dense clusters, often reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spike-like inflorescences, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and cylindrical, with a smooth, waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
