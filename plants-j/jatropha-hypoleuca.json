    "intro": "Jatropha hypoleuca, commonly known as the whiteleaf jatropha, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into capsule fruits containing toxic, orange-red seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Due to the toxicity of its seeds, it is important to handle the plant with care."
