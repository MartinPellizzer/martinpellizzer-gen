    "intro": "Juncus ensifolius var. minor, commonly known as the narrowleaf rush, is a flowering plant belonging to the Juncaceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its flowering stems bear small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense spikes. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
