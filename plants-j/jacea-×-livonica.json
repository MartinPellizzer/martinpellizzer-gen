    "intro": "Jacea \u00d7 livonica, commonly known as the hybrid carnation, is a cross between Jacea and Livonia species, resulting in a plant with vibrant, showy flowers. It typically features dense, bushy growth with tightly packed petals that come in a wide range of colors. The plant is native to temperate regions and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens and floral arrangements. Due to its hybrid nature, it may not produce viable seeds, making propagation through cuttings or division more common."
