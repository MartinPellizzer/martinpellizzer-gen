    "intro": "Jaltomata anteropilosa, commonly known as the anteropilous jaltomata, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains in South America. It belongs to the family Solanaceae, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually oval-shaped with a hairy texture, and it produces berries that contain the seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, Jaltomata anteropilosa is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
