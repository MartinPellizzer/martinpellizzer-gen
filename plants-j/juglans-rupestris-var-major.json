    "intro": "Juglans rupestris var. major, commonly known as the large rock hickory, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its rugged, often twisted trunk and thick, fissured bark. The leaves are compound, typically with 11 to 21 leaflets, and are dark green on top with a pale underside. Its nuts are encased in a thick, spiny husk and are typically edible after the husk is removed. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or hilly areas."
