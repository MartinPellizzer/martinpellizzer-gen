    "intro": "Jacquinia toldensis, commonly known as the Toldan snowbell, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to cold, high-altitude conditions. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, contributing to its survival in harsh climates. Jacquinia toldensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
