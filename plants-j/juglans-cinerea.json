    "intro": "Juglans cinerea, commonly known as the bitternut walnut, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and heart-shaped leaves with a serrated margin. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by woody, spiky fruits containing one or two edible nuts. The nuts are encased in a thick, bitter husk and are typically harvested in the fall. This species is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in riparian zones and mixed woodlands."
