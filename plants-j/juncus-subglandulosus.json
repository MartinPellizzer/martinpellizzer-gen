    "intro": "Juncus subglandulosus, commonly known as the glandular rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with small, glandular dots, giving it its scientific name. Its flowering spikes consist of numerous small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Juncus subglandulosus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
