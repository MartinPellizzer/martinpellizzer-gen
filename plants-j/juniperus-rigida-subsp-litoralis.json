    "intro": "Juniperus rigida subsp. litoralis, commonly known as the coastal juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal areas of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are usually blue or purple when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. This subspecies is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value."
