    "intro": "Juniperus alba, commonly known as the white juniper, is a coniferous evergreen shrub or tree native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its pale blue-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its distinctive, scale-like leaves that are tightly packed along the stems. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. Juniperus alba is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, cold climates. It is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in difficult growing conditions."
