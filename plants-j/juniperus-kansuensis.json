    "intro": "Juniperus kansuensis, commonly known as the Chinese juniper, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to China. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves and small, blue-gray berries that remain on the plant for years. The tree typically reaches heights of 3 to 10 meters and has a conical or irregular shape. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its hardy nature makes it suitable for ornamental planting in colder climates."
