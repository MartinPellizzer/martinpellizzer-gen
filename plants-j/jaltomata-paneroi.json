    "intro": "Jaltomata paneroi, commonly known as the Panero's jaltomata, is a species of flowering plant in the Solanaceae family. It is native to the highlands of Ecuador and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forest habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Jaltomata paneroi is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
