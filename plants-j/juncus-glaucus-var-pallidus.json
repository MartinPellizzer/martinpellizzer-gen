    "intro": "Juncus glaucus var. pallidus, commonly known as the pale bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, cylindrical stems that are typically pale green to bluish-gray in color. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of white to pale green flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. This variety is adapted to moist soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams."
