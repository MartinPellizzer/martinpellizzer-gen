    "intro": "Juncus lampocarpus niger, commonly known as black rush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Juncaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of dark brown to black spikelets, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as along the edges of ponds and in swamps. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a dense mat that helps stabilize soil. This species is native to parts of North America and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits."
