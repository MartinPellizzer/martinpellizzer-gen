    "intro": "Justicia aquatica var. exigua, commonly known as waterwheel plant, is a perennial aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that float on the water surface. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of pink or purple, which are typically borne on slender stems. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds and marshes. Its unique appearance and ability to form dense mats make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
