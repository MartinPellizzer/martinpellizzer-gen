    "intro": "Juncoides spadicea var. parviflora, commonly known as the narrowleaf rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It features slender, grass-like stems that grow in dense clusters, typically reaching heights of 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in spike-like inflorescences, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a slightly hairy texture. This variety is adapted to moist soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats."
