    "intro": "Juniperus barbadensis subsp. saxicola, commonly known as the rock juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are often used in traditional medicine and as a spice. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its native habitat. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in coastal and mountainous environments."
