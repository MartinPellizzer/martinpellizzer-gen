    "intro": "Jacobaea opuntiifolia, commonly known as the Mexican goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its succulent, spineless stems that resemble those of cacti, and its yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open habitats. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Jacobaea opuntiifolia is also known for its medicinal properties, with some traditional uses in herbal remedies."
