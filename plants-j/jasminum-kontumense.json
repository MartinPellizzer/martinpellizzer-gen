It is characterized by its fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer seasons. The plant has slender, woody stems and lance-shaped leaves that are dark green in color. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
