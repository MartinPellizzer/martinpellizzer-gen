    "intro": "Juniperus tremolsii, commonly known as the Sierra juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, needle-like leaves and small, blue-black berries that are often used in herbal medicine. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, mountainous environments. Its cones, which mature over several years, are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Juniperus tremolsii plays a significant role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
