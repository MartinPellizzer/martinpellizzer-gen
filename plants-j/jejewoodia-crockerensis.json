    "intro": "Jejewoodia crockerensis, commonly known as Crocker's spurge, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with characteristic cyathia, or cup-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, displaying a low, sprawling growth habit. Its leaves are opposite and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The showy yellow flowers are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts, which are a defining feature of the genus."
