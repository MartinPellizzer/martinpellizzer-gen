    "intro": "Jurinea naxia, commonly known as the Afghan sandflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is well adapted to harsh, dry environments, with small, narrow leaves that reduce water loss. Its pale yellow to white flowers bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Jurinea naxia plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in desert and steppe habitats."
