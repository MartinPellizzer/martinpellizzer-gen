    "intro": "Justicia pilosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Mexican verbena, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red, often blooming in summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Justicia pilosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
