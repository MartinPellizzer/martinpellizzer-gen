    "intro": "Jonesiopsis incensum, commonly known as the flame orchid, is a unique tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, flame-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture from the air. Its flowers are usually bright red or orange, with a strong, spicy fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Jonesiopsis incensum is considered a delicate and endangered species."
