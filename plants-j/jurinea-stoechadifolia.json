    "intro": "Jurinea stoechadifolia, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dune environments. Its structure is low-growing with a rosette of leaves, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Jurinea stoechadifolia is well adapted to harsh coastal conditions, making it a resilient species in maritime ecosystems."
