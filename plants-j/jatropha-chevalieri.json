    "intro": "Jatropha chevalieri, commonly known as the Madagascar castor or yellow jatropha, is a shrub native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its smooth, green stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that give way to orange-red, spiny capsules containing toxic seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in dry, rocky soils. Due to the toxicity of its seeds, it is important to handle the plant with care."
