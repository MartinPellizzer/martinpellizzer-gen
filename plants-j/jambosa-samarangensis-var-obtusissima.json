    "intro": "Jambosa samarangensis var. obtusissima, commonly known as the blunt-leaved jambosa, is a rare and lesser-known species of the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are broad and rounded, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible, sweet fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
