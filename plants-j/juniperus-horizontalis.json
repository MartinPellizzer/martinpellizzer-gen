    "intro": "Juniperus horizontalis, commonly known as creeping juniper, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to arid and rocky regions of North America. It features dense, scale-like foliage that forms a mat or carpet on the ground, often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental appeal. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are typically blue or purple in color, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Juniperus horizontalis is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in dry environments."
