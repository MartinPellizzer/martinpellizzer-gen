    "intro": "Juncus alpinus f. pygmaeus, commonly known as the alpine sedge, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length, forming dense tufts near the ground. The plant produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that bloom in late summer, adding subtle texture to alpine habitats. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly environments at high elevations. Due to its compact size and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine arrangements."
