    "intro": "Jacea \u00d7 pseudopannonica, commonly known as the hybrid poppy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Europe. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Jacea fragilis and Jacea pseudopannonica, though its exact parentage remains uncertain. The plant features showy, bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Jacea \u00d7 pseudopannonica is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and is relatively easy to grow in temperate climates."
