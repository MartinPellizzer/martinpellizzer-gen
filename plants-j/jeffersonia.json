    "intro": "Jeffersonia, commonly known as the Jeffersonia nuttallii, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, which includes buttercups and other showy wildflowers. The plant features simple, alternate leaves with a distinctive heart-shaped base and produces small, yellow flowers with five petals. Jeffersonia thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for ecosystem health."
