    "intro": "Juncoides intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clumps of slender, grass-like stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and cylindrical, often with a slight sheen, and are adapted to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions. Juncoides intermedia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
