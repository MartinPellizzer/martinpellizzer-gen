    "intro": "Juglans columbiensis, commonly known as the Columbian walnut, is a species of flowering plant in the family Juglandaceae. It is native to the western United States, particularly in the states of California, Oregon, and Washington. The tree can grow up to 20 meters tall and is characterized by its compound leaves and edible nuts enclosed in a spiky husk. Its bark is thick and ridged, and it produces both male and female flowers on the same tree. The plant is valued for its wood, which is strong and durable, and for its nuts, which are a food source for various wildlife species."
