    "intro": "Jasminum wallichianum, commonly known as the Chinese jasmine or winter jasmine, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, often before the leaves appear. These flowers are clustered in racemes and emit a sweet, intoxicating scent. It is widely cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its hardiness and beautiful blossoms."
