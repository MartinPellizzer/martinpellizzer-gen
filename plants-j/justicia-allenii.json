    "intro": "Justicia allenii, commonly known as the orange ball plant, is a flowering shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of bright orange bracts that resemble small balls, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which are pollinated by birds and insects. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its vibrant, eye-catching appearance."
