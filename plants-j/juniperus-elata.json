    "intro": "Juniperus elata, commonly known as the Rocky Mountain juniper, is a hardy evergreen shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage and small, blue-gray berries that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to rocky and mountainous terrain. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to survive in poor soil conditions. Juniperus elata plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
