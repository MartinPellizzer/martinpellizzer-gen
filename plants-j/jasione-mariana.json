    "intro": "Jasione mariana, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-green foliage, which help it thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often found in dunes and rocky shores. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Jasione mariana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
