    "intro": "Juncus sylvaticus subsp. rugosus, commonly known as the rough sedgeland rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as along riverbanks and in swampy areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often rough to the touch, giving it its subspecific name. Its inflorescence consists of dense, cylindrical spikes of small, three-lobed flowers. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
