    "intro": "Julostylis ampumalensis, commonly known as the Ampumalensis Stylis, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique, showy bracts that resemble small, colorful leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
