    "intro": "Juncus prismatocarpus subvar. thermalis, commonly known as the thermal rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. The plant has narrow, cylindrical leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in suitable habitats. The species is characterized by its ability to thrive in high-temperature and saline conditions, making it an important component of certain wetland ecosystems."
