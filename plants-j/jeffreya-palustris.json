    "intro": "Jeffreya palustris, commonly known as the marsh gentian, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils and thrives in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Jeffreya palustris plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining the ecological balance of wetland ecosystems."
