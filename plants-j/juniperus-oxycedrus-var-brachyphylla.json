    "intro": "Juniperus oxycedrus var. brachyphylla, commonly known as the dwarf juniper or Mediterranean juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and hardiness."
