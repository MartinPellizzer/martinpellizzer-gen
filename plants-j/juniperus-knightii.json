    "intro": "Juniperus knightii, commonly known as the Knight's juniper, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color and often covered with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Juniperus knightii is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and attractive appearance."
