    "intro": "Juncus conglomeratus, commonly known as the clustered rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It forms dense clumps of grass-like, cylindrical stems that are typically reddish-brown in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil in marshy areas, making it an important species for wetland ecosystems. Juncus conglomeratus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions."
