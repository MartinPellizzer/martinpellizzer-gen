    "intro": "Juncus niveus, commonly known as the snowgrass, is a perennial plant native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, white spikelets that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its hollow, cylindrical stems are often used in floral arrangements, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems. Juncus niveus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
