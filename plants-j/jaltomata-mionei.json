    "intro": "Jaltomata mionei, commonly known as the Mione's jaltomata, is a flowering plant native to the highlands of Mexico. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and thrives in cooler, temperate climates. Its leaves are usually ovate with a hairy surface, and it produces berries that contain the seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Jaltomata mionei is considered a rare and endangered species."
