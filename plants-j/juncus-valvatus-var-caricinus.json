    "intro": "Juncus valvatus var. caricinus, commonly known as the narrowleaf rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually green or brown, appearing in late summer to early fall. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along stream banks. This variant is distinguished by its narrow leaves and is often confused with other rush species due to its similar appearance."
