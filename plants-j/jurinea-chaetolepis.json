    "intro": "Jurinea chaetolepis, commonly known as the woolly sea-blume, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly coating of white hairs that cover its stems and leaves, providing protection against harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle floral display to its habitat. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, often in areas subject to strong winds and salt spray. Due to its specialized adaptations, Jurinea chaetolepis is an important component of coastal ecosystems in its native range."
