    "intro": "Jumelleanthus perrieri, commonly known as the Perrier's jumelleanthus, is a rare flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive yellow-orange flowers with prominent central disc florets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to the arid conditions of its native environment. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
