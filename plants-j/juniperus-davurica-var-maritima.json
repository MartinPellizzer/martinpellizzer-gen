    "intro": "Juniperus davurica var. maritima, commonly known as the coastal juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, which consists of scale-like leaves arranged in dense, compact clusters. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are adapted to survive in harsh, salty coastal environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or rocky coastal areas. This variety is notable for its resilience to salt spray and wind, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
