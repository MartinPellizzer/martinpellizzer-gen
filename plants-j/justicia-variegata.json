It is a flowering shrub that produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which attract pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white or cream markings, adding to its visual appeal. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its vibrant blooms and adaptability, it is a popular choice for gardeners in warm climates."
