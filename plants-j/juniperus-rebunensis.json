    "intro": "Juniperus rebunensis, commonly known as the Rebun juniper, is a coniferous evergreen shrub native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spherical blue or black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and small mammals. Juniperus rebunensis thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in gardens and landscapes."
