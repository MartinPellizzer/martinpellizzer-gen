    "intro": "Juncellus lateralis, commonly known as the slender rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It typically grows in dense clusters, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters, with cylindrical, grass-like leaves that are often reddish or purple at the base. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny greenish-white flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil in moist habitats, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Juncellus lateralis is adapted to tolerate waterlogged conditions and is often found in temperate regions across Europe and Asia."
