It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits that contain toxic seeds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Jatropha hirsuta is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in dry, arid conditions. Its ecological role includes providing habitat for various insects and birds, though it is considered a weed in some areas."
