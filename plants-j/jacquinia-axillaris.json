    "intro": "Jacquinia axillaris, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with unique floral structures. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia, a characteristic feature of the Euphorbiaceae family. Jacquinia axillaris is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
