    "intro": "Justicia heterocarpa subsp. praetermissa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf false arum, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of South America. It features upright stems with opposite, lanceolate leaves that are often tinged with purple along the veins. The plant produces striking, violet-bronze bracts that enclose small, white flowers arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in tropical gardens. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is less commonly cultivated outside its native range."
