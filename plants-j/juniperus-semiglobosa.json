    "intro": "Juniperus semiglobosa, commonly known as the globe juniper, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its spherical shape, dense foliage, and blue-gray needles that provide year-round color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Juniperus semiglobosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand drought and poor soil conditions."
