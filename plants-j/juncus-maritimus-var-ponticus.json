    "intro": "Juncus maritimus var. ponticus, commonly known as the Pontic rush, is a perennial plant native to coastal and brackish wetlands in the eastern Mediterranean. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish flowers in summer. The plant is adapted to saline and waterlogged soils, making it a common species in estuaries and tidal marshes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming extensive mats that stabilize shorelines. It plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and reducing erosion."
