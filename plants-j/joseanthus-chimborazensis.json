    "intro": "Joseanthus chimborazensis, commonly known as the Chimborazo bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of Ecuador. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, typically above 3,500 meters, where it grows in rocky or alpine soils. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, adapting to the harsh climatic conditions of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
