    "intro": "Juncus monanthos, commonly known as the common rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves and produces spikes of small, greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of aquatic ecosystems. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Juncus monanthos is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions."
