    "intro": "Julocroton villosissimus, commonly known as the woolly croton, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, or pubescent, stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a garden plant."
