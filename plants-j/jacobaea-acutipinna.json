    "intro": "Jacobaea acutipinna, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ragwort, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as meadows, pastures, and rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and sharply pointed, with a rough texture, and it produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom from late summer to autumn. Jacobaea acutipinna is also known for its toxic properties, containing pyrrolizidines that can be harmful to livestock and humans if ingested."
