    "intro": "Juncus baekdusanensis, commonly known as the Baekdusan rush, is a flowering plant native to the Korean Peninsula, particularly found in the mountainous regions of North Korea. It belongs to the Juncaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in forested or alpine environments. Its slender, cylindrical stems are often clustered together, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. Juncus baekdusanensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates in its native ecosystem."
