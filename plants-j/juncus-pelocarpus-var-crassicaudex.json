    "intro": "Juncus pelocarpus var. crassicaudex, commonly known as the broad-tailed rush, is a perennial wetland plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in marshy areas, pond edges, and along streams, where it thrives in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color, and it produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and they form dense clumps that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. This variety is distinguished by its broader, more robust leaves compared to other juncus species."
