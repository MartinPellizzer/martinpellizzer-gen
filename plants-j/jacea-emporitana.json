    "intro": "Jacea emporitana, commonly known as the Socotra cypress, is a unique and rare tree species native to the island of Socotra in the Indian Ocean. It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-shaped crown and its long, narrow, scale-like leaves. The plant belongs to the family Cupressaceae and is known for its slow growth and longevity, with some trees living over 1,000 years. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and thick, waxy bark that helps it survive in the arid climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, Jacea emporitana is considered a vulnerable species."
