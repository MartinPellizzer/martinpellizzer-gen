    "intro": "Johnstonia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its striking, pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a short, stout stem and narrow, grass-like leaves that remain green throughout the growing season. Johnstonia is notable for its ability to thrive in cold, moist environments with poor soil conditions. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is highly sought after by botanists and plant enthusiasts alike."
