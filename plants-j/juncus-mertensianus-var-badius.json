    "intro": "Juncus mertensianus var. badius, commonly known as the dark blue rush, is a perennial plant native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that forms compact clumps, with slender, cylindrical stems that often display a striking dark blue or purple hue. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in early summer, which are borne in spike-like clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
