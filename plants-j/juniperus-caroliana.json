    "intro": "Juniperus caroliana, commonly known as the Eastern redcedar, is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and whitish underneath, forming dense, compact foliage. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and prairies. Juniperus caroliana is also valued for its aromatic wood and its role in traditional medicine."
