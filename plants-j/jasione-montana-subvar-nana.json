    "intro": "Jasione montana subvar. nana, commonly known as the dwarf rock jasmine, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features compact, mat-forming growth with small, hairy leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are followed by small, bladder-like seed pods. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and as a ground cover in dry, sunny environments."
