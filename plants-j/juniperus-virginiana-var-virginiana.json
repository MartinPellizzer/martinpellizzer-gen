    "intro": "Juniperus virginiana var. virginiana, commonly known as the eastern red cedar, is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, needle-like leaves and produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to livestock. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun. It is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to form dense thickets. The wood of this species is valued for its durability and resistance to decay."
