    "intro": "Juncus oliganthus, commonly known as the few-flowered rush, is a perennial plant native to various regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and damp woodlands. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower spikes during the summer months. Its botanical characteristics include fibrous roots and a rhizomatous growth habit, which help it thrive in waterlogged soils. Juncus oliganthus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
