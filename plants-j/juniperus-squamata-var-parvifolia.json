It features small, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, providing a dense and ornamental appearance. The plant produces tiny, spherical blue berries that are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a foundation plant. Its slow growth rate and hardy nature make it suitable for a variety of climates."
