    "intro": "Jamesbrittenia atropurpurea subsp. pubescens, commonly known as the purpleleaf ironwood, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and dark purple foliage that becomes more pronounced in the autumn. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming in late spring. Its leaves are covered in a fine layer of pubescence, giving the subspecies its name. This species is well adapted to arid conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
