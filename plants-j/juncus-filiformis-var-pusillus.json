It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length, forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are usually greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in shallow water or damp soil, making it a common species in wetlands and stream banks. Its compact size and adaptability make it an important component of aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems."
