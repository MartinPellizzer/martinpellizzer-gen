    "intro": "Justicia petiolaris subsp. incerta, commonly known as the red-flowered false arum, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy red bracts that resemble those of an arum, though it is not closely related to true arums. The plant features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often surrounded by the vibrant bracts. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses due to its dramatic appearance."
