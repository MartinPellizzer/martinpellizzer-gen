    "intro": "Jungia vitocensis, commonly known as the Mexican bellflower, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with hairy stems and opposite leaves. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it produces small, round berries that contain the seeds. Jungia vitocensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities."
