    "intro": "Jussiaea brachycarpa var. puberula, commonly known as the hairy water primrose, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, white to pink flowers and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common wetland species. Its reproductive structures are adapted for water dispersal, and it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems. The varietal name 'puberula' refers to its pubescent (hairy) surface, which is a distinguishing feature."
