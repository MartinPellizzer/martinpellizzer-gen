    "intro": "Jarava speciosa var. manqueclensis, commonly known as the Manquecl\u00e9n jarava, is a perennial grass native to the arid regions of northern Chile. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, blade-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation. This variety plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is part of the local flora in its native habitat."
