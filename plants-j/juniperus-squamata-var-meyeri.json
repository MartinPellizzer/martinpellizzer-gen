    "intro": "Juniperus squamata var. meyeri, commonly known as the Meyer's juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its scale-like leaves that are tightly pressed against the stems. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are typically eaten by birds and other wildlife. It is well adapted to harsh, arid environments and can tolerate poor soil conditions. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in landscaping."
