It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as riverbanks and coastal areas. The plant has narrow, cylindrical leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of pale green to brown flowers. It is characterized by its dense growth habit and ability to thrive in saline environments. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its tolerance of poor soil conditions."
