It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms dense mats of silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually pink or white, appearing in early summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and steppe regions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
