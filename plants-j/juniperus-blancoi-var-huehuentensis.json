    "intro": "Juniperus blancoi var. huehuentensis, commonly known as the Huemul juniper, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of central Chile. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree, typically growing in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain the aromatic, edible berries used for various purposes. Its leaves are scale-like and closely pressed to the branches, contributing to its dense, compact form. This species is adapted to harsh, cold climates and plays a significant ecological role in its native habitat."
