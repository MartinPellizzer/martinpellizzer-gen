    "intro": "Jurinea botschantzevii, commonly known as the Botchantzev's sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or rocky soils, often found in maritime environments. The plant produces striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with hairy leaves adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Jurinea botschantzevii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
