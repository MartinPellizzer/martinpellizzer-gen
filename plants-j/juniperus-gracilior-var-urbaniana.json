    "intro": "Juniperus gracilior var. urbaniana, commonly known as the urban juniper, is a low-growing shrub native to urban environments in North America. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves that form compact, often mat-like growth patterns. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are typically retained on the plant for extended periods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is highly tolerant of pollution, making it a common sight in city landscapes. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
