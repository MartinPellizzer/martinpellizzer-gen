    "intro": "Juncus coenosus, commonly known as the clustered rush, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its dense clusters of grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation, which helps stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife. Juncus coenosus plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and water filtration."
