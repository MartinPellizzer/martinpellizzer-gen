    "intro": "Juncus stellatus, commonly known as the star sedge, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is a perennial grass-like plant that grows in dense clumps, often in moist or flooded soils. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spikelets, giving it a star-like appearance. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland habitats. Juncus stellatus is also an important food source for various wildlife species."
