    "intro": "Juncus alpinus var. rariflorus, commonly known as the alpine rush, is a flowering plant belonging to the Juncaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and is typically found in alpine and subalpine regions. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of white or pale green flowers, which are usually inconspicuous. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitats."
