    "intro": "Juncus parryi, commonly known as Parry's rush, is a perennial plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense clusters of grass-like leaves and spikes of small, greenish-yellow flowers. This plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form extensive colonies, which can stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife. Juncus parryi is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
