    "intro": "Justicia caudatifolia, commonly known as the flame flower or red flame plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking, tubular, red-orange flowers that bloom in dense clusters, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. It prefers well-draining soil and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. Justicia caudatifolia is also known for its ability to propagate through stem cuttings, making it relatively easy to grow."
