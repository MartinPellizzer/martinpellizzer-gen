    "intro": "Justicia peckii, commonly known as the flame flower, is a striking tropical plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant, tubular red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stem. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Justicia peckii is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
