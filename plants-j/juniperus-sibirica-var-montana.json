    "intro": "Juniperus sibirica var. montana, commonly known as the Siberian juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the cold regions of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces blue-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, arctic or alpine environments. This variety is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value in colder climates."
