    "intro": "Juncus drummondii var. parryi, commonly known as Parry's rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Juncaceae and is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and swampy areas. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters near the base of the stems, which are pollinated by wind. This variety is distinguished by its compact growth habit and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
