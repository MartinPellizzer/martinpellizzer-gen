    "intro": "Juniperus virginiana var. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate red cedar, is a low-growing shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features dense, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, providing a striking visual contrast against its dark bark. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscapes."
