    "intro": "Jurinea glycacantha, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it reflect sunlight and conserve moisture. The plant thrives in coastal areas and sandy soils, adapting to harsh, saline environments. Its structure includes a basal rosette of leaves and elongated stems that bear the showy flowers. Jurinea glycacantha is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
