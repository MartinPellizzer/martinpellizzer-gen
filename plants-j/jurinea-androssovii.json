    "intro": "Jurinea androssovii, commonly known as the Androsowian sandflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing annual herb with narrow, linear leaves adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in steppe and desert environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
