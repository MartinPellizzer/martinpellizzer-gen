    "intro": "Jacquemontia parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved morning glory, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves and produces small, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant is characterized by its trailing growth habit and is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and thickets. Its flowers have five petals and are typically surrounded by a calyx with five lobes. The seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind."
