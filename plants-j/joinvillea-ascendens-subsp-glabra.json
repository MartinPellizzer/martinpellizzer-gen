It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a smooth, glabrous surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is appreciated by both horticulturists and collectors."
