    "intro": "Justicia ramosa, commonly known as the red-rooted false arum, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking, often violet or purple bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in dense spikes, typically in shades of white or yellow. Its stems are often reddish or purplish, giving it its common name, and it thrives in moist, shady environments. Justicia ramosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to attract pollinators."
