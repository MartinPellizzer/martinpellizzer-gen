    "intro": "Justicia asperula, commonly known as roughleaf false forget-me-not, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, rough hairs. The plant produces clusters of blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Justicia asperula is often used in native plant gardens due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
