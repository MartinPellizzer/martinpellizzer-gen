    "intro": "Jatropha fischeri, commonly known as the Fischer's cupplantain, is a perennial herb native to the Canary Islands. It features a rosette of broad, waxy, blue-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces yellow flowers that develop into toxic, orange-red berries containing seeds. It is adapted to coastal and rocky habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and potential for biofuel use, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects."
