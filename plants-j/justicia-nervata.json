    "intro": "Justicia nervata, commonly known as the slender flame flower, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy and have a serrated edge. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in clusters, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which attract pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often used in ornamental gardening. The species is also valued for its ability to tolerate partial shade and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
