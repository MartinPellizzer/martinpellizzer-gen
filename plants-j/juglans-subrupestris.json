    "intro": "Juglans subrupestris, commonly known as the rock hickory, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the walnut family, Juglandaceae, and is characterized by its rugged, often twisted trunk and dense, dark green foliage. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by edible nuts enclosed in spiny husks. Its wood is hard and durable, making it valuable for carpentry and furniture-making. The plant is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in dry, upland habitats."
