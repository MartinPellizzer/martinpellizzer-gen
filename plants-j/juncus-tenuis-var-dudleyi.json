    "intro": "Juncus tenuis var. dudleyi, commonly known as Dudley's rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-white flowers. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil in wetland habitats. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions."
