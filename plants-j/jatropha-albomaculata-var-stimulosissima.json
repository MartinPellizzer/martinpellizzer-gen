    "intro": "Jatropha albomaculata var. stimulosissima, commonly known as the stimulant jatropha, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It features glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which can release a milky latex when damaged. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into spiny, three-lobed capsules containing toxic seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a rough texture. The species is notable for its potential in biofuel production due to its high oil content in the seeds."
