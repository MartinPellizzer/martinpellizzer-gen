    "intro": "Juncus breviculmis, commonly known as the short-stemmed rush, is a perennial plant belonging to the Juncaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, cylindrical flower spikes that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. This plant thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. Its root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic habitats. Juncus breviculmis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and adaptability."
