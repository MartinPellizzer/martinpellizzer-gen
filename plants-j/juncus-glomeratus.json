    "intro": "Juncus glomeratus, commonly known as the clustered rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and moist soils in North America. It features tall, cylindrical stems that are typically green to reddish in color, and it produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers at the top of the plant. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a compact rosette at the base. It is often found in marshy areas, stream banks, and other wet environments where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife. Juncus glomeratus is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in saturated conditions."
