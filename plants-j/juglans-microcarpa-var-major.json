It is native to Mexico and parts of Central America, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, and its fruit is a large, spiky walnut that matures in late summer. The tree can grow up to 15 meters tall, with a broad, rounded crown and thick, fissured bark. It is valued for its edible nuts and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
