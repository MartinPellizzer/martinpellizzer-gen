    "intro": "Juniperus sabina var. variegata, commonly known as the variegated juniper, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the mountains of central and eastern Europe. It features scale-like leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a decorative plant in landscapes. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated for its unique foliage and hardy nature."
