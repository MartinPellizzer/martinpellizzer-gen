    "intro": "Justicia palustris, commonly known as swamp verbena, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetlands and marshy areas in the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, or white, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Justicia palustris is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
