    "intro": "Jacobaeastrum subsessile, commonly known as the narrow-leafed thistle, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features gray-green, narrow, and spiny leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small yellow flowers bloom in the summer, and the plant produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. Jacobaeastrum subsessile is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions."
