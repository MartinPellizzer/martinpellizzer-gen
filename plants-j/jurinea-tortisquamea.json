    "intro": "Jurinea tortisquamea, commonly known as the coastal sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the arid and saline environments of the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with succulent, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are capable of tolerating high salinity, making it well-suited for coastal dunes and rocky shores. Jurinea tortisquamea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and preventing erosion in its native habitat."
