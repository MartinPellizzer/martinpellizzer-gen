    "intro": "Juncus sprengelii, commonly known as the Sprengel's rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia, including China and Korea. It typically grows in moist or wet environments such as marshes, swamps, and stream banks. The plant features tall, cylindrical stems that are often reddish or greenish in color, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters near the tips of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. Juncus sprengelii is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
