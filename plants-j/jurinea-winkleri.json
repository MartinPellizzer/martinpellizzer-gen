    "intro": "Jurinea winkleri, commonly known as the desert sandflower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with silver-gray foliage adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access water from underground sources. Jurinea winkleri plays a vital role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
