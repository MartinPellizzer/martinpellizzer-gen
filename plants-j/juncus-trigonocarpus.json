    "intro": "Juncus trigonocarpus, commonly known as the three-angled rush, is a perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It is characterized by its triangular stems, which are often covered in a layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or reddish in color, appearing in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and they are often used in basket weaving due to their fibrous texture. Juncus trigonocarpus plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wetland organisms."
