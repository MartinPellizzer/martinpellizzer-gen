It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland dunes. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is adapted to withstand arid conditions. Jarava brachychaeta plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for various small organisms."
