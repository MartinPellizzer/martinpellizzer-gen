    "intro": "Justicia huberi, commonly known as the desert candle, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that produces striking spikes of tubular, violet-blue flowers during the summer months. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers. The flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, making it an important nectar source in its native habitat."
