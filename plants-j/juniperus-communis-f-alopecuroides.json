    "intro": "Juniperus communis f. alopecuroides, commonly known as the creeping juniper, is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. It features scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, providing a striking visual contrast against the ground. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. It is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in rocky soils and coastal areas. This form of juniper is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
