    "intro": "Juncus effusus var. costulatus, commonly known as the ribbon grass, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are often ribbed or channelled, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically borne on slender stalks. It thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes, streambanks, and wet meadows. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
