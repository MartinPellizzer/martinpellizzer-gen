    "intro": "Juniperus sabina var. mongolensis, commonly known as the Mongolian juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the cold climates of East Asia. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves and small, berry-like cones that mature to a blue-black color. This species is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in sandy or rocky soils and tolerating extreme temperature fluctuations. The plant is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in landscaping. Its ability to withstand drought and poor soil conditions makes it a hardy choice for arid and semi-arid regions."
