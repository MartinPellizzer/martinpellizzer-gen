    "intro": "Juniperus flaccida var. typica, commonly known as the desert juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its grayish bark, needle-like leaves, and small, blue-gray berries that are toxic to humans but serve as food for birds and small mammals. The plant is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
