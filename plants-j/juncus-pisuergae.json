    "intro": "Juncus pisuergae, commonly known as the Pisuerga rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Europe. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along riverbanks and wet meadows. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color and bear small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture. Juncus pisuergae plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates in its native wetland environments."
