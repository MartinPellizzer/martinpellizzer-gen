    "intro": "Jacksonia compressa, commonly known as the narrowleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in coastal and wetland environments, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its flowers are yellow and resemble those of the common dandelion, but it has distinctive narrow, grass-like leaves. Jacksonia compressa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
