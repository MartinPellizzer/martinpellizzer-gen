    "intro": "Justicia striata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed flame flower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial or shrub, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its stems are woody and can become somewhat branched with age, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Justicia striata is valued in horticulture for its vibrant floral display and adaptability to various soil types."
