    "intro": "Juniperus communis var. fastigiata, commonly known as the upright juniper or columnar juniper, is a compact, coniferous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, needle-like leaves that are blue-green in color, arranged in compact clusters. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. It is widely cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its neat, columnar growth habit. This variety is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and landscape borders."
