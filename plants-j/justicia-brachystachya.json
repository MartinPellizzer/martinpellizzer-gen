    "intro": "Justicia brachystachya, commonly known as the dwarf flame flower, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features striking, tubular, brightly colored flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its compact size and vibrant blooms, it is a popular choice for gardeners looking to add color to containers or small garden spaces."
