    "intro": "Jacobaea aquatica var. erratica, commonly known as the wandering water ragwort, is a variant of the water ragwort species native to Europe. It is a herbaceous plant that typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and stream banks. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, with flowering stems that bear yellow-orange flowers in composite inflorescences. It is often found in disturbed aquatic habitats and can spread through vegetative reproduction. Due to its habitat preferences, it plays a role in supporting local insect populations and ecological succession in wetland areas."
