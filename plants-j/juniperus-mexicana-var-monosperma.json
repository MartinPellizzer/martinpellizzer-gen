    "intro": "Juniperus mexicana var. monosperma, commonly known as the single-seeded juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, needle-like leaves and produces small, blue-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and small mammals. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its botanical features include compact growth habits and a long lifespan, often exceeding 100 years. This variety is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat in desert ecosystems."
