    "intro": "Jurinea kultiassovii, commonly known as the Kultiassov's sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble single blooms. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, featuring silver-gray foliage that reduces water loss through transpiration. Its flowers, which are typically blue or purple, bloom in late summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
