    "intro": "Justicia heterostegia, commonly known as the velvetleaf or tropical flame flower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which bloom in summer. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by birds and insects, and the plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and clearings. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds."
