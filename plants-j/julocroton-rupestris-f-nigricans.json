    "intro": "Julocroton rupestris f. nigricans, commonly known as the black-leaved julocroton, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features dense, dark green foliage with a striking contrasting blackish-green underside, giving it a unique visual appeal. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle floral touch. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Its ornamental value lies in its foliage and ability to tolerate dry conditions once established."
