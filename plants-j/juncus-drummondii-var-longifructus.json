    "intro": "Juncus drummondii var. longifructus, commonly known as Drummond's rush, is a perennial sedge native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces cylindrical spikelets that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its inflorescence is characterized by elongated, drooping clusters of greenish to brownish flowers. This variant is distinguished by its longer fruiting structures compared to other varieties of Juncus drummondii."
