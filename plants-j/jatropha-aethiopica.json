    "intro": "Jatropha aethiopica, commonly known as the Abyssinian physic nut, is an annual shrub native to Africa. It features alternate, simple, and often hairy leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers followed by orange to red, fleshy fruits containing toxic seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in dry regions. However, its seeds contain toxic compounds, which limit its use in agriculture and ornamental gardening."
