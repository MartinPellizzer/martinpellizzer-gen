    "intro": "Juncus pygmaeus var. brachycarpus, commonly known as the dwarf rush, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a low-growing mat, typically reaching heights of less than 10 centimeters. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of white or pale green flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. Its compact size and ability to stabilize soil make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
