    "intro": "Jacaranda trianae, commonly known as the Tenerife jacaranda, is a flowering tree native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer. The tree has a broad, spreading canopy with bipinnate leaves that are dark green and glossy. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for urban landscaping, though it is somewhat rare in cultivation. The wood is hard and durable, historically used for construction and furniture."
