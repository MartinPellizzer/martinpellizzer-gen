    "intro": "Juncus tenuis var. bicornis, commonly known as the narrowleaf rush with two horns, is a flowering plant in the family Juncaceae. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, clustered spikelets of flowers. This variety is native to certain regions of North America, particularly in wetland and marshy habitats. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, and it produces two distinct, elongated bracts at the base of the inflorescence, giving it its common name. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms in its native environment."
