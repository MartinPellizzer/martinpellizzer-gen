    "intro": "Juniperus texensis, commonly known as the Texas juniper, is a hardy evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage and small, blue-gray berries that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for landscaping in dry regions. Juniperus texensis plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
