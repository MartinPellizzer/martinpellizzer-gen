    "intro": "Juncus columbianus, commonly known as the Columbia rush, is a perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It has fibrous roots that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Juncus columbianus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance."
