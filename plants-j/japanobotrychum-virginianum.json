    "intro": "Japanobotrychum virginianum, commonly known as the Virginia grass or Virginia bottlebrush, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, reddish-brown spikelets that resemble bottle brushes. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
