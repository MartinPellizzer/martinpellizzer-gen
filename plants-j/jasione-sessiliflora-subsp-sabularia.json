It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and alpine meadows. The plant features basal rosettes of linear, sessile leaves and produces small, pinkish to white flowers in clusters. Its flowers are typically visited by various pollinators, including bees and flies. The subspecies is characterized by its compact growth form and its ability to thrive in harsh, nutrient-poor environments."
