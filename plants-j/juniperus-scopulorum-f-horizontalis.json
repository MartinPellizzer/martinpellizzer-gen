    "intro": "Juniperus scopulorum f. horizontalis, commonly known as the creeping juniper, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It features dense, flattened sprays of scale-like leaves that give it a distinctive, mat-forming appearance. The plant produces small, blue-gray berries that are typically retained on the branches through winter. It is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. This ornamental plant is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
