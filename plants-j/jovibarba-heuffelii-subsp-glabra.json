    "intro": "Jovibarba heuffelii subsp. glabra, commonly known as the smooth rock crasswolffia, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Due to its slow growth and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
