It is characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a container plant. The flowers are pollinated primarily by hummingbirds and bees, making it an important plant for attracting pollinators."
