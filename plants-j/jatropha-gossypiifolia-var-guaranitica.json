    "intro": "Jatropha gossypiifolia var. guaranitica, commonly known as the purple leaf jatropha, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking purple foliage and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces capsule fruits containing toxic seeds, which are a defense mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden use, though care must be taken due to its toxic properties."
