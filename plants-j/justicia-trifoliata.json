    "intro": "Justicia trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaved joyweed, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces clusters of showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which attract pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often grown as an ornamental plant. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread through runners make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking vibrant, low-maintenance foliage."
