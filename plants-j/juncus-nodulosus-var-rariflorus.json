    "intro": "Juncus nodulosus var. rariflorus, commonly known as the rare-flowered rush, is a perennial plant native to certain regions of North America. It belongs to the Juncaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in late spring to early summer. This variant is distinguished by its reduced flowering compared to the typical form, making it a less common but ecologically significant species."
