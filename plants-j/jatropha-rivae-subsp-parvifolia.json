    "intro": "Jatropha rivae subsp. parvifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved physic nut, is a shrub native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange to red berries containing toxic seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Due to its toxic properties, it is not commonly cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
