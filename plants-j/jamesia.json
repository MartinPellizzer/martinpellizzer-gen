    "intro": "Jamesia, commonly known as the mountain snowbell, is a genus of flowering plants native to the western United States. It consists of only two species, Jamesia oreophila and Jamesia tremuloides, both of which are shrubs with showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plants typically grow in high-elevation environments, such as montane forests and rocky slopes. Their foliage is characterized by finely divided, fern-like leaves, and they produce white or pale yellow blossoms in the spring. Due to their limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Jamesia species are considered rare and are of interest to botanists and conservationists."
