    "intro": "Jurinea cartaliniana, commonly known as the Andean sandflower, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, succulent-like leaves. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils at high altitudes. Its small, yellowish flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, dry fruits known as achenes. Jurinea cartaliniana is adapted to withstand extreme conditions, including strong winds and temperature fluctuations."
