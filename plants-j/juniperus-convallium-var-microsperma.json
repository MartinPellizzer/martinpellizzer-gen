    "intro": "Juniperus convallium var. microsperma, commonly known as the dwarf juniper, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically reaches heights of less than 1 meter, with a dense, rounded form and needle-like leaves that are blue-gray in color. The plant produces small, scale-like leaves and male and female cones that are usually found on separate plants. It is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value. The variety microsperma is distinguished by its smaller seeds compared to other varieties of Juniperus convallium."
