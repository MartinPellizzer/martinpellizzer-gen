    "intro": "Jacobaea alpina subsp. alpina, commonly known as the alpine ragwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky, mountainous habitats and thrives in well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It produces small, elongated seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across high-altitude environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to cold, harsh climates."
