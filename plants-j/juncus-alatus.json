    "intro": "Juncus alatus, commonly known as the common rush, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its cylindrical, grass-like leaves that are often hairy or scaly, especially along the edges. The plant typically grows in moist or wet environments such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late spring to early summer, consist of small, greenish-brown flowers arranged in dense clusters. Juncus alatus plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
