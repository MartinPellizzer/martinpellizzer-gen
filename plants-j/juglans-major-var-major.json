    "intro": "Juglans major var. major, commonly known as the big walnut, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves and distinctive, edible nuts enclosed in a thick, woody husk. The tree produces male and female flowers on the same plant, with the female flowers developing into the characteristic walnut fruits. Its bark is rugged and fissured, often featuring a grayish-brown color. This species is valued for its timber and nuts, though it is also considered a potential invasive species in some regions."
