    "intro": "Jurinea chaetocarpa subsp. dshungarica, commonly known as the Tien Shan sandflower, is a flowering plant native to central Asia, particularly found in the Tien Shan mountain range. It is a low-growing perennial herb with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. Its root system is adapted to withstand drought, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitat."
