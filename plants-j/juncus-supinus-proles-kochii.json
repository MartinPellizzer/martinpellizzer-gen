    "intro": "Juncus supinus proles kochii, commonly known as the dwarf rush, is a flowering plant belonging to the Juncaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland ecosystems."
