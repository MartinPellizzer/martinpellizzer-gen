    "intro": "Justicia calcicola var. maestrensis, commonly known as the Maestrense Flameflower, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of Mexico. It thrives in well-drained soils, often found in rocky or limestone-rich environments. The plant produces striking clusters of bright red to orange tubular flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, making it suitable for xeriscaping in suitable climates."
