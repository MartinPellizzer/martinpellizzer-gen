    "intro": "Jurinea breviscapa, commonly known as the short-stemmed sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Europe. It is a perennial herb characterized by its compact growth habit and silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salty, windy environments. Jurinea breviscapa is often found in dunes and coastal cliffs, where it plays a role in stabilizing shorelines."
