    "intro": "Jouyella taltalensis, commonly known as the Taltal rock cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the coastal regions of northern Chile. It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, spiny structure adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found growing on rocky outcrops. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
