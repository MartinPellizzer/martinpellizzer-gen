    "intro": "Justicia ventricosa, commonly known as the balloon plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its swollen, balloon-like stems that store water, making it drought-tolerant. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are typically opposite and ovate, with a slightly hairy texture. Justicia ventricosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
