It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its unique, often spiny stems and reduced leaves. The plant produces showy, ephemeral flowers that open only at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Jaramilloa species are typically found in arid or semi-arid environments, adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions. Its botanical features make it an intriguing subject for ecological and horticultural study."
