    "intro": "Juniperus webbii, commonly known as the Tibetan juniper, is a species of juniper native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is a small evergreen shrub or tree that typically grows in rocky, arid environments. The plant has scale-like leaves that are closely arranged along the branches, and it produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Juniperus webbii is well adapted to cold climates and can thrive in poor soil conditions. Its resilience and unique morphology make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
