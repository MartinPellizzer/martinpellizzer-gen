    "intro": "Justicia careyana, commonly known as the red flame plant, is a striking tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It features vibrant red bracts that surround small, inconspicuous flowers, creating a dramatic visual effect. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture and a glossy surface. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and containers, though it can be invasive in some regions."
