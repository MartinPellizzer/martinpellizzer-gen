    "intro": "Jacaranda digitaliflora var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered jacaranda, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its feathery, digitate leaves and clusters of fragrant, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its ornamental value comes from its striking floral displays and the distinctive, showy seed pods that follow the flowers. The species is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
