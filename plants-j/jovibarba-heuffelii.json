    "intro": "Jovibarba heuffelii, commonly known as the Alpine stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid and rocky environments. The plant typically forms dense cushions or mats, which help it withstand harsh weather conditions. Its flowers are small, star-shaped, and usually pink or white, appearing in spring. Jovibarba heuffelii is valued in horticulture for its low maintenance and ability to add texture to rock gardens."
