    "intro": "Jurinea cataonica, commonly known as the Crimean sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the steppes of southern Ukraine and the Crimea. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and fleshy, helping to conserve moisture in its native habitat. Jurinea cataonica is often found in open, sun-exposed areas and is considered a characteristic species of steppe ecosystems."
