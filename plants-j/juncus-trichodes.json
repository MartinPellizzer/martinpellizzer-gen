    "intro": "Juncus trichodes, commonly known as the hairy rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in moist to submerged soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like stems that are densely covered with short, soft hairs, giving it its common name. Its flowering spikes appear in late summer, producing small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Juncus trichodes plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and wetland organisms."
