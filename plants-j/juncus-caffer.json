    "intro": "Juncus caffer, commonly known as the African rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often forming dense clumps near water bodies. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of white or pale green flowers. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Juncus caffer is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland habitats."
