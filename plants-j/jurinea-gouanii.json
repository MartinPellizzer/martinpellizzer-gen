    "intro": "Jurinea gouanii, commonly known as the desert sandflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It has small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adapted to the harsh, dry environments it inhabits. The plant features a compact rosette of fleshy, succulent leaves that help store water, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its root system is shallow but extensive, enabling it to quickly absorb moisture from brief rainfall events. Jurinea gouanii plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small desert organisms."
