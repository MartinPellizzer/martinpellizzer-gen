    "intro": "Jossinia heterophylla, commonly known as the variable-leaf jossinia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, which can range from ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and tropical landscapes."
