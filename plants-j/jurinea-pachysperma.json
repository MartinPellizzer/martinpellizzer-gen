    "intro": "Jurinea pachysperma, commonly known as the thick-seeded sea bladder, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and woolly, gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by thick, fleshy fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dunes and along shorelines. Its adaptations to coastal environments include salt tolerance and a low-growing habit to withstand strong winds."
