    "intro": "Jordania minuartoides, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically forms dense mats of small, succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Jordania minuartoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in difficult terrain."
