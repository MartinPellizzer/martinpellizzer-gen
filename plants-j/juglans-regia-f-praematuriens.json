    "intro": "Juglans regia f. praematuriens, commonly known as the early nut persimmon, is a botanical variant of the Persian walnut. It is characterized by its earlier ripening compared to the typical Juglans regia, making it valuable for commercial cultivation. The plant produces large, edible nuts with a thick, sweet pulp. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. This form is often cultivated for its high nut yield and unique flavor profile."
