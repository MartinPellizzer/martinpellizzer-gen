It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces striking, spatulate flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
