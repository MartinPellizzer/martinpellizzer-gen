    "intro": "Justicia protracta, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its clusters of small, sky-blue to white flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has slender, branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The showy inflorescences make it a popular choice for wetland restoration and ornamental gardening."
