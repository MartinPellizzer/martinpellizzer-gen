    "intro": "Jurinea longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in desert and semi-desert environments. The plant features slender, upright stems with small, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Jurinea longifolia is valued for its resilience to harsh conditions and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
