    "intro": "Juglans \u00d7 intermedia pyriformis, commonly known as the hybrid walnut, is a cross between the black walnut (Juglans nigra) and the English walnut (Juglans regia). It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, featuring a broad, spreading crown. The leaves are compound, with 5\u20139 pairs of lance-shaped leaflets, and they turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by edible nuts encased in a thick, husky shell. It is valued for its hardy nature and the high quality of its nuts, making it a popular choice for cultivation in temperate regions."
