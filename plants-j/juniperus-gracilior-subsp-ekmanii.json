    "intro": "Juniperus gracilior subsp. ekmanii, commonly known as the slender juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. This subspecies is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
