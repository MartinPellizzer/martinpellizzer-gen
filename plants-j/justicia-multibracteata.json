    "intro": "Justicia multibracteata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or red hot poker, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom in dense spikes, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through runners make it both a desirable and sometimes invasive species in certain regions."
