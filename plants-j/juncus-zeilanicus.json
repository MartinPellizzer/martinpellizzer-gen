    "intro": "Juncus zeilanicus, commonly known as the Zeilani rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, preferring moist soils and full sun to partial shade. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that are usually unbranched and covered in fine, grass-like leaves. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually green or brown and appear in clusters at the tips of the stems. Juncus zeilanicus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various organisms."
