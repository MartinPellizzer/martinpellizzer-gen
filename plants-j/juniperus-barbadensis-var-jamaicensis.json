It is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage and small, berry-like cones that mature to a dark blue or purple color. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to salty air and well-drained soils. It has a slow growth rate and can live for several decades. The leaves are aromatic, often used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent in local cuisines."
