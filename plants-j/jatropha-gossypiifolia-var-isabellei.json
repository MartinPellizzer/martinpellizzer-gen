    "intro": "Jatropha gossypiifolia var. isabellei, commonly known as the Isabelle's Crown of Thorns, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, fleshy stems and small, waxy leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by distinctive orange or red berries. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance. However, it can be invasive in some regions, posing a threat to local ecosystems."
