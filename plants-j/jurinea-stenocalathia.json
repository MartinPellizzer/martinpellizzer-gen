    "intro": "Jurinea stenocalathia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved jurinea, is a flowering plant native to the cold, arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble single blooms. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Jurinea stenocalathia is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can endure extreme temperature fluctuations."
