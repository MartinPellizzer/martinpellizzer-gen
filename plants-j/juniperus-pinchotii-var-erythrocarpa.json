It is characterized by its scale-like leaves and produces small, berry-like cones that are typically red when mature. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. It has a slow growth rate and is relatively drought-tolerant. The red berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife."
