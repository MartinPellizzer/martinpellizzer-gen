    "intro": "Juniperus recurva var. tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender juniper, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its prostrate or cascading growth habit, with thin, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are often used in landscaping for their ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its botanical features make it a hardy and drought-tolerant plant, well adapted to arid environments."
