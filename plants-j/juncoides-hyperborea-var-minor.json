It is a member of the Juncaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, clustered flowers. This plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils in tundra and alpine habitats. It has adapted to cold climates with a short growing season and is often found in open, wind-exposed areas. Its presence is an indicator of ecological health in polar and high-altitude environments."
