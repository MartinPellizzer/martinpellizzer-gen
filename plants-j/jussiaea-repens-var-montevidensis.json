    "intro": "Jussiaea repens var. montevidensis, commonly known as the creeping jussiaea, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South America. It typically thrives in wetland and marshy environments, where it forms dense mats on the soil surface. The plant has slender,\u530d\u5310\u7684 stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its small, opposite leaves are usually oval-shaped with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in spikes, contributing to its role in wetland ecosystems."
