    "intro": "Juniperus davurica var. mongolensis, commonly known as the Mongolian juniper, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub or small tree native to the cold climates of East Asia. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage and small, blue-gray berries that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in sandy or rocky soils and enduring extreme temperature fluctuations. Its cones, which mature over two years, are an important food source for wildlife. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in landscaping in colder regions."
