    "intro": "Juncus bufonius subsp. mutabilis, commonly known as the variable rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and tall, cylindrical spikelets that bear small, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands that provide habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms. Its leaves are narrow and cylindrical, with a smooth surface and a tendency to curl at the tips. The subspecies mutabilis is distinguished by its variable flowering patterns and subtle morphological differences compared to other subspecies of Juncus bufonius."
