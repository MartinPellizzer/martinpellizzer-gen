    "intro": "Jacquemontia tamnifolia, commonly known as the scarlet morning glory, is a herbaceous vine native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves and produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically bright red or orange. The plant blooms in the early morning, hence its common name, and has a climbing habit with tendrils that help it ascend support structures. Its flowers are pollinated by birds and insects, and the plant is adapted to moist, sunny habitats. Jacquemontia tamnifolia is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in rich, well-drained soils."
