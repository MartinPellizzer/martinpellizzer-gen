    "intro": "Jacksonia horrida var. tenuis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved swamp milkweed, is a perennial herb native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow to cream-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or swampy areas, thriving in moist, clay soils. It produces a milky sap that is a distinguishing feature of the genus Jacksonia. This variant is less hairy than the typical form, giving it a more delicate appearance."
