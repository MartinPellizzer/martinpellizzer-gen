    "intro": "Juno fosteriana, commonly known as the Foster's juniper, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cupressaceae. It is native to the western United States, particularly California and Oregon, where it grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and produces blue to purple berries that are edible for birds and small mammals. Juno fosteriana is often used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and attractive appearance. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and stabilizing soil in arid environments."
