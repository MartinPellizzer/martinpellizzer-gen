    "intro": "Juncus filiformis f. prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate rush, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant belonging to the Juncaceae family. It features slender, thread-like stems that lie flat on the ground, forming dense mats in moist or wet environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, greenish flowers. It is typically found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds or streams. Its adaptability to waterlogged soils makes it an important component of aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems."
