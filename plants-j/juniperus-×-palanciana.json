    "intro": "Juniperus \u00d7 palanciana, commonly known as the hybrid juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is a natural hybrid between Juniperus phoenicea and Juniperus oxycedrus, resulting in a plant with unique botanical characteristics. The plant typically has dense, scale-like leaves that are gray-green in color, and it produces small, blue-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as food for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Juniperus \u00d7 palanciana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
