    "intro": "Jupunba commutata, commonly known as the mountain saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with fleshy, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in a cluster, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in rocky or sandy soils. Jupunba commutata is often found in mountain meadows and is a hardy species that thrives in cold, high-altitude conditions."
