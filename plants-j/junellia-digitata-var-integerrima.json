    "intro": "Junellia digitata var. integerrima, commonly known as the velvetleaf morning glory, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of South America. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, blooming throughout the growing season. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a problematic weed in certain ecosystems."
