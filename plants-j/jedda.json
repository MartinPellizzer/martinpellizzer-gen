    "intro": "Jedda, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Australia. It belongs to the genus *Hesperaloe* and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from red to yellow. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. It typically blooms in late spring or early summer, adding vibrant color to the landscape. Jedda is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance."
