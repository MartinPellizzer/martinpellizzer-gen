    "intro": "Jurinea chia, commonly known as the chia plant, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped seeds that are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, fiber, and protein. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually pale blue or purple, and it produces a large number of tiny seeds that are widely used in food and traditional medicine. The plant's ability to survive in harsh conditions makes it an important resource in regions with limited agricultural potential."
