    "intro": "Juncus dioicus, commonly known as the common rush, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist or wet environments such as marshes, stream banks, and pond edges. It has separate male and female flowers, which are usually found on different plants, making it dioecious. The leaves are narrow, cylindrical, and often have a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss."
