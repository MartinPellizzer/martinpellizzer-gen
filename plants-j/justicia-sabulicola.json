    "intro": "Justicia sabulicola, commonly known as sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces clusters of showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It has lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, and it is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Justicia sabulicola is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
