    "intro": "Juno stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf junco, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale blue or purple flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators. Juno stenophylla is often found in rocky soils and is a hardy species that thrives in full sun."
