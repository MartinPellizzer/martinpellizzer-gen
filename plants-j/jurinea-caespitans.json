    "intro": "Jurinea caespitans, commonly known as the tufted sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in salty, windy conditions. Jurinea caespitans is an important plant for coastal stabilization and supports a variety of pollinators."
