    "intro": "Juglans salicifolia, commonly known as the willowleaf walnut, is a species of flowering plant in the Juglandaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of western North America, particularly in areas with moist, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its broad, willow-like leaves that are alternate and often have a serrated edge. Its fruit is a woody, two-valved capsule that contains one or two seeds. Juglans salicifolia is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage."
