    "intro": "Jovibarba hirta subsp. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous rock crasswolffia, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, providing structural support and reducing water loss. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, which bloom in early summer. This subspecies is often found growing on rocky substrates and is valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens."
