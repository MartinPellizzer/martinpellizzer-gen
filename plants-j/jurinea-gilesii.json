    "intro": "Jurinea gilesii, commonly known as the Giles' snowbell, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to cold, arid conditions. Its leaves are finely divided and often covered in a dense layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss.
