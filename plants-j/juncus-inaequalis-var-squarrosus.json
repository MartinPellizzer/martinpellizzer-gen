It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves that often have a reddish or brownish hue at the base. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early to mid-summer, typically arranged in spike-like clusters. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. This variety is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
