    "intro": "Jatropha tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf physic nut, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree with simple, alternate leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by spiny, three-lobed fruits containing toxic seeds. Jatropha tenuifolia is characterized by its latex sap, which is milky and can cause skin irritation. It is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental or for its potential in phytoremediation."
