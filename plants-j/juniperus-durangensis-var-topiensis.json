    "intro": "Juniperus durangensis var. topiensis, commonly known as the Topi\u00f1o juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Durango, Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, providing a striking visual contrast against its rugged habitat. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. This variety is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
