    "intro": "Juncus arcticus subsp. arcticus, commonly known as the arctic rush, is a perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environments and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats."
