    "intro": "Juncus ochrocoleus, commonly known as the yellow rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in late summer. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive colonies. Juncus ochrocoleus plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
