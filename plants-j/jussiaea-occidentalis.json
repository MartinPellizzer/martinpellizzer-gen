    "intro": "Jussiaea occidentalis, commonly known as the western jussiaea, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of western North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of lakes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in summer. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of wetland health."
