    "intro": "Juniperus recurva var. coxii, commonly known as the Coxi's creeping juniper, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the arid regions of western North America. It features dense, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, providing a striking visual contrast against its rugged habitat. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to harsh, desert-like environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid landscapes."
