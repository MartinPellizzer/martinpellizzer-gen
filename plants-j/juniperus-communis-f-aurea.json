    "intro": "Juniperus communis f. aurea, commonly known as the golden juniper, is a compact, slow-growing evergreen shrub or small tree with a distinctive golden-yellow foliage. Its leaves are scale-like and tightly pressed against the branches, giving it a dense, rounded appearance. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are typically harvested in late summer or early autumn. It is native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa, often found in rocky or sandy soils. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in landscaping for its hardiness and year-round color."
