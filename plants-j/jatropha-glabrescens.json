    "intro": "Jatropha glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth jatropha, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually smooth and glossy. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange-red berries containing toxic seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
