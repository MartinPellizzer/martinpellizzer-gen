It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss.
