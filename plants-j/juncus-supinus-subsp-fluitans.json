It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems that float on the surface of water bodies. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or brown in color. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its roots help stabilize sediment and provide habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
