    "intro": "Jussiaea oocarpa, commonly known as the Brazilian water lily, is a semi-aquatic plant native to South America. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and wetlands. The plant has broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a distinctive, showy appearance. Jussiaea oocarpa plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
