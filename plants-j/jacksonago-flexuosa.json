It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a suitable choice for xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often used in native plant gardens."
