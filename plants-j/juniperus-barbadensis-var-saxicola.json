    "intro": "Juniperus barbadensis var. saxicola, commonly known as the rock juniper, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage and small, berry-like cones that mature to a dark blue color. The plant is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in coastal or mountainous regions. Its slow growth rate and ability to thrive in harsh environments make it a hardy ornamental plant. The leaves are typically aromatic and can be used in traditional medicine or as a source of essential oils."
