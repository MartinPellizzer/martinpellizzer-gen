    "intro": "Justicia breviflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved false arum, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking, spatulate-shaped leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that are often brightly colored. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant produces berries that are dispersed by animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments."
