    "intro": "Jasminum humile f. pubigerum, commonly known as the pubescent jasmine, is a compact shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often emitting a sweet, intoxicating aroma. The plant features opposite, simple, and hairy leaves that give it its \"pubigerum\" designation, meaning \"covered with hair.\" It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its pleasant fragrance and compact growth habit. This variety is closely related to other jasmine species but is distinguished by its dense pubescence and smaller floral size."
