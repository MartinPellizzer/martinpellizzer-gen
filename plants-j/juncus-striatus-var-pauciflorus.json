    "intro": "Juncus striatus var. pauciflorus, commonly known as the narrowleaf rush, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and spikes of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is distinguished by its reduced flower number compared to the typical form of Juncus striatus."
