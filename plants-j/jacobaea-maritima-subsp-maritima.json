    "intro": "Jacobaea maritima subsp. maritima, commonly known as sea ragwort, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky coastal habitats, where it thrives in saline and well-drained soils. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom from late summer to early autumn. Sea ragwort is often found in dunes and cliffs, playing a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
