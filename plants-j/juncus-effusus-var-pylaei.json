    "intro": "Juncus effusus var. pylaei, commonly known as the Pylaean rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features tall, cylindrical stems that are often reddish-brown in color, growing up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in spike-like inflorescences, which bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist soils. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wetland wildlife."
