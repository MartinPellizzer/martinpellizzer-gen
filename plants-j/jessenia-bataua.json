    "intro": "Jessenia bataua, commonly known as the bataua tree, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in countries like Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. It belongs to the Moraceae family, which includes figs and mulberries, and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The tree produces small, clustered flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are an important food source for both wildlife and humans. Its wood is valued for its strength and durability, making it useful in construction and furniture-making."
