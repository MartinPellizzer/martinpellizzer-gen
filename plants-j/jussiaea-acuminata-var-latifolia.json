    "intro": "Jussiaea acuminata var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in South America. It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted for aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in still or slow-moving water. The leaves are typically covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss and provides protection against aquatic pests."
