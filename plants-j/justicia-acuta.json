    "intro": "Justicia acuta, commonly known as the acuteleaf false arum, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that resemble flowers but are actually clusters of small, clustered flowers. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to partially shaded environments. Justicia acuta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral displays."
