    "intro": "Jatropha pauciflora subsp. pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered common jatropha, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and elliptical leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds covered in a sticky, toxic substance. This species is notable for its adaptability to poor soil conditions and its role in local ecosystems."
