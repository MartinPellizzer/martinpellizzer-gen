    "intro": "Jonquilla juncifolia, commonly known as the swamp lily, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, thriving in moist, sandy soils. It is often found in riverine forests and wetlands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it requires consistent moisture to flourish."
