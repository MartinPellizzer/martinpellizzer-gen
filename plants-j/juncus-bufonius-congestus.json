    "intro": "Juncus bufonius congestus, commonly known as the clustered rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves that form a compact rosette. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil make it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
