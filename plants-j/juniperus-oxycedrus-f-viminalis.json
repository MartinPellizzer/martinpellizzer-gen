    "intro": "Juniperus oxycedrus f. viminalis, commonly known as the European juniper or creeping juniper, is a subspecies of the juniper shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions."
