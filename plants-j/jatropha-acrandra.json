    "intro": "Jatropha acrandra, commonly known as the largeleaf spurge, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and striking yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces capsules that contain toxic seeds, which are a defense mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in disturbed soils or open woodlands. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though caution is advised due to its toxic properties."
