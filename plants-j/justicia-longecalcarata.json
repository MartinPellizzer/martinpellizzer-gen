    "intro": "Justicia longecalcarata, commonly known as the long-spurred justicia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their shape and nectar-rich structure. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
