    "intro": "Juglans major f. stellata, commonly known as the star-shaped walnut, is a botanical variant of the Persian walnut. It is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped leaves, which are typically divided into five to seven segments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are followed by round, green fruits encased in a thick, inedible husk. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas with well-drained soil. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and its potential use in horticulture and forestry."
