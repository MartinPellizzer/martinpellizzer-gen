    "intro": "Juncus balticus var. crassiculmis, commonly known as the Baltic rush, is a perennial plant native to the wetlands of northern Europe. It features dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and somewhat succulent. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are arranged in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along riverbanks. This variety is notable for its robust growth and ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
