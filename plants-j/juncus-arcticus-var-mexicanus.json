It is a member of the Juncaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in spike-like clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a ornamental plant in dry landscapes."
