    "intro": "Jussiaea repens f. typica, commonly known as the creeping jussiaea, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped and have a slightly waxy texture, adapted to retain moisture in water-saturated soils. Jussiaea repens f. typica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
