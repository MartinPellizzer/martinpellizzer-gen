    "intro": "Juncus bufonius var. genuinus, commonly known as the frog moss or marsh rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, greenish flowers in spikes during the summer months. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. It is also valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to filter water and support biodiversity."
