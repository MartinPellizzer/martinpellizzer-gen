    "intro": "Juniperus horizontalis f. plumosa, commonly known as the creeping juniper or creeping snowball juniper, is a low-growing, ornamental shrub native to the eastern United States. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with needle-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are typically blue or purple, adding visual interest in the winter months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its compact growth habit and hardy nature make it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
