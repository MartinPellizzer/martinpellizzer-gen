    "intro": "Juncus alpinus subsp. turczaninowii, commonly known as the alpine rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features slender, cylindrical stems that are usually green or reddish in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are grass-like, narrow, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
