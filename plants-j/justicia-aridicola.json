    "intro": "Justicia aridicola, commonly known as the desert flame or desert justicia, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Mexico and Central America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky soils and dry environments. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which attract pollinators like bees and birds. Its leaves are usually small, narrow, and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Justicia aridicola is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
