    "intro": "Jasione sessiliflora subsp. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers during the spring and summer months. Its subspecies status reflects subtle differences in morphology, particularly in the density and texture of its pubescent leaves. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands."
