    "intro": "Jurinea delitescens, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh, cold environments and thrives in rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are usually covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps to reduce water loss. Jurinea delitescens is known for its ephemeral blooming period, often appearing briefly during the short summer months."
