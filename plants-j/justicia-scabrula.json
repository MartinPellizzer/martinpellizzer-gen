    "intro": "Justicia scabrula, commonly known as roughleaf false dragonhead, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces spikes of small, tubular flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
