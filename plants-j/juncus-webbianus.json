    "intro": "Juncus webbianus, commonly known as the webb's rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland habitats. Juncus webbianus plays an important ecological role in supporting aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
