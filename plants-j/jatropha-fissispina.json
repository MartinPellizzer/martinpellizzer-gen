    "intro": "Jatropha fissispina, commonly known as the fissured spiny jatropha, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its spiny stems and leaves with a distinctive, fissured appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing toxic seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
