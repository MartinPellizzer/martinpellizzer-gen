    "intro": "Justicia ilhensis, commonly known as the Ilhensian jewelweed, is a flowering plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or along stream banks. It features opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its stems are often branched and creeping. The flowers are primarily pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure and bright coloration."
