    "intro": "Jurinea kitanovii, commonly known as the Kitanov's sea bladder, is a halophytic plant native to the coastal regions of the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. It thrives in saline and alkaline environments, often found in dunes and salt marshes. The plant has a low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that help it retain water in arid conditions. Its flowers are small and typically pale yellow, appearing in clusters during the summer months. Jurinea kitanovii plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and is adapted to withstand strong winds and salt spray."
