    "intro": "Juniperus uhdeana, commonly known as the Uhde juniper, is a species of juniper native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree, typically reaching heights of up to 5 meters. The plant has scale-like leaves that are closely arranged along the branches, giving it a dense, compact appearance. Its cones, which are typically blue or purple in color, are an important feature for identification. Juniperus uhdeana is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments."
