It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, sandy soils within pine flatwoods and wetlands. The plant features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in the early morning. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine, hairy textures, while its vines can climb or trail along the ground. Jacquemontia pinetorum plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain wildlife."
