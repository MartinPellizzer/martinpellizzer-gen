    "intro": "Juniperus polycarpos var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping juniper, is a deciduous conifer native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its cascading, drooping branches that create a distinctive, fountain-like shape. The plant produces small, scale-like leaves that turn a coppery red in the fall before shedding. Its cones are small and berry-like, containing toxic seeds that are not suitable for human consumption. This variety thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens."
