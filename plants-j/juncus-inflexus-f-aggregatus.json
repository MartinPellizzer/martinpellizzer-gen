    "intro": "Juncus inflexus f. aggregatus, commonly known as the clustered rush, is a variant of the common rush species native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its dense,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit, with multiple stems arising from a single base. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and somewhat hairy. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters at the tips of its stems. This form is often found in marshy areas and is valued for its ability to stabilize soil in wetland ecosystems."
