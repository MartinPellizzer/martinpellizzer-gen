    "intro": "Jussiaea repens var. glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth trailing jussiaea, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in the Americas. It features slender, spreading stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats over the soil surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptical, and often covered with fine hairs, though the varietal name \"glaberrima\" suggests a notably smooth or hairless appearance. This species is adapted to moist, nutrient-poor soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
