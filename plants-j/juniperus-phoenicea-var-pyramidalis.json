It features a narrow, conical shape with dense, scale-like leaves that are dark green and often have a bluish tint. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are typically blue or black when mature, containing toxic seeds. It is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soil. This variety is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
