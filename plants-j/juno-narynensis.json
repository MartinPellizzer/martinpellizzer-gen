    "intro": "Juno narynensis, commonly known as the Karakoram juniper, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Karakoram and surrounding mountain ranges. It is a small evergreen shrub or tree that typically grows at elevations above 3,000 meters. The plant has needle-like leaves that are dark green and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its compact growth form and ability to thrive in extreme conditions make it an important component of alpine ecosystems. Juno narynensis is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
