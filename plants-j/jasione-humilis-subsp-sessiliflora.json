The plant typically blooms from spring to early summer, producing numerous tiny flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable component of Mediterranean flora and a subject of interest in ecological studies."
