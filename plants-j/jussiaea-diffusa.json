    "intro": "Jussiaea diffusa, commonly known as the floating bladderwort, is a water-dwelling plant native to freshwater environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are often inflated, resembling bladders, which help it remain buoyant. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow, adapted for aquatic pollination. Its roots are short and non-woody, allowing it to anchor in muddy or sandy substrates. Jussiaea diffusa plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
