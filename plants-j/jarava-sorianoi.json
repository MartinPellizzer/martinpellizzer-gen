    "intro": "Jarava sorianoi, commonly known as the Sierra Valley jarava, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly California. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a species of concern in some regions."
