It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, which is a distinctive botanical feature.
