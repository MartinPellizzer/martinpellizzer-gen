    "intro": "Justicia alboviridis, commonly known as the white-veined jewelweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often with contrasting green veins. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, and features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure and bright coloration. The plant is often found in moist, shady environments such as forest floors or along stream banks."
