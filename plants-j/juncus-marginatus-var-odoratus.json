    "intro": "Juncus marginatus var. odoratus, commonly known as the fragrant rush, is a perennial plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Juncaceae family and is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems that often grow in wet or marshy environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green or reddish in color. It is notable for its subtle, aromatic scent, which is more pronounced in certain varieties. Due to its adaptability and ornamental qualities, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland gardens or as a water garden plant."
