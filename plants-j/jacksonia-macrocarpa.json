    "intro": "Jacksonia macrocarpa, commonly known as the New Zealand dandelion, is a perennial herb native to New Zealand. It features a basal rosette of broadly ovate, silver-green leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that open in late spring to early summer. Its flower heads are surrounded by bracts that resemble petals, giving it a dandelion-like appearance. Jacksonia macrocarpa is often found in damp, shaded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
