    "intro": "Juniperus sabina var. prostrata, commonly known as creeping juniper, is a low-growing shrub native to rocky and arid regions of Europe and Asia. It features dense, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, providing a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans and animals. It is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental value and ecological benefits in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
