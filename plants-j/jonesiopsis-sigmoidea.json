    "intro": "Jonesiopsis sigmoidea, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a unique fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in humid conditions. Jonesiopsis sigmoidea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
