    "intro": "Justicia guerkeana, commonly known as the Guerke's flame flower, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a glossy surface, while its stems are often covered in fine hairs. The flowers are pollinated by birds, especially hummingbirds, due to their bright colors and nectar-rich structure."
