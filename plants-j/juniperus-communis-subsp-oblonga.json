    "intro": "Juniperus communis subsp. oblonga, commonly known as the common juniper, is a subspecies of the juniper shrub native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, consisting of scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. This subspecies is widely used in landscaping and has historical uses in medicine and as a spice."
