    "intro": "Juncus indicus var. nanus, commonly known as dwarf rush, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It features dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 30 cm in height. The plant produces small, greenish-brown flowers in spikes during the summer months. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, pond margins, and along stream banks. Due to its compact size and adaptability, it is a valuable plant for stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
