It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in sunny environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central dark center. Jacobaea tenuifolia is often found in grasslands and along coastal areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local insect populations."
