    "intro": "Jurinea sordida, commonly known as the dirty sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal dunes and dry grasslands. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically pale yellow or greenish-white, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. Jurinea sordida is well adapted to harsh environments, showcasing resilience through its specialized morphology and efficient water conservation strategies."
