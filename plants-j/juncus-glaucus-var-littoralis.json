    "intro": "Juncus glaucus var. littoralis, commonly known as saltmarsh rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences. This variety thrives in saline or brackish wetlands, often found in tidal zones and estuaries. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in coastal environments. The plant plays an important role in the ecological balance of salt marsh ecosystems."
