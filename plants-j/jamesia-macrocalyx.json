    "intro": "Jamesia macrocalyx, commonly known as the mountain snowbrush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are gray-green in color and covered in a powdery coating. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in subalpine and alpine environments. Its botanical features make it well adapted to cold, high-altitude climates."
