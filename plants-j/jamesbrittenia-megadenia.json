    "intro": "Jamesbrittenia megadenia, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 20 centimeters in diameter, often displaying vibrant colors such as purple and yellow. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
