It is characterized by its compound leaves with three distinct lobes and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces distinctive, spiny fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems, supporting various insect and bird populations."
