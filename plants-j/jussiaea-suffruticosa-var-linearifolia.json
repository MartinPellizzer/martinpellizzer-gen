The plant features small, white to pale pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its leaves are narrow and linear, giving it its common name. It is adapted to moist environments and can tolerate periodic flooding. The species is of interest in botanical studies due to its ecological role and potential medicinal properties."
