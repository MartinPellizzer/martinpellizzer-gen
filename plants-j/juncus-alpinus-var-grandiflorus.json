It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical inflorescence that bears numerous small, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in wet, rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes. Its leaves are grass-like and often form dense clumps, contributing to its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
