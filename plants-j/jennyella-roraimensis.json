    "intro": "Jennyella roraimensis, commonly known as the Roraima Jennyella, is a rare flowering plant native to the tepuis of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique, palmate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in the nutrient-poor, acidic soils of the highland plateaus, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions. It is typically found in shaded, moist habitats and is considered an endemic species to the region. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
