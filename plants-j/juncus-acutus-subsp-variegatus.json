    "intro": "Juncus acutus subsp. variegatus, commonly known as the variegated rush, is a perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features grass-like, cylindrical leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish or brownish flowers during the summer months. It thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and damp woodlands. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to tolerate waterlogged soil."
