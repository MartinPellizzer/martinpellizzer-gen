    "intro": "Jagera glabra, commonly known as the smooth jagera, is a small evergreen shrub native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are smooth and glossy, often arranged in whorls along the stems. The plant produces small, pale green or yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its fruits are small, woody capsules that split open to release seeds. Jagera glabra is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
