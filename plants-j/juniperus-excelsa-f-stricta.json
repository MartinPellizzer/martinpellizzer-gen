    "intro": "Juniperus excelsa f. stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved juniper, is a compact, shrub-like form of the broadleaf juniper. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more rigid than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in suitable climates."
