    "intro": "Juniperus compacta, commonly known as the dwarf juniper, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It has scale-like leaves that are tightly pressed against the stems, giving it a dense, rounded appearance. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soil and extreme temperatures. Juniperus compacta is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value."
