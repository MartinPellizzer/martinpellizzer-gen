    "intro": "Jasione montana var. maritima, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and spiny, silvery leaves that help reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and coastal cliffs. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in coastal landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value. Jasione montana var. maritima is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
