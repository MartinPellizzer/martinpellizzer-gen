    "intro": "Juncus trifidus var. fastigiatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf rush, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, often appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils, making it a common inhabitant of marshes, stream banks, and other wetland habitats. Due to its upright growth habit and dense foliage, it is often used in ornamental landscaping for erosion control and water feature decoration."
