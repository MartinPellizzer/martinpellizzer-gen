    "intro": "Juniperus arborescens, commonly known as the creeping juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing form with scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Juniperus arborescens is valued for its ornamental use in landscaping due to its hardy nature and evergreen foliage."
