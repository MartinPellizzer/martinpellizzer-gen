    "intro": "Juncus glaucus f. virescens, commonly known as the greenish rush, is a variant of the common rush species characterized by its predominantly green foliage. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, wet meadows, and along stream banks. The plant forms dense clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often used in landscaping for their ornamental appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender spikes. The subspecies is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in waterlogged soils, making it a useful plant for erosion control."
