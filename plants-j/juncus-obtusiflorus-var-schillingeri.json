    "intro": "Juncus obtusiflorus var. schillingeri, commonly known as Schillinger's bulrush, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces dense clusters of small, pale green to brownish flowers at the top of the stems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in shallow water or moist soil. This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
