    "intro": "Justicia lupulina, commonly known as the yellow wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in forest understories. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a slightly sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. Justicia lupulina is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
