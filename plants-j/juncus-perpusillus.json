    "intro": "Juncus perpusillus, commonly known as the dwarf rush, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features slender, grass-like stems that typically reach heights of less than 10 centimeters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters near the base of the stems, which are pollinated by wind. Its roots form dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland environments. Juncus perpusillus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils."
