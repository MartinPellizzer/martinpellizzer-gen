    "intro": "Janipha manihot, commonly known as cassava, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is an herbaceous perennial that produces large, heart-shaped leaves and woody stems. The plant's underground roots, or tubers, are its primary economic product and are used as a staple food source in many countries. Cassava is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its high yield per hectare. Its botanical features make it an important crop in both subsistence and commercial agriculture."
