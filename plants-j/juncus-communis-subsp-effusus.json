    "intro": "Juncus communis subsp. effusus, commonly known as the soft rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often reddish or brownish in color, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes during the summer months. Its leaves are grass-like and usually shorter than the stems, contributing to its overall dense, tufted appearance. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
