    "intro": "Johnsonia inconspicua, commonly known as the inconspicuous johnsonia, is a flowering plant native to the humid lowland forests of western Africa. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes many ornamental and economically important plants. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a rough texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
