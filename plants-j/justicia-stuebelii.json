It is characterized by its vibrant red or orange tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. Its flowering period occurs during the warmer months, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
