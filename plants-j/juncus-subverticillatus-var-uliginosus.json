    "intro": "Juncus subverticillatus var. uliginosus, commonly known as the bog rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features tall, slender cylindrical stems that often grow in dense clusters, typically reaching heights of 1 to 3 meters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters at the top of the stems, which are usually greenish or brownish in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and they are adapted to thrive in moist, often waterlogged soils. This variety is particularly suited to swampy areas and is often found in association with other wetland plants."
