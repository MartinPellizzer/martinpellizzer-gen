    "intro": "Juglans sieboldiana var. cordiformis, commonly known as the Japanese white walnut, is a deciduous tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically 10\u201320 cm in length and have a serrated margin. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by round, green fruits that mature into brown, woody nuts. Its bark is thick, furrowed, and dark brown, while the wood is prized for its strength and fine grain. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for its edible nuts."
