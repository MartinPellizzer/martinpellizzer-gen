It typically grows in wetland environments, including swampy areas and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils and is often found in coastal and inland wetlands. This subspecies plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
