    "intro": "Juncus complanatus, commonly known as flatleaf rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It typically grows in dense clusters, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with slender, cylindrical stems that are often used in basket weaving. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in early summer, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are flat and grass-like, often forming a dense mat that helps stabilize soil in wet environments. Juncus complanatus plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and wetland organisms."
