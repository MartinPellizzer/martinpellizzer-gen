It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. The plant features slender stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are bell-shaped, usually blue or violet, and bloom in summer. Jacea nemoralis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
