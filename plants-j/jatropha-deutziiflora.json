    "intro": "Jatropha deutziiflora, commonly known as the dwarf physic nut, is a species of flowering plant in the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its small, yellowish-green flowers and oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain toxic seeds, which are not suitable for human consumption. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its ornamental value and potential for use in biofuel production, it has been cultivated in some parts of the world."
