    "intro": "Justicia glabra, commonly known as whiteleaf flamebeard, is a herbaceous plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in clusters, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Justicia glabra is also known for its ability to tolerate drought conditions once established."
