    "intro": "Jatropha rivae subsp. quercifolia, commonly known as the oak-leaved jatropha, is a shrub native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which resemble the shape of oak leaves, and its clusters of yellow flowers. The plant produces small, greenish-black berries that contain toxic seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its ornamental value and potential for use in ecological restoration, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
