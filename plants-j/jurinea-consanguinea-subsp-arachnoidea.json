    "intro": "Jurinea consanguinea subsp. arachnoidea, commonly known as the spider-hair jurinea, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a distinctive, woolly appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This subspecies is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in steppe and desert habitats."
