    "intro": "Juncus alpinus, commonly known as alpine rush, is a perennial plant native to mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and spike-like inflorescence that bears small, greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in harsh, rocky environments. Juncus alpinus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
