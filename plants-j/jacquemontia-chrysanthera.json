    "intro": "Jacquemontia chrysanthera, commonly known as the yellow false nettle, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces showy yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it grows in moist, rich soils along stream banks and in wetlands. It is part of the Convolvulaceae family, which includes morning glories, and is characterized by its twining stems and tubular flowers. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for pollinators."
