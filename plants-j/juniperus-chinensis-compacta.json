    "intro": "Juniperus chinensis compacta, commonly known as the Chinese juniper or dwarf Chinese juniper, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to China. It features small, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, providing a dense, ornamental appearance. The plant produces blue-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. It is highly adaptable, thriving in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade. Due to its slow growth and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and as a foundation plant in landscaping."
