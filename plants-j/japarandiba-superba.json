    "intro": "Japarandiba superba, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood with a rich, oily texture, making it highly valued in the musical instrument industry. The plant has large, palmately compound leaves that are typically green and glossy. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by dark blue berries. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
