    "intro": "Juniperus communis subsp. nipponica, commonly known as Japanese juniper, is a subspecies of the common juniper native to East Asia. It is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree with needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in horticulture."
