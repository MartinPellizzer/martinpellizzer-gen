    "intro": "Jasione sessiliflora var. canescens, commonly known as the grey-leaved jasmine weed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial with narrow, greyish-green leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a weed in some regions but also has ornamental value."
