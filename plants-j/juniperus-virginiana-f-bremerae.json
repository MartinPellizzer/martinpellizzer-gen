    "intro": "Juniperus virginiana f. bremerae, commonly known as the Bremer's red cedar, is a rare and distinctive form of the Eastern red cedar. It is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit and smaller, more rounded leaves compared to the typical form. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are a key feature of its reproductive cycle. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or open woodland habitats. This form is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
