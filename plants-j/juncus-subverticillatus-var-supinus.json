    "intro": "Juncus subverticillatus var. supinus, commonly known as the upturned rush, is a perennial plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves that are typically erect and slightly curved upwards. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet environments such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
