    "intro": "Jussiaea distans, commonly known as the narrow-leaved waterplantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often submerged or floating, with small, green flowers that bloom in late summer. Its root system helps stabilize soil and improve water quality by filtering sediments. Jussiaea distans plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
