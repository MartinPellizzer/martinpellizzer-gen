    "intro": "Juncus articulatus subsp. striatus, commonly known as the striped rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, ditches, and the edges of ponds. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that are often striped with distinct longitudinal markings. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers in late summer. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates."
