    "intro": "Jurinea korotkovae, commonly known as the Korotkov's ice plant, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure adapted to harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers during the short growing season, and its leaves are typically succulent to store water. Jurinea korotkovae thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms in its extreme environment."
