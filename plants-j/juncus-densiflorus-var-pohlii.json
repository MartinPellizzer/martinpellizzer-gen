    "intro": "Juncus densiflorus var. pohlii, commonly known as the denseflower rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that often grow in dense clusters, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This variety is adapted to moist soils and is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of water bodies."
