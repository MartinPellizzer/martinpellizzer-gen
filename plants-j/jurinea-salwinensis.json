    "intro": "Jurinea salwinensis, commonly known as the Salwin's sea bladder, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is adapted to cold, arid environments and often grows in rocky or gravelly soils. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Jurinea salwinensis is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas."
