    "intro": "Julocroton lithrifolius, commonly known as the rockleaf croton, is a perennial shrub native to the rocky regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are noted for their distinctive, crinkled texture and ability to retain moisture, adapting to arid environments. Julocroton lithrifolius is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
