It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wetland and aquatic environments. The plant has small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Jussiaea fluviatilis is adapted to fluctuating water levels and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks."
