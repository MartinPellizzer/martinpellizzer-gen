    "intro": "Juncus zebrinus, commonly known as the zebra rush, is a perennial wetland plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are often striped with alternating light and dark green bands, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, thriving in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, consist of small, clustered flowers that are pale green to brown in color. Juncus zebrinus plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
