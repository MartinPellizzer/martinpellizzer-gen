    "intro": "Juglans \u00d7 notha nothovar. batesii, commonly known as the Black walnut hybrid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Juglans nigra and Juglans regia. It exhibits characteristics of both parent species, with a robust growth habit and large, edible nuts. The plant is valued for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. Its leaves are compound, with a serrated margin, and it produces a distinctive, fragrant compound fruit. This hybrid is often cultivated for its nuts and timber, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
