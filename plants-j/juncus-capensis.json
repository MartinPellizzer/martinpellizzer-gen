    "intro": "Juncus capensis, commonly known as the Cape rush, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Juncaceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of grass-like leaves and spikes of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or damp environments such as marshes, stream banks, and coastal areas. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Juncus capensis is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive, upright growth habit and ability to thrive in moist conditions."
