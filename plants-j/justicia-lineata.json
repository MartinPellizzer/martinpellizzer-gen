    "intro": "Justicia lineata, commonly known as the Mexican flamebush, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and Central America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking clusters of red, tubular flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their color and nectar-rich structure. Justicia lineata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types."
