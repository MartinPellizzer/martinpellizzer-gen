    "intro": "Juncus rostkovii, commonly known as the Rostkov's rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, ditches, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is often found in disturbed or nutrient-rich soils and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade. Juncus rostkovii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
