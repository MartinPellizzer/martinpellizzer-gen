    "intro": "Jasione crispa subsp. serpentinica, commonly known as the serpentine jasione, is a flowering plant native to rocky, nutrient-poor soils of the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant has a low-growing habit with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves adapted to harsh, dry environments. It thrives in serpentine soils, which are rich in magnesium and poor in calcium, making it a rare example of a plant specialized to such conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
