    "intro": "Jurinea dshungarica, commonly known as the Mongolian sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy stems and small, pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in desert and semi-desert environments. It has adapted to extreme conditions with a deep root system and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss. Jurinea dshungarica plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is of interest in ecological restoration projects."
