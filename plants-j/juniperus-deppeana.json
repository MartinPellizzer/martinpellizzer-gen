    "intro": "Juniperus deppeana, commonly known as the Mexican redcedar, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves that are typically reddish-brown in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife species. Juniperus deppeana thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of the ecosystems in its native range."
