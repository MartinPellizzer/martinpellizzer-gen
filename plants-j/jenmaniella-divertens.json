It is characterized by its helical growth pattern, where the stem twists around supporting structures in a spiral manner. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a rough texture. Jenmaniella divertens is valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
