    "intro": "Justicia procumbens, commonly known as the creeping justicia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features spreading stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces clusters of showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Justicia procumbens thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
