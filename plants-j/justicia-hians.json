    "intro": "Justicia hians, commonly known as the red-veined or pink-flowered justicia, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, often with contrasting veining, which attract pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a reddish or purple underside, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Justicia hians thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
