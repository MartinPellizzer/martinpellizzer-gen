    "intro": "Justicia saltensis, commonly known as saltbush or coastal saltbush, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. It thrives in saline soils and is often found in coastal dunes or salt marshes. Justicia saltensis is well adapted to withstand high salinity and extreme temperature fluctuations."
