    "intro": "Justicia thyrsoidea, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces clusters of blue to purple flowers, which are borne on long, slender inflorescences. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its showy blooms and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
