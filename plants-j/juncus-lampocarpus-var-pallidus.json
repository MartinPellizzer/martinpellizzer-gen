    "intro": "Juncus lampocarpus var. pallidus, commonly known as the pale rush, is a perennial plant native to coastal areas of southern California. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems that grow in dense clusters, often reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are typically arranged in clusters along the stem. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure. This variety is often found in dunes and tidal wetlands, playing a role in stabilizing coastal environments."
