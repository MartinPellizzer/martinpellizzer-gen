It features dense, compact foliage composed of small, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spherical blue berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and as a decorative hedge. Its hardy nature and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice in horticulture."
