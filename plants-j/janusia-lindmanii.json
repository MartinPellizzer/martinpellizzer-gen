    "intro": "Janusia lindmanii, commonly known as the Lindman's cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with reduced leaves and a thick cuticle to minimize water loss. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening in the morning and closing by midday. Janusia lindmanii is often found in rocky soils and is a relatively rare species in its native range."
