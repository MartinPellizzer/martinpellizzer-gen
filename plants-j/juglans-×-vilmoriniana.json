    "intro": "Juglans \u00d7 vilmoriniana, commonly known as the Vilmorin walnut, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Juglans regia (Persian walnut) and Juglans mandshurica (Manchurian walnut). It is characterized by its large, robust nuts with thick, husks that split open to reveal the edible kernels. The tree is a medium to large deciduous tree, typically reaching heights of 10\u201320 meters, with a broad, spreading crown. Its leaves are compound, with 15\u201323 lance-shaped leaflets, and it produces yellowish-green flowers in catkins. The Vilmorin walnut is valued for its hardy nature and the quality of its nuts, making it a popular choice for cultivation in temperate climates."
