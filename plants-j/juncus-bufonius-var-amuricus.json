    "intro": "Juncus bufonius var. amuricus, commonly known as the Amur rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to water-saturated soils. The plant features tall, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming dense clumps that help stabilize soil in its wetland habitats. The Amur rush plays an important ecological role in filtering water and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
