It is characterized by its striking silver-green leaves with prominent veins, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
