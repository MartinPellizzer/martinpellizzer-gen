    "intro": "Jenkinsia, commonly known as the Jenkinsia tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plants typically grow as shrubs or small trees, characterized by their compound leaves and legume-like pods. Jenkinsia species are often found in open woodland or savanna habitats, where they contribute to local biodiversity. Their flowers are usually small and clustered, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
