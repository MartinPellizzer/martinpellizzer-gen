    "intro": "Jovellana, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Jovellana thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in cloud forests and high-altitude environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation in temperate climates."
