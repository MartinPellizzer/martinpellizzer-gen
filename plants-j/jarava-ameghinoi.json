    "intro": "Jarava ameghinoi, commonly known as the Andean jarava, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature and ecological significance, it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
