    "intro": "Juniperus nana var. alpina, commonly known as the Alpine dwarf juniper, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically reaches heights of only a few inches, forming dense, cushion-like growth patterns that help it survive in harsh alpine conditions. The plant produces small, scale-like leaves that are dark green and retain their color year-round, providing evergreen cover in high-altitude environments. Its berries, which are blue-black and toxic to humans, are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. This hardy species is well adapted to cold climates and poor soils, making it a common sight in rocky and barren alpine landscapes."
