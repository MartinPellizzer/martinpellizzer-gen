    "intro": "Jacaranda arborea, commonly known as the blue jacaranda, is a deciduous tree native to South America. It is characterized by its striking clusters of violet-blue flowers that bloom in the spring. The tree has a broad, spreading canopy and exudes a fragrant scent when in bloom. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments. The wood is hard and durable, making it valuable for construction and furniture."
