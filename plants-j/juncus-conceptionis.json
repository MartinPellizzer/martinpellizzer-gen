    "intro": "Juncus conceptionis, commonly known as the conception grass, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and wet meadows. The plant produces tall, cylindrical spikes of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Its slender, grass-like leaves are arranged in dense clusters at the base. Juncus conceptionis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
