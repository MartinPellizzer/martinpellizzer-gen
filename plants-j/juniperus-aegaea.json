    "intro": "Juniperus aegaea, commonly known as the Aegean juniper, is a species of juniper native to the Mediterranean region. It is a small evergreen shrub or tree that typically grows in rocky or coastal areas. The plant has scale-like leaves that are often blue-gray in color, and it produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Juniperus aegaea is known for its aromatic foliage and is often used in traditional medicine. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
