    "intro": "Jovibarba globifera subsp. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous cushion plant, is a succulent species native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps and the Pyrenees. It is characterized by its dense, compact rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in a terminal inflorescence. It is well adapted to cold, arid environments and can survive harsh winter conditions due to its thick, water-storing leaves. This subspecies is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in full sun exposure."
