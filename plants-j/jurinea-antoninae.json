    "intro": "Jurinea antoninae, commonly known as the Antonina's sea bladder, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its succulent, bladder-like structures that store water. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shorelines, adapting to saline and arid conditions. Its flowers are small and pink, often clustered in inflorescences that bloom during the spring. Due to its habitat, it plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
