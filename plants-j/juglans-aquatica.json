    "intro": "Juglans aquatica, commonly known as the water hickory, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 10 to 20 inches long and composed of 15 to 30 oval-shaped leaflets. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk. Its wood is strong and durable, making it valuable for timber and furniture. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils near rivers and streams."
