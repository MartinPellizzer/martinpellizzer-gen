It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly encountered in its natural habitat."
