    "intro": "Justicia versicolor, commonly known as the whorled false heather, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that range from red to purple, often mistaken for petals. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs. The flowers are small and clustered in spikes, with showy, modified leaves (bracts) that serve to attract pollinators."
