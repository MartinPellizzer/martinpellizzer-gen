    "intro": "Jungia woodii, commonly known as the African violet, is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is native to tropical Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its compact rosette of velvety, dark green leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, often with a contrasting throat. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Jungia woodii is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
