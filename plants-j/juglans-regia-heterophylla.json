    "intro": "Juglans regia heterophylla, commonly known as the Persian walnut, is a variant of the Persian walnut tree native to regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its alternate leaf morphology, with juvenile leaves differing significantly from adult leaves in shape and size. The plant produces large, edible nuts enclosed in a thick, green husk that splits open when mature. Its leaves are typically bipinnately compound, with a broad, ovate outline and serrated margins. The tree is valued for its timber and nuts, and it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil."
