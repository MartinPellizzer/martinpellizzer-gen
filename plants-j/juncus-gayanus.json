    "intro": "Juncus gayanus, commonly known as Gay's rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that are usually greenish or brownish in color. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water. Juncus gayanus is also a valuable food source for various wildlife species."
