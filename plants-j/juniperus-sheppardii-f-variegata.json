    "intro": "Juniperus sheppardii f. variegata, commonly known as the variegated sheppard juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, featuring bright green leaves with white or yellow variegation, which enhances its ornamental value. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The variegated form distinguishes it from the typical green foliage of other juniper species, adding visual interest to gardens and landscapes."
