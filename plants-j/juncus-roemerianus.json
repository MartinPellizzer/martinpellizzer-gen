    "intro": "Juncus roemerianus, commonly known as saltwater rush, is a halophytic plant native to coastal regions of the United States. It thrives in brackish and saline wetlands, often found in marshes and tidal flats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. Its flowering spikes emerge from the base, producing small, clustered flowers that are pollinated by wind. Juncus roemerianus plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
