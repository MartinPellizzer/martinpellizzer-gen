    "intro": "Juncus \u00d7 royeri, commonly known as the hybrid rush, is a perennial plant that belongs to the Juncaceae family. It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Juncus effusus and Juncus tibeticus, leading to unique morphological characteristics. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. It produces tall, cylindrical inflorescences with small, greenish flowers that are wind-pollinated. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and wetland restoration projects."
