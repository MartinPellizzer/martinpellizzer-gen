The plant typically grows as a shrub or vine, with opposite, simple leaves that are usually ovate or elliptic in shape. Its flowers emit a sweet scent, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Jasminum sessile is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
