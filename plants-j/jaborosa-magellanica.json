    "intro": "Jaborosa magellanica, commonly known as the Magellanic jaborosa, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and produces small, yellow-orange flowers. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Jaborosa magellanica is also noted for its medicinal properties, traditionally used by indigenous communities for its purported health benefits."
