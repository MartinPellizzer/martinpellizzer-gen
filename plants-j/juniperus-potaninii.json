    "intro": "Juniperus potaninii, commonly known as the Siberian juniper, is a hardy coniferous shrub or small tree native to the cold climates of eastern Siberia and northern Mongolia. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves and small, blue-black berries that are typically harvested for use in herbal remedies. The plant is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in poor, sandy soils and withstanding extreme temperature fluctuations. Its slow growth rate and longevity make it a valuable component of alpine and subarctic ecosystems. Juniperus potaninii plays an important role in traditional medicine and is also used as a source of essential oils."
