    "intro": "Jagera pseudorhus var. pseudorhus, commonly known as the silky gum, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in coastal and dry woodland habitats. The silky gum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
