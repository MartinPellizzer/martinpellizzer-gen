    "intro": "Juniperus bacciformis, commonly known as the red juniper, is a species of coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are typically blue or red in color, containing toxic seeds that are not suitable for human consumption. Juniperus bacciformis is adapted to arid and rocky environments, often growing in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. It plays an important role in local ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
