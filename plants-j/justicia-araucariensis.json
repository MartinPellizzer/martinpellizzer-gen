    "intro": "Justicia araucariensis, commonly known as the kauri tree, is a large evergreen tree native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, tubular flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, arranged in spikes at the ends of branches. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland forest ecosystems. The kauri tree is also notable for its slow growth and long lifespan, with some individuals living over 500 years."
