It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories and stream banks. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
