    "intro": "Justicia viscosa, commonly known as sticky justicia, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, sticky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators, it is cultivated in some regions for landscaping purposes."
