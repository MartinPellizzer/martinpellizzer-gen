It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves with a distinctive reddish hue on the underside, and it produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments, making it a popular choice for wetland restoration projects. Its seeds are encased in a spiny capsule, and the plant contains toxic compounds, which deter herbivores."
