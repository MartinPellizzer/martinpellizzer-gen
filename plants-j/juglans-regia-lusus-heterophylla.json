The leaves are typically larger and broader on the upper parts of the plant compared to the smaller, more elongated leaves on the lower branches. It is native to regions of Central Asia and is cultivated for its ornamental and economic value. The plant thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
