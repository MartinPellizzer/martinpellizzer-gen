    "intro": "Jupunba asplenifolia, commonly known as the fern moss, is a unique plant found in the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Pterobryaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form. The plant has small, delicate leaves that resemble those of a fern, hence its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
