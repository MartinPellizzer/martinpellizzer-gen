    "intro": "Jacquemontia sinuata, commonly known as the silverleaf morningglory, is a herbaceous annual vine native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, silver-veined leaves that give it its common name, and its flowers are typically pale blue or white with five petals. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped blooms that open in the morning and close by midday. It thrives in moist, rich soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and disturbed areas. The seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, inflated capsule that splits open when mature to disperse the seeds."
