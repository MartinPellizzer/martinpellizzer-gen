    "intro": "Jambosa marginata, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its straight, dark red heartwood that is highly valued for its durability and rich color. The plant has a dense canopy with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer. Its flowers are small and fragrant, typically appearing in clusters, and it produces small, round fruits with a single seed. The tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value and timber, though it is also threatened by overharvesting."
