    "intro": "Jacksonia petrophiloides, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its woody stems and dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Jacksonia petrophiloides is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
