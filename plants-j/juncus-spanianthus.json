    "intro": "Juncus spanianthus, commonly known as the Spanish rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and damp meadows. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that are often green or reddish in color, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and they are arranged spirally around the stem. Juncus spanianthus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
