    "intro": "Jatropha pubescens, commonly known as the sticky nightshade, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that exude a sticky sap when damaged. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into orange-red, fleshy fruits. Its seeds are encased in a hard, spiny shell and are often dispersed by animals. Jatropha pubescens is also known for its toxic properties, with all parts of the plant containing harmful compounds."
