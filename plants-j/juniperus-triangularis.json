    "intro": "Juniperus triangularis, commonly known as the Mexican juniper, is a species of evergreen conifer native to Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Juniperus triangularis thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a valuable component of its native ecosystems."
