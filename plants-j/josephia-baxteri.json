    "intro": "Josephia baxteri, commonly known as the Baxter's lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its striking white petals with a pinkish tinge and a distinctive, narrow, grass-like leaf structure. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Josephia baxteri is considered a vulnerable species."
