    "intro": "Jatropha mollissima var. velutina, commonly known as the velvet jatropha, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, velvety leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers followed by orange-red berries containing toxic seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed habitats. Its ornamental value is sometimes appreciated, though caution is necessary due to the toxicity of its parts."
