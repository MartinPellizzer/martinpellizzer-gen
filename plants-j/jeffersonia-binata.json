    "intro": "Jeffersonia binata, commonly known as the Jeffersonia or the ghost flower, is a rare perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants like buckwheat and knotweed. The plant is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring. Jeffersonia binata is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as along streams and in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for ecosystem health."
