    "intro": "Jamesonia myriophylla, commonly known as the showy Jamesonia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage. The plant produces striking clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its leaves are elliptical, leathery, and have a distinctive waxy coating, contributing to its drought tolerance. Jamesonia myriophylla thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
