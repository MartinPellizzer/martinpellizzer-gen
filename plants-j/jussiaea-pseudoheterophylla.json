    "intro": "Jussiaea pseudoheterophylla, commonly known as the variable leaf jussiaea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Onagraceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is often found in wetland and marshy environments. The plant is characterized by its ability to produce two different types of leaves, known as heterophyllies, depending on the light conditions. Its small, white flowers bloom in clusters and attract various pollinators. Jussiaea pseudoheterophylla is an important species for ecological studies due to its adaptive leaf morphology."
