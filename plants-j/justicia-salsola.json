    "intro": "Justicia salsola, commonly known as desert willow, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, thriving in hot, dry climates. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink or red, attracting pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Justicia salsola is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand drought and poor soil conditions."
