    "intro": "Jacea paniculata, commonly known as the blue flag iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of North America. It features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring, typically in clusters along tall, slender stems. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often bright green and arranged in a fan-like pattern at the base. Jacea paniculata thrives in moist soil and partial to full sun, making it a common sight in marshes and along pond edges. Its showy flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological importance in wetland ecosystems."
