    "intro": "Juniperus rigida var. rigida, commonly known as the rigid juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage that is typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Juniperus rigida var. rigida is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental qualities."
