    "intro": "Juniperus chinensis f. pyramidalis, commonly known as the Chinese juniper pyramidalis, is a compact, evergreen conifer with a conical or pyramidal shape. It features scale-like leaves that are dark green and densely packed, giving it a dense, ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. It is native to China and thrives in well-drained soil and full sun conditions. This cultivar is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and attractive form."
