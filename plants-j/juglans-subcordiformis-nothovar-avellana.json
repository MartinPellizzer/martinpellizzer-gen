    "intro": "Juglans subcordiformis nothovar. avellana, commonly known as the hybrid walnut, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between Juglans subcordiformis and Juglans regia. It exhibits characteristics of both parent species, with a broad, subcordate leaf shape and a robust, nut-bearing habit. The plant thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its nuts are typically larger than those of J. subcordiformis but smaller than those of J. regia. This nothovar is valued for its hardiness and potential for nut production in cultivation."
