    "intro": "Grosourdya hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy grosourdya, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters, and bloom in the spring. Grosourdya hirsuta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and modest floral display."
