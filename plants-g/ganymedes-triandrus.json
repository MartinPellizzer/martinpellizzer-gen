    "intro": "Ganymedes triandrus, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. Its leaves are ovate and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Ganymedes triandrus is often found growing in rocky soils and is adapted to high altitudes."
