The leaves are leathery, dark green on top, and silvery white underneath, giving the plant its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest environments. The plant is also known for its aromatic leaves, which contain compounds used in traditional medicine and as a source of wintergreen oil."
