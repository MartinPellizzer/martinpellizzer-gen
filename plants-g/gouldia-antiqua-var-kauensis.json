    "intro": "Gouldia antiqua var. kauensis, commonly known as the Kauensis Gouldia, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that range from red to orange, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is known for its unique leaf morphology, with elliptical leaves that have a velvety texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
