    "intro": "Gouania, commonly known as the false hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The leaves are usually palmately lobed, and the fruits are capsules that release small seeds. Gouania species are often used in traditional medicine and have ornamental value in gardens."
