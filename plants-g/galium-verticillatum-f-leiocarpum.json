    "intro": "Galium verticillatum f. leiocarpum, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed bedstraw, is a variant of the bedstraw genus characterized by its slender, often hairless stems. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in whorls along the stems, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite and often trifoliate, contributing to its delicate, herbaceous appearance. This form is distinguished by its smoother stem texture compared to other variants of the species."
