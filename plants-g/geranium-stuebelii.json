    "intro": "Geranium stuebelii, commonly known as the Stuebel's geranium, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features upright stems with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
