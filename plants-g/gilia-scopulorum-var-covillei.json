    "intro": "Gilia scopulorum var. covillei, commonly known as the Coville's gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and clusters of showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, arid environments and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. It has small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Coville's gilia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
