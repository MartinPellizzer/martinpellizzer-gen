    "intro": "Guioa crenata, commonly known as the velvetwood or silverleaf guioa, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its lanceolate, dark green leaves with a silvery underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in catkin-like inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing smooth, oval seeds. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests and secondary growth areas. Guioa crenata is valued for its hard, heavy wood and is also used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage."
