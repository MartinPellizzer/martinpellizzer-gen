It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes many plants with milky sap. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia.

Its bark is thick and fibrous, and it is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
