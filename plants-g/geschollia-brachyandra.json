    "intro": "Geschollia brachyandra, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ghost orchid, is an epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, pale green or white flowers. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has modified stems that perform photosynthesis. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on the trunks of trees. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species."
