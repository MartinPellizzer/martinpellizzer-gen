    "intro": "Goniothalamus wynaadensis, commonly known as the Wynaad satinwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Annonaceae and is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests and along stream banks. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species and is of interest for both ecological and conservation studies."
