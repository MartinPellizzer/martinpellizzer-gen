    "intro": "Gaultheria lamii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wintergreen, is a perennial evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of South America. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, with a waxy coating. The plant produces tiny white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits in the fall. These fruits are edible and have a sharp, peppery flavor, often used in culinary applications. Gaultheria lamii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
