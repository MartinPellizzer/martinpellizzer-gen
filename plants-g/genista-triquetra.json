    "intro": "Genista triquetra, commonly known as the three-angled broom, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Genista triquetra is often found in rocky or coastal areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its hardy nature makes it a resilient plant in Mediterranean climates."
