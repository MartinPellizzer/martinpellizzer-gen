    "intro": "Gyrosorium angustatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and is characterized by its narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are arranged in a whorled pattern around the stem. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through oxygenation. Gyrosorium angustatum is often found in wetlands, ponds, and along the margins of streams."
