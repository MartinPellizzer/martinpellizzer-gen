    "intro": "Gilia rattanii, commonly known as the desert gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Gilia rattanii plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems in its native range."
