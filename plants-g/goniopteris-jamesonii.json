    "intro": "Goniopteris jamesonii, commonly known as the Jameson's cliff fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to two meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern along the undersides of its fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and wetland restoration projects."
