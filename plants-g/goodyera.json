    "intro": "Goodyera, commonly known as the rattledragon or mouse ear, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Orchidaceae. These plants are epiphytes, meaning they grow on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. They are characterized by their small, heart-shaped leaves and delicate, often green or white flowers. Goodyera species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded, moist environments. Their unique morphology and ecological adaptations make them interesting subjects for botanical study."
