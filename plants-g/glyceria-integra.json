    "intro": "Glyceria integra, commonly known as the smooth glyceria, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and riparian habitats. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Glyceria integra thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
