    "intro": "Glyceria pilosa, commonly known as hairy glyceria, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy environments. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, with a rough texture due to the presence of short, stiff hairs. Glyceria pilosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
