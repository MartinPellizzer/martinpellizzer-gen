    "intro": "Girardinia formosana, commonly known as the Formosan giant salamander, is a unique amphibian native to Taiwan. It belongs to the family Cryptobranchidae, which includes other large salamanders such as the hellbender. This species is characterized by its robust body, rough skin, and distinctive coloration that helps it blend into its rocky habitat. Girardinia formosana is typically found in fast-flowing streams and mountainous regions, where it thrives in cold, oxygen-rich waters. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts."
