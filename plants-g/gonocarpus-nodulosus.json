    "intro": "Gonocarpus nodulosus, commonly known as the nodular sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline and is often found in tidal zones. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its spread along coastal areas. Gonocarpus nodulosus plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small organisms."
