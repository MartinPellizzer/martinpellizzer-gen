    "intro": "Gymnadenia virginea, commonly known as the lesser butterfly orchid, is a species of orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial plant that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm. The plant produces tall, slender stems with lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that resemble butterflies. Gymnadenia virginea prefers moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Its flowers bloom from June to August, and it plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and moths."
