    "intro": "Gardoquia multiflora, commonly known as the multibract grass, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense clusters of small, grass-like leaves. The plant produces panicles of tiny, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots help it survive in dry conditions, and it is often found in rocky soils and open habitats. Gardoquia multiflora is valued for its ornamental potential and its role in stabilizing soils in semi-arid environments."
