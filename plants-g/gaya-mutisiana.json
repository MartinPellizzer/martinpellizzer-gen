    "intro": "Gaya mutisiana, commonly known as the Malayan wild coffee, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. It thrives in tropical rainforests and is often found in shaded, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
