    "intro": "Gymnogramma \u00d7 longipes, commonly known as the longipes fern, is a hybrid species within the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant produces small, round sporangia that are clustered on the underside of the leaves, a feature typical of many ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and garden cultivation."
