It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces striking spikes of tubular flowers, typically in shades of red or orange, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, often growing in shaded, moist forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
