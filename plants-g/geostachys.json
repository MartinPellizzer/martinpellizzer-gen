    "intro": "Geostachys, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their unique, often intricate floral structures and are typically found in rocky or arid environments. Geostachys species are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on rocks or other surfaces rather than in soil. They produce small, delicate flowers that are often brightly colored, which helps attract pollinators. Due to their specialized habitats, many species of Geostachys are rare and require specific environmental conditions to thrive."
