    "intro": "Gagea bohemica var. andegavensis, commonly known as the Bohemian spring beauty, is a perennial bulbous plant native to Central Europe. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest floors and thrives in temperate climates. The plant produces delicate, grass-like leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring. Its bulbs are adapted for storage and can remain dormant during unfavorable conditions. This variant is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and subtle morphological differences from the typical form of Gagea bohemica."
