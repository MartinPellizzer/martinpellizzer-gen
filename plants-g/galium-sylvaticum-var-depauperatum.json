    "intro": "Galium sylvaticum var. depauperatum, commonly known as the poorleaf woodypedia, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically features slender stems that are often prostrate or ascending, with small, opposite leaves that are usually lanceolate or ovate in shape. The flowers are small, white or pale green, and clustered in dense umbels, which are characteristic of the Rubiaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. This variant is distinguished by its reduced foliage compared to the typical form of Galium sylvaticum."
