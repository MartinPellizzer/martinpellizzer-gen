    "intro": "Glycinopsis densiflora, commonly known as the denseflower milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a deep root system, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
