    "intro": "Gentiana acaulis var. firmula, commonly known as the firm-stemmed gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stems that grow upright and are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its compact and elegant appearance. Gentiana acaulis var. firmula thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats."
