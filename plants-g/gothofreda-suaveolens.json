    "intro": "Gothofreda suaveolens, commonly known as the sweet-scented ghostflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale lavender petals and a subtle, sweet fragrance that becomes more pronounced at night. The plant has small, elongated leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. It blooms during the late spring and early summer, relying on nocturnal pollinators such as moths and bats. Due to habitat loss and its limited distribution, Gothofreda suaveolens is considered an endangered species."
