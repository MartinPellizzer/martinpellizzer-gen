    "intro": "Gaura hexandra subsp. gracilis, commonly known as the slender gaura, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of pale pink to white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and prefers full sun to partial shade. It thrives in well-drained soil and is often found in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and prairies. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
