    "intro": "Gnaphalium liebmannii var. monticola, commonly known as the mountain everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white to pale yellow, typically blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow, silvery-gray, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. This variety is often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, sunny conditions."
