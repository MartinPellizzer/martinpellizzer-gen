    "intro": "Geranium lignosum, commonly known as the wood geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features upright, branched stems that are somewhat woody at the base, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Geranium lignosum thrives in moist, shady habitats and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
