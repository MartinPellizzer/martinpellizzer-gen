It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by small, round fruits that turn from green to red when mature. The fruit is edible, though it has a tart, acidic flavor, and is often used in local cuisines and traditional medicine."
