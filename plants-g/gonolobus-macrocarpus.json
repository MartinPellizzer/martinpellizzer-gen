    "intro": "Gonolobus macrocarpus, commonly known as the giant tamarind, is a tropical shrub native to regions of Africa and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that are followed by long, woody pods containing edible seeds. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and potential pharmacological properties. However, it is also known to be toxic to livestock, making it a plant of both interest and caution."
