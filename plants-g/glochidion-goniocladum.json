It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing minute seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests or along stream banks.
