    "intro": "Glycine longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed soybean, is a climbing legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features pinnately compound leaves and produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. The plant is characterized by its long, slender stems and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Glycine longipes is also valued for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, enriching the soil. Its seeds are sometimes cultivated for their nutritional content, though it is less commercially significant than other soybean species."
