    "intro": "Galactia glabella, commonly known as the hairy bean, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically hairy and have a heart-shaped base. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by flat, bean-like pods containing several seeds. Its growth habit is often shrub-like, with woody stems that become more pronounced with age. Galactia glabella is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial in certain ecological and agricultural contexts."
