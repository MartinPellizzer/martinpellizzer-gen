    "intro": "Gomphosia longiflora var. densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered gomphosia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its pod-like fruits and often nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink or white. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it prefers full sun and moderate watering."
