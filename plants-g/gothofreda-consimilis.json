    "intro": "Gothofreda consimilis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on the trunks of trees. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Gothofreda consimilis is considered an endangered species."
