    "intro": "Galium glaucum var. grandiflorum, commonly known as silverweed or whitebeard, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of North America. It features slender, ascending stems that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and typically have a bluish-gray hue due to dense hair coverage. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, blooming in late spring to early summer. This plant thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks."
