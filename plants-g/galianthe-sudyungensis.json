    "intro": "Galianthe sudyungensis, commonly known as the Sudyung galianthe, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often along forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are elongated and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
