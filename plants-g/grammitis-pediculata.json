    "intro": "Grammitis pediculata, commonly known as the clustered spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern that belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its compact, moss-like appearance and dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves. This plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in high humidity. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered on the underside of its leaves, a feature typical of many ferns. Grammitis pediculata is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in maintaining soil moisture and supporting local biodiversity."
