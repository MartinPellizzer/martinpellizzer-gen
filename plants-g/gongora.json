    "intro": "Gongora, commonly known as the orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. Gongora orchids are characterized by their striking, often colorful flowers and their unique, intricate structures. They typically grow as epiphytes, meaning they attach themselves to trees or other surfaces without being parasitic. The genus includes over 200 species, many of which are prized for their ornamental value in horticulture."
