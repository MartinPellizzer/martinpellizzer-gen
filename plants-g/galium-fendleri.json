    "intro": "Galium fendleri, commonly known as desert bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are opposite, simple, and often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Galium fendleri plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
