It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine, glandular hairs, which contribute to its aromatic properties. Glandularia flava is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments."
