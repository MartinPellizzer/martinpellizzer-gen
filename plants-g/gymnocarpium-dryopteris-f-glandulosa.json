    "intro": "Gymnocarpium dryopteris f. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular barren fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive botanical features. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is native to regions of Asia, including China and Japan. The plant is notable for its reduced fronds, which are often smaller and more compact compared to the typical species. Its sporangia are borne on the undersides of the fronds, and the leaves are usually covered with glandular hairs, giving it its specific epithet. This fern is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices."
