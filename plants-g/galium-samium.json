It typically features slender, hairy stems that often lie close to the ground, forming dense mats. The plant has small, opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are clustered in small, spherical heads, and they are usually white or pale pink. Galium samium is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
