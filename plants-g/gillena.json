    "intro": "Gillena, commonly known as the gillenia, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to North America, particularly the eastern and central United States. The plants typically have showy, daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white or pale yellow petals. They often grow in moist, woodland environments and are valued for their ornamental appeal. Gillenia species are generally hardy perennials that thrive in partial to full shade."
