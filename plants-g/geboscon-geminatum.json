    "intro": "Geboscon geminatum, commonly known as the twin-leaf fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its feathery fronds that split into two distinct lobes, giving it its scientific name. The plant thrives in high humidity and partial shade, making it a challenging species to cultivate outside its natural habitat. Its leaves are bioluminescent at night, a unique feature that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is protected in many regions and is a subject of ongoing botanical research."
