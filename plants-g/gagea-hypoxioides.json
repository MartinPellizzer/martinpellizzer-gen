    "intro": "Gagea hypoxioides, commonly known as the narrowleaf gagea, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like foliage and small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its bulbs are underground and serve as storage organs, allowing the plant to survive in dry conditions. Gagea hypoxioides is often found in association with other spring-blooming plants in its native range."
