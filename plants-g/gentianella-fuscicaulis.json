    "intro": "Gentianella fuscicaulis, commonly known as the brown-stemmed gentian, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces striking blue to violet flowers in late summer. Its flowering stems are often tinged with brown, giving it its common name. Gentianella fuscicaulis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinator populations."
