    "intro": "Gyrocarpus americanus subsp. capuronianus, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its elongated, ridged fruits that contain a single large seed. The plant is notable for its unique reproductive structure, where the fruit develops from a modified leaf rather than a flower. It thrives in humid, lowland tropical forests and is economically important for its edible seeds. The tree also plays a significant role in local ecosystems and traditional medicine."
