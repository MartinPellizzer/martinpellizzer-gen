It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features opposite, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating, and it produces small, white to pale purple flowers in clusters. Its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind. Galium crassifolium is often found in rich, loamy soils and is part of the Rubiaceae family."
