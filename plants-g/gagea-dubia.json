    "intro": "Gagea dubia, commonly known as the rare mountain fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its flowers are often clustered in umbels. Gagea dubia is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found growing in rocky or alpine soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
