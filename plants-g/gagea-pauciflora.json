    "intro": "Gagea pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered gagea, is a small, perennial bulbous plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its clustered, narrow leaves and small, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically blooms in early spring and is often found in dry, open woodlands or rocky habitats. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in harsh conditions, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for early pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
