    "intro": "Galphimia brasiliensis var. pubescens, commonly known as the Brazilian flame flower, is a tropical shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant red or orange tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant has dark green, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, which is a distinguishing feature of the varietal form. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for warm climates. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which can last several months during the growing season."
