    "intro": "Grewia vestita, commonly known as the velvetleaf or white-flowered bushwillow, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and clusters of small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, round, red fruits that are edible and often consumed by birds and mammals. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in savanna and woodland habitats. Grewia vestita is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
