    "intro": "Galeopsis timbalii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hedge-nettle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges. Galeopsis timbalii is an annual herb that plays a role in supporting pollinators due to its nectar-rich flowers."
