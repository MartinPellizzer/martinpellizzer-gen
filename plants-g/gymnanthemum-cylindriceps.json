    "intro": "Gymnanthemum cylindriceps, commonly known as the cylindrical starflower, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, cylindrical stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and stream sides. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Gymnanthemum cylindriceps is valued for its delicate appearance and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
