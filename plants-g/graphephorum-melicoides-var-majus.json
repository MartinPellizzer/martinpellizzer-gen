    "intro": "Graphephorum melicoides var. majus, commonly known as the giant rock cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of thick, fleshy, blue-gray leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing on rocky outcrops or in dry, open habitats. Due to its unique appearance and adaptations to harsh environments, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes or rock gardens."
