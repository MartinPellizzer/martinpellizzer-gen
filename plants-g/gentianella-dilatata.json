    "intro": "Gentianella dilatata, commonly known as the narrowleaf gentian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while the stems are slender and branching. Gentianella dilatata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
