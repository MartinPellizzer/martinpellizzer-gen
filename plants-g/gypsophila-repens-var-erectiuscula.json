    "intro": "Gypsophila repens var. erectiuscula, commonly known as the upright baby's breath, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense clusters of tiny, fluffy white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branching stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its botanical name reflects its close relation to other gypsophila species, which are known for their delicate, lace-like floral displays."
