    "intro": "Glechoma hederacea var. montana, commonly known as mountain ground-ivy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features heart-shaped, opposite leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its creeping growth habit and ability to form dense mats make it an effective ground cover in natural habitats."
