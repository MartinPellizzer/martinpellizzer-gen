    "intro": "Gaultheria rigida, commonly known as the evergreen wintergreen, is a species of shrub native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible and have a sharp, spicy flavor. Gaultheria rigida is often found in acidic soils and thrives in shaded, moist environments. It is also valued for its aromatic leaves, which contain compounds used in traditional medicine and as a source of wintergreen oil."
