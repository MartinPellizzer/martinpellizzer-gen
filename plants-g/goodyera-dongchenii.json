    "intro": "Goodyera dongchenii, commonly known as the Chinese reflexed moss orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to China. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and unique floral structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in mountainous regions with rich, organic soil. Its flowers are usually greenish-white with intricate patterns, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
