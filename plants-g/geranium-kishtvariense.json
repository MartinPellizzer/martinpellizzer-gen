    "intro": "Geranium kishtvariense, commonly known as the Georgian geranium, is a perennial herb native to the Caucasus region. It features upright stems with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
