    "intro": "Goniopteris asterothrix, commonly known as the star-veined water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically divided into small, branching segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Goniopteris asterothrix is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
