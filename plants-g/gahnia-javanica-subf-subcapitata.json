It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are typically glabrous. The plant produces spikelets that are arranged in a compact panicle, with each spikelet containing two to three florets. It thrives in wetland or swampy habitats, often forming dense vegetation that stabilizes soil and provides habitat for various wildlife. Its botanical features make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
