    "intro": "Geranium thunbergii var. glabratum, commonly known as the smoothleaf geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It features upright stems with opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically glabrous or nearly hairless. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long-lasting blooms."
