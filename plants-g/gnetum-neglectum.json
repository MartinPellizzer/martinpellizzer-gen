    "intro": "Gnetum neglectum, commonly known as the African tropical gnetum, is a member of the Gnetophyta division, which includes gymnosperms. It is a woody shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa, characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces seeds enclosed in a fleshy, three-lobed structure, a feature that distinguishes it from typical gymnosperms. Its vascular system includes a unique type of xylem with sieve-like structures, reflecting its evolutionary position between gymnosperms and angiosperms."
