    "intro": "Gonystylus othmanii, commonly known as the Malaysian ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has compound leaves with opposite arrangement and produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland and hill forest areas. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, Gonystylus othmanii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
