    "intro": "Grastidium obliquum, commonly known as the leaning grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of South America. It features slender, erect stems that often lean at an angle, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in the early spring. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. Grastidium obliquum is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks."
