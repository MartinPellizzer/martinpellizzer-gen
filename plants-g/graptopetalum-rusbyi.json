    "intro": "Graptopetalum rusbyi, commonly known as the Rusby's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it an attractive and low-maintenance addition to arid landscapes."
