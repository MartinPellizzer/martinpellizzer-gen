    "intro": "Gnaphalium luteoalbum, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellowish to white flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its leaves are linear and covered with fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss. Native to regions of Europe and parts of Asia, it is often found in dry, open habitats such as coastal dunes and rocky slopes."
