    "intro": "Guzmania grandis, commonly known as the royal bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that can reach up to 3 meters in height, often displaying shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant's rosette of waxy, grass-like leaves forms a central cup that collects water and nutrients, supporting a micro-ecosystem. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Guzmania grandis is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
