    "intro": "Gueldenstaedtia monophylla, commonly known as the single-leaf vetch, is a perennial legume native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a single leaflet per leaf, which gives it its specific epithet \"monophylla.\" The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Gueldenstaedtia monophylla is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
