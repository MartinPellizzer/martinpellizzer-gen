    "intro": "Galium hierosolymitanum var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth bedstraw, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, ascending stems that are often covered with fine hairs, though the variety 'glabrum' is distinguished by its smooth, hairless appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats."
