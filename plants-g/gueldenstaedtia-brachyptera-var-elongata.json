    "intro": "Gueldenstaedtia brachyptera var. elongata, commonly known as the long-pod vetch, is a perennial legume native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated pods and trifoliate leaves, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, contributing to its ecological role in nitrogen fixation. Its adaptability to various soil types makes it a common sight in temperate regions."
