    "intro": "Grona dalzellii, commonly known as the Dalzell's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its botanical features include long, slender roots and a single, narrow stem that supports its showy blooms. Due to its elusive nature and limited habitat, Grona dalzellii is considered a critically endangered species."
