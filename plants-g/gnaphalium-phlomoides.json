    "intro": "Gnaphalium phlomoides, commonly known as silverweed, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a low-growing herb with a mat-forming habit, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant features small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by fluffy, white seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are typically silver-gray in appearance, covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss. Gnaphalium phlomoides is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
