    "intro": "Gomphandra pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered gomphandra, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
