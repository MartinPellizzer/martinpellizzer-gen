    "intro": "Goniophlebium brasiliense, commonly known as the Brazilian fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as streams and ponds, where it attaches itself to rocks or submerged substrates. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant along the substrate. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
