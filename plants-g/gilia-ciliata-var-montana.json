    "intro": "Gilia ciliata var. montana, commonly known as the mountain gilia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in mountainous regions, thriving in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, and it produces seed pods that split open to release tiny seeds. This species is often found in alpine and subalpine environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
