    "intro": "Galium leucotrichum, commonly known as silverweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often covered with fine, silky hairs that give it a silvery appearance. Galium leucotrichum is adapted to arid environments and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
