    "intro": "Gesneria parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered gesneria, is a species of flowering plant in the Gesneriaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in areas with high humidity and warm climates. The plant is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Gesneria parviflora is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
