    "intro": "Gluta tourtour, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a species of mangrove tree native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant has a distinctive prop root system that provides structural support in waterlogged soils. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species. Gluta tourtour is also valued for its timber and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
