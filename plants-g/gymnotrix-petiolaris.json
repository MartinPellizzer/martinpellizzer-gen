    "intro": "Gymnotrix petiolaris, commonly known as the petiole fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that arise from a central rhizome. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that are often covered in fine hairs. Gymnotrix petiolaris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light."
