    "intro": "Gliricidia brenningii, commonly known as the white gliricidia, is a fast-growing leguminous tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It features bipinnate leaves that are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder for livestock. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. Gliricidia brenningii is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its utility in agroforestry systems."
