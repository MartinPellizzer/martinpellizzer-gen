It produces small, yellowish-green fruits that are typically eaten raw or used in local cuisines. The plant has compound leaves with opposite arrangement and bears small, white flowers that are clustered in cymes. Its botanical classification places it within the family Salicaceae, though it is more closely related to the mulberry family. The fruit's unique flavor and nutritional value make it an important plant in traditional agriculture and food systems."
