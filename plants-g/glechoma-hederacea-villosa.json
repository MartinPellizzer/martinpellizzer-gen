    "intro": "Glechoma hederacea villosa, commonly known as hairy ground-ivy, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the ground. The leaves are heart-shaped, covered in fine, silky hairs, giving the plant its \"hairy\" appearance. It produces small, pale blue or violet flowers in early spring, which are clustered in whorls along the stems. This plant is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and along stream banks."
