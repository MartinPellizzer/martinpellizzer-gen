    "intro": "Geranium nodosum, commonly known as the clustered geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features upright stems with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or red flowers with five petals, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long flowering period."
