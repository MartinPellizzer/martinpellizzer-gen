    "intro": "Guettarda leiantha, commonly known as the beach hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of tropical America. It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows in sandy or limestone soils along shorelines. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petals, often accompanied by red calyces that persist after flowering. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. Guettarda leiantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh coastal environments."
