    "intro": "Geophila macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited wood sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, yellow, spurred flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats. The showy, delicate flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance."
