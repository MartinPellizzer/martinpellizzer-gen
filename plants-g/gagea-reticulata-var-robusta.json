    "intro": "Gagea reticulata var. robusta, commonly known as the robust netted squill, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It features a compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale pink flowers in early spring. The plant's bulbs are covered in a fibrous, net-like structure, which is characteristic of the genus Gagea. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
