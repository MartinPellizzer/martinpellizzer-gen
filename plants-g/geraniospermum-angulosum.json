It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its angular, succulent stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its flowers, which range in color from pink to red, bloom during the warmer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds.
