    "intro": "Glyceria striata, commonly known as the narrowleaf glyceria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and riparian habitats. It has linear, grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and have a distinct midrib. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Glyceria striata is often found in moist soils and can thrive in both freshwater and brackish environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
