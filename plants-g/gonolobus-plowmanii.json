    "intro": "Gonolobus plowmanii, commonly known as the slender false indigo, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that mature in the fall, and the plant is often found in moist, disturbed soils along riverbanks and woodland edges. Gonolobus plowmanii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
