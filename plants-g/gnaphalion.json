    "intro": "Gnaphalion, commonly known as the rockrose, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Crassulaceae. These plants are typically small shrubs characterized by their fleshy, often succulent leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. They are native to arid and rocky regions across Europe, Asia, and Africa. Gnaphalion species are adapted to drought conditions, with thick leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. Their flowers, which can be white, yellow, or pink, bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
