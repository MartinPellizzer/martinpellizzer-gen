    "intro": "Grammitis dependens, commonly known as the hanging fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows on tree trunks or branches, forming dense, cascading clusters that give it its common name. The plant has slender, arching fronds with a distinctive, glossy dark green coloration. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds. Grammitis dependens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
