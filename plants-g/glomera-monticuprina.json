    "intro": "Glomera monticuprina, commonly known as the mountain glomera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic and edible plants. The plant features slender, upright stems with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its small, white flowers are clustered in umbels, a characteristic feature of the Apiaceae family. Glomera monticuprina is adapted to cold, nutrient-poor soils and thrives in moist, well-drained environments."
