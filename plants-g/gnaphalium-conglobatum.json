    "intro": "Gnaphalium conglobatum, commonly known as the clustered everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Gnaphalium conglobatum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
