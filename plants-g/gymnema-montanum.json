    "intro": "Gymnema montanum, commonly known as the Indian bitter apple, is a climbing plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant is notable for its unique ability to suppress the taste of sweetness, a property attributed to the presence of gymnemic acids. Its fruits are small, green berries that turn red when mature, and the plant is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Gymnema montanum is also valued in traditional Ayurvedic medicine for its potential health benefits."
