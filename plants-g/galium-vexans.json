    "intro": "Galium vexans, commonly known as the creeping bedstraw, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and have a slightly hairy texture. Galium vexans is often found in moist, disturbed soils along roadsides, streambanks, and woodland edges."
