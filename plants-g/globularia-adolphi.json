It features dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a compact, spherical shape, giving it its common name, and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are evergreen in mild climates. Globularia adolphi is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping."
