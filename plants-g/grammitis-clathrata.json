    "intro": "Grammitis clathrata, commonly known as the net-veined fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are densely covered with small, clustered sporangia. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in rainforests. Its unique morphology includes a complex network of veins that give it its common name. Grammitis clathrata plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to biodiversity and providing microhabitats for various organisms."
