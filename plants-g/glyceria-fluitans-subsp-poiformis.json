    "intro": "Glyceria fluitans subsp. poiformis, commonly known as the floating glyceria, is a herbaceous wetland plant native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its creeping rhizomes and tufted, grass-like foliage that often grows in shallow water or moist soil. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a slightly waxy coating, aiding in water retention. This subspecies is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of rivers, contributing to aquatic ecosystem stability."
