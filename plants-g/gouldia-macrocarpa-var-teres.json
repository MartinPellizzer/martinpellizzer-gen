    "intro": "Gouldia macrocarpa var. teres, commonly known as the Woolly Nettle, is a striking ornamental plant native to Australia. It features dense, woolly foliage that gives it a soft, fluffy appearance, particularly on its dark green, velvety leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its unique texture and color, it is often used in horticultural displays to add visual interest."
