    "intro": "Glossoloma medusaeum, commonly known as the sea hare orchid, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that resemble the shape of a sea hare, hence its common name. The plant thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found growing near rocky shores or in coastal forests. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and waxy, strap-like leaves that help it retain moisture in its saline-rich habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Glossoloma medusaeum is considered a vulnerable species."
