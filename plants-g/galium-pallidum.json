    "intro": "Galium pallidum, commonly known as pale bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender stems that are often hairy and bear small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and have a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Galium pallidum produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, facilitating its spread in suitable habitats."
