    "intro": "Glinus herniarioides, commonly known as the creeping iron vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a low-growing herbaceous plant that typically forms dense mats on the ground. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. It is adapted to thrive in disturbed soils and can often be found in grasslands or along roadsides. Its botanical features make it a common weed in many areas where it grows prolifically."
