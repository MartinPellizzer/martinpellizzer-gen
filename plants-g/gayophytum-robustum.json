    "intro": "Gayophytum robustum, commonly known as the African violet, is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves and showy, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of violet, pink, and white. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements. Gayophytum robustum is known for its ability to produce offsets, which can be propagated to create new plants."
