    "intro": "Gleichenia angusta, commonly known as narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, mat-like structure. The plant is native to various regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and the Himalayas, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Gleichenia angusta has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form extensive colonies. Its fronds are often dimorphic, with fertile and sterile leaves differing in size and shape."
