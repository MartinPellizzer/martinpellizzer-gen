    "intro": "Gleichenia flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible wood fern, is a fern species belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are often curved or twisted, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in high humidity. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Gleichenia flexuosa is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
