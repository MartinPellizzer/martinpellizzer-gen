    "intro": "Gaultheria eriophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wintergreen, is a species of flowering plant in the Ericaceae family. It is native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for both humans and wildlife. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with narrow, leathery leaves that provide a dense, low-growing cover. Gaultheria eriophylla is also valued for its aromatic leaves, which contain compounds used in traditional medicine and as a source of wintergreen oil."
