    "intro": "Gentiana odontosepala, commonly known as the toothed gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often arranged in a basal rosette. Its flowers are typically tubular with five distinct, tooth-like lobes at the mouth, giving it its common name. Gentiana odontosepala prefers cool, moist habitats and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
