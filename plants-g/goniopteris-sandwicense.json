    "intro": "Goniopteris sandwicense, commonly known as the Hawaiian tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a unique reproductive system, producing spores on the underside of its fronds rather than flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rainforests and along stream banks. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
