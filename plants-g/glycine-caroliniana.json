It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets and produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant bears pods that contain several elliptical seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Glycine caroliniana is characterized by its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it valuable in ecological restoration projects. Its botanical features make it an important species for both ecological and agricultural studies."
