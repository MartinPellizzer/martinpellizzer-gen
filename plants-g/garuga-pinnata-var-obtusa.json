    "intro": "Garuga pinnata var. obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leafed garuga, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, ovate to elliptical leaves that are usually smooth and glossy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, elongated fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
