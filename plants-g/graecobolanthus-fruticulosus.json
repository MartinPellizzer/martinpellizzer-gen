    "intro": "Graecobolanthus fruticulosus, commonly known as the fruit-bearing sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, blooming during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it has a fibrous root system adapted to poor soil conditions. Graecobolanthus fruticulosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and visual interest."
