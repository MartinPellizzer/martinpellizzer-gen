    "intro": "Geranium pyrenaicum f. pallidum, commonly known as the pale geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features upright stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are palmately lobed with a hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often found in rocky or alpine environments. This form is distinguished by its lighter-colored flowers and reduced leaf pubescence compared to the typical species."
