    "intro": "Gentiana calycosa var. xantha, commonly known as the yellow gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers, which contrast sharply with its dark green, velvety leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and alpine meadows. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early autumn, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. The yellow gentian is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
