    "intro": "Galium polonicum, commonly known as Polish bedstraw, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from June to August. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Galium polonicum is native to Europe and is often found in moist meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils."
