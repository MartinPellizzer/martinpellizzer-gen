    "intro": "Galium hierosolymitanum var. hispidum, commonly known as the Jerusalem candle or hairy bedstraw, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. Its hairy texture and unique floral structure make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
