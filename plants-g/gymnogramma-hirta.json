    "intro": "Gymnogramma hirta, commonly known as the hairy gymnogramma, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in small groups. Gymnogramma hirta is native to regions in Southeast Asia and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
