    "intro": "Gnetum edule, commonly known as the edible gnetum, is a member of the Gnetophyta division, characterized by its unique combination of gymnosperm and angiosperm traits. It is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia, often found in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, scale-like seeds enclosed in a fleshy, edible aril, which is consumed by various local communities. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a glossy surface and a distinctive, aromatic scent. Gnetum edule plays a role in both ecological systems and traditional subsistence practices in its native habitats."
