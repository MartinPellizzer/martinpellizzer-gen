    "intro": "Grevillea juniperina subsp. fortis, commonly known as the coastal grevillea, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, providing a striking visual contrast. The plant produces vibrant red or orange flowers in raceme clusters, which bloom in spring and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It is adapted to sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a popular choice for native landscaping."
