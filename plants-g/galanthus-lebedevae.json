    "intro": "Galanthus lebedevae, commonly known as the Lebedev's snowdrop, is a rare and endangered species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, nodding white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soil and partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging from a bulbous underground stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a conservation priority."
