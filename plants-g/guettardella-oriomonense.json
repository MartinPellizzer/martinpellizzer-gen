    "intro": "Guettardella oriomonense, commonly known as the Sierra Madre dwarf fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its small, compact fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in cloud forests at high altitudes. Its rhizomes are short and fibrous, supporting its growth in rocky or soil-rich substrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
