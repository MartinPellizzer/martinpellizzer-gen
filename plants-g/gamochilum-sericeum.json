It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves and showy, pale yellow or greenish-white flowers. It is often found growing in forest understories, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its unique appearance and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
