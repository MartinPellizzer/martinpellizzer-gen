It is characterized by its slender, arching branches and bright red or orange flowers that bloom in spring. The foliage consists of narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. This subspecies is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
