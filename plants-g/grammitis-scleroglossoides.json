    "intro": "Grammitis scleroglossoides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, dark green, leathery fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Grammitis scleroglossoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, indoor settings."
