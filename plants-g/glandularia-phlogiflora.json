    "intro": "Glandularia phlogiflora, commonly known as the flameweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which helps in deterring herbivores. The plant produces vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Glandularia phlogiflora is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
