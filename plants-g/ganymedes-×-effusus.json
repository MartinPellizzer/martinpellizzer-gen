    "intro": "Ganymedes \u00d7 effusus, commonly known as the hybrid hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree that exhibits a blend of characteristics from its parent species, Ganymedes and effusus. It typically features smooth, gray bark and clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or open areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its spring blossoms and autumn foliage."
