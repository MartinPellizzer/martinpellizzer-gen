    "intro": "Gayophytum lasiospermum var. eriospermum, commonly known as the woolly sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or inland regions with a Mediterranean climate. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The variety eriospermum is distinguished by its dense, woolly covering on the stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments."
