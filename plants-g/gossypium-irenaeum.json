    "intro": "Gossypium irenaeum, commonly known as the Irenaean cotton, is a species of cotton plant native to the arid regions of northern Africa. It is characterized by its soft, fluffy fibers that are used in textile production, similar to other cotton species. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with hairy stems and broad, lobed leaves. Its flowers are small and pale green, often clustered in racemes, and it produces capsules that contain the fibrous seeds. Due to its adaptation to harsh environments, Gossypium irenaeum is of interest for studying drought-resistant plant traits."
