It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its distinctive, rough-textured leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Gouania sulcata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
