    "intro": "Genista patula, commonly known as the creeping broom, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has slender, woody stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly through vegetative propagation. Its leaves are small, alternate, and trifoliate, with each leaflet being elliptic in shape. Genista patula thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common ornamental plant in gardens and landscapes."
