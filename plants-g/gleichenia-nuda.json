    "intro": "Gleichenia nuda, commonly known as the naked Gleichenia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright fronds that are typically unbranched and have a delicate, grass-like appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small, rounded structures called sori. Gleichenia nuda is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its simple morphology and ecological adaptability make it a common sight in temperate and subtropical regions."
