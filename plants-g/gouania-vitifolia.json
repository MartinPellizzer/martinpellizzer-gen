    "intro": "Gouania vitifolia, commonly known as the grapeleaf gouania, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are often lobed and resemble the shape of grape leaves, giving it its common name. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Gouania vitifolia is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along riverbanks."
