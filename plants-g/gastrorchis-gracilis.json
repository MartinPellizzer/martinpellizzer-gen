    "intro": "Gastrorchis gracilis, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, often growing in rocky or dry habitats. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the soil, and it has a short-lived lifespan, often completing its life cycle within a single growing season. Gastrorchis gracilis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
