    "intro": "Grammadenia asymmetrica, commonly known as the asymmetric orchid, is a unique species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, asymmetrical flower structure, which sets it apart from most other orchid species. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along streams. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy texture, aiding in water retention. The flowers, which bloom in late spring, are usually pale green or yellow, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators."
