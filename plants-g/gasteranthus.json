    "intro": "Gasteranthus, commonly known as the \"pocket orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gesneriaceae. These plants are native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. They are characterized by their unique, often brightly colored, tubular flowers that resemble small pockets or pouches. The flowers are typically pollinated by specific species of beetles, which are attracted to the plant's scent and structure. Gasteranthus species are popular among horticulturists for their ornamental value and ease of cultivation."
