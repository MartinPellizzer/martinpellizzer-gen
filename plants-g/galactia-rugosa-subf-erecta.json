    "intro": "Galactia rugosa subf. erecta, commonly known as the erect milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, trifoliate leaves, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain several kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Galactia rugosa subf. erecta plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
