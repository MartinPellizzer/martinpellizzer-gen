    "intro": "Galatella \u00d7 sublinosyris, commonly known as the hybrid galatella, is a flowering plant in the Apiaceae family. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Galatella linosyris and Galatella sublobata, characterized by its compound umbels of small white or greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are pinnately lobed and often have a distinctive, slightly hairy texture. The species is of interest to botanists due to its hybrid origin and potential ecological adaptations."
