    "intro": "Genista tinctoria var. prostrata, commonly known as creeping yellow broom, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. This variety is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soils."
