    "intro": "Gagea dayana var. conjungens, commonly known as the clustered gagea, is a flowering plant belonging to the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to the western United States, particularly California, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in a tight cluster, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. This variety is distinguished by its dense flowering pattern and is valued for its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
