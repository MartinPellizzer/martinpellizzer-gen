    "intro": "Geonoma acaulis subsp. tapajotensis, commonly known as the Tapaj\u00f3s geonoma, is a species of fern native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant produces small, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found on rocky outcrops or in moist soil. Due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution, it is of interest to botanists studying tropical flora."
