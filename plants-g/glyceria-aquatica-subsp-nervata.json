    "intro": "Glyceria aquatica subsp. nervata, commonly known as the narrow-veined watergrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soils, often found in marshes, ponds, and along stream edges. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often submerged or only partially emergent. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with distinct parallel veins, giving it its subspecies name. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny flowers, contributing to its ecological role in aquatic ecosystems."
