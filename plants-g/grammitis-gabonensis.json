    "intro": "Grammitis gabonensis, commonly known as Gabon filmy fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Central and West Africa. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae, which is characterized by small, delicate leaves and a preference for moist, shaded environments. The plant's fronds are usually narrow and elongated, with a leathery texture and a distinct midrib. It thrives in tropical rainforests, often growing on trees or rocks in humid conditions. Grammitis gabonensis plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to canopy microhabitats and providing shelter for small organisms."
