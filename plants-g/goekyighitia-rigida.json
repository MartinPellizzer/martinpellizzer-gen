    "intro": "Goekyighitia rigida, commonly known as the rigid goekyighit, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine soils. Its rigid, upright stems and small, greenish-white flowers are adaptations to its harsh mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Goekyighitia rigida is considered a vulnerable species."
