    "intro": "Ghinia spinosa, commonly known as the spiny henna, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in sharp, spiny projections, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the dry season. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to minimize water loss in harsh environments. Ghinia spinosa is also valued for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its therapeutic uses."
