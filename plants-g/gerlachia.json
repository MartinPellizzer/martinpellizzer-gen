    "intro": "Gerlachia, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants are shrubs or small trees, often characterized by their woody stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. Gerlachia species are adapted to hot, dry environments and have small, thick leaves to reduce water loss. They play an important ecological role in desert ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small animals."
