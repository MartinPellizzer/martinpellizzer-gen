    "intro": "Galeopsis ladanum var. canescens, commonly known as hairy blueweed, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its slender, branching stems covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in whorled clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped and also bear a similar hairy texture, contributing to its overall appearance. Galeopsis ladanum var. canescens is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
