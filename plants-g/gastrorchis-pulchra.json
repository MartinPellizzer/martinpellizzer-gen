    "intro": "Gastrorchis pulchra, commonly known as the beautiful orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature vibrant colors such as red, orange, and yellow. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients, adapting to its often dry or seasonally variable habitat. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Gastrorchis pulchra is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its unique floral display."
