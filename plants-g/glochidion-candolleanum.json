    "intro": "Glochidion candolleanum, commonly known as the white-flowered glochidion, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often surrounded by specialized bracts. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Glochidion candolleanum is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices."
