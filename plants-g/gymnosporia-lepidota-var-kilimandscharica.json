    "intro": "Gymnosporia lepidota var. kilimandscharica, commonly known as the Kilimanjaro burr acacia, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its spiny stems and compound leaves with small, leathery leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by woody, spiny pods that contain seeds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, arid climates. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in mountainous habitats and is sometimes used for erosion control."
