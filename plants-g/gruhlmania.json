    "intro": "Gruhlmania, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its enormous, floating leaves that can reach up to three meters in diameter. The plant has a thick, waxy cuticle on its leaves to prevent water loss and support its massive size. Its flowers are typically white or pink and bloom at night, attracting specific pollinators. Gruhlmania plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic life and contributing to nutrient cycling in the water."
