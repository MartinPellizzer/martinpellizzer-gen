    "intro": "Gagea luberonensis, commonly known as the Luberon gagea, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces a single, elongated bulb that stores nutrients for the next growing season. It typically blooms in early spring and is adapted to grow in well-drained, rocky soils. Gagea luberonensis is often found in woodland edges and open meadows, where it thrives in partial shade."
