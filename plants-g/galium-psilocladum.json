    "intro": "Galium psilocladum, commonly known as the ghostflower or ghost plant, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing shrub that typically thrives in sandy or rocky soils, often found in desert or semi-desert environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise sparse appearance. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Galium psilocladum is also known for its ability to survive in extreme temperatures and limited water conditions."
