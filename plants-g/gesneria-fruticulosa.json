    "intro": "Gesneria fruticulosa, commonly known as the dwarf gesneria, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It features broad, glossy, dark green leaves that are often slightly curled at the edges. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Gesneria fruticulosa is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
