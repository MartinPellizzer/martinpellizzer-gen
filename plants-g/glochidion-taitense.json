    "intro": "Glochidion taitense, commonly known as the Taiti hibiscus, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Islands, particularly Tahiti and Moorea. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often pubescent. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by capsule fruits that release tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests or on rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
