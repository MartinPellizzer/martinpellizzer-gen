    "intro": "Grindelia nana var. columbiana, commonly known as the dwarf goldenweed, is a low-growing plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compact stature, with gray-green foliage and yellow composite flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry meadows and rocky areas. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it an important plant in native landscapes."
