    "intro": "Gleichenia costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican fern, is a species of fern native to Central America. It belongs to the family Gleicheniaceae and is characterized by its long, strap-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizome is creeping and forms dense colonies, which help in soil stabilization. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds."
