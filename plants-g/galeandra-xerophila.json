    "intro": "Galeandra xerophila, commonly known as the desert orchid, is a species of orchid native to arid regions of Central America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and its ability to thrive in low-nutrient, well-drained soils. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and purple, often blooming during the dry season. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. Galeandra xerophila is well-suited to xerophytic environments, making it a valuable plant for drought-tolerant landscaping."
