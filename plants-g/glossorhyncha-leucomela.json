It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically feature white petals and a yellow lip. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The orchid's floral structure is specialized for pollination by specific insects, such as bees and wasps."
