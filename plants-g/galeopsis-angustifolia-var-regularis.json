    "intro": "Galeopsis angustifolia var. regularis, commonly known as narrow-leaved hedge-nettle, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, riverbanks, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. The plant features slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and it produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining soil stability in its native habitats."
