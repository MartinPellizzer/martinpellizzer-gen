    "intro": "Galium verum var. littorale, commonly known as sea bedstraw, is a variant of the bedstraw plant native to coastal regions. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is adapted to salty, windy environments."
