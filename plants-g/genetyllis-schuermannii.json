    "intro": "Genetyllis schuermannii, commonly known as Schuermann's bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing above the water surface. Genetyllis schuermannii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms."
