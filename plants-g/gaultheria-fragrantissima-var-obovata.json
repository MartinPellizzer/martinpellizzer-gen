    "intro": "Gaultheria fragrantissima var. obovata, commonly known as the fragrant wax myrtle, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, oval-shaped leaves that are glossy and emit a pleasant, aromatic scent. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands and forest understories. Its ornamental value and ability to attract wildlife make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
