It is characterized by its striking, bottlebrush-like inflorescences that range in color from pink to white. The plant produces nectar-rich flowers that attract a variety of pollinators, including honeyeaters and bees. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slight waxy coating. Grevillea strangea is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species."
