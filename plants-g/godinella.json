    "intro": "Godinella, commonly known as the red spider lily, is a striking plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its vibrant red flowers that bloom in the spring, often preceding the emergence of its foliage. The plant features narrow, strap-like leaves that are evergreen and remain throughout the year. Godinella thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its botanical name, *Lycoris radiata*, reflects its radiant appearance and its significance in traditional Asian culture."
