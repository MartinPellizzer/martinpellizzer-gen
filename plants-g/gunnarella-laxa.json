    "intro": "Gunnarella laxa, commonly known as the slender gumtree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of northern Australia. It typically grows to a height of 5 to 15 meters, featuring a slender, often crooked trunk and dense, glossy green foliage. The leaves are alternate, lanceolate, and have a leathery texture, contributing to its drought-resistant characteristics. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. The plant is well adapted to the humid, nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat."
