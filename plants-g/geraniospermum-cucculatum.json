    "intro": "Geraniospermum cucculatum, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant has woody stems and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Geraniospermum cucculatum is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
