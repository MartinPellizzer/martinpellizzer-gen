    "intro": "Gnetum, commonly known as the gymnosperm family, includes a group of flowering plants that are closely related to conifers. These plants are characterized by their unique combination of features, including the presence of vessels in their xylem, which is more typical of angiosperms. Gnetum species are predominantly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing as shrubs or small trees. They have simple, usually opposite leaves and produce seeds enclosed in a structure called an ovary, which is a trait not seen in other gymnosperms. The genus includes several species, such as Gnetum gnemon and Gnetum montanum, which are notable for their ecological and medicinal significance."
