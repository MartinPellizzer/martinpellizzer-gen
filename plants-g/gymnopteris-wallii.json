    "intro": "Gymnopteris wallii, commonly known as the Wall's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive appearance that resembles the leaves of holly. Native to Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, a typical feature of ferns. Gymnopteris wallii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
