    "intro": "Glechoma kotschyi, commonly known as Persian ground ivy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to regions of Central Asia and the Caucasus. It features creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to June. Its heart-shaped leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Glechoma kotschyi is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors and rocky slopes."
