    "intro": "Gagea bulbifera, commonly known as the bulbous gagea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Liliaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of western North America, including parts of California and Oregon. The plant is characterized by its cluster of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. Its most distinctive feature is the production of bulb-like structures, which serve as storage organs and help the plant survive in its harsh environment. Gagea bulbifera is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in high-altitude habitats."
