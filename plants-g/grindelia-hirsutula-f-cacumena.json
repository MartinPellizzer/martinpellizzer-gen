    "intro": "Grindelia hirsutula f. cacumena, commonly known as the hairy bittercress, is a flowering plant in the sunflower family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is native to the western United States and thrives in dry, disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to harsh, semi-arid conditions."
