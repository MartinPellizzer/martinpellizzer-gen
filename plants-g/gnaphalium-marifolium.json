    "intro": "Gnaphalium marifolium, commonly known as the marsh cudweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with numerous small, daisy-like flowers. The plant produces fluffy, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in wetland environments. Gnaphalium marifolium is often found in moist, open habitats such as marshes, meadows, and stream banks."
