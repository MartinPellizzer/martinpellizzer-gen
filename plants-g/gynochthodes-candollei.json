    "intro": "Gynochthodes candollei, commonly known as the Candolle's ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, ephemeral flowers that bloom only briefly during the rainy season. The plant has a slender, wiry stem and produces small, pale greenish-white flowers with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree bark or in rocky crevices. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
