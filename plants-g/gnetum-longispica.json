    "intro": "Gnetum longispica, commonly known as the long-spined gnetum, is a unique gymnosperm native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its deciduous leaves, which are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, scale-like seeds that are enclosed in a fleshy, cup-like structure called an aril. Its vascular system includes a unique type of xylem with spiral tracheids, which is a distinguishing feature among gymnosperms. Gnetum longispica is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as rainforests and montane regions."
