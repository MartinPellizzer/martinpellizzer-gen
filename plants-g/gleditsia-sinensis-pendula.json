    "intro": "Gleditsia sinensis pendula, commonly known as the weeping honeylocust, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its distinctive pendulous branches that create a cascading effect, making it a striking ornamental plant. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, which are followed by slender, bean-like pods. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of multiple pairs of small, oval leaflets. The plant is adapted to a variety of soil types and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
