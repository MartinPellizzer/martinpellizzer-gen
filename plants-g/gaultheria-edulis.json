    "intro": "Gaultheria edulis, commonly known as the common wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and produces small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is notable for its aromatic leaves, which contain methyl salicylate, giving it a distinctive wintergreen scent. Gaultheria edulis typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. It is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
