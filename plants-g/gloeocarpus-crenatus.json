    "intro": "Gloeocarpus crenatus, commonly known as the swamp hibiscus, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and along riverbanks, where it can tolerate waterlogged soil. Its roots are often submerged, and it plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems. Gloeocarpus crenatus is also known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with moist conditions."
