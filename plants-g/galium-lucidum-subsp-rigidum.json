    "intro": "Galium lucidum subsp. rigidum, commonly known as stiff wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant features small, heart-shaped leaves with a glossy surface and produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers. Its stems are rigid and somewhat succulent, which helps it retain moisture in wet habitats. The species is part of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
