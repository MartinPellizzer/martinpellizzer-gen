    "intro": "Gleichenia flabellata, commonly known as the fan fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped fronds that are often divided into narrow, linear segments. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of sporangia on the underside of the fronds. Gleichenia flabellata is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often used in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal."
