    "intro": "Glyceria aquatica var. pallens, commonly known as the slender watergrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually pale green, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic habitats. This variant is distinguished by its pale coloration and slender growth form compared to other Glyceria species."
