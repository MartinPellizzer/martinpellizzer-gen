    "intro": "Guettarda reticulata, commonly known as the laceleaf guettarda, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and northern South America. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its adaptability to coastal environments makes it a common ornamental plant in warm climates. Guettarda reticulata is also valued for its ability to thrive in sandy soils and tolerate salt spray."
