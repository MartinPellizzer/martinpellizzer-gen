    "intro": "Genetyllis helichrysoides, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow to golden-orange flowers that are typically arranged in dense clusters. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Genetyllis helichrysoides is often cultivated as a ornamental plant due to its drought tolerance and long-lasting flowers."
