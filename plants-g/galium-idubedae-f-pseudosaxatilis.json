    "intro": "Galium idubedae f. pseudosaxatilis, commonly known as the rock bedstraw, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers, typically in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to grow in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous or alpine regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species in its native range."
