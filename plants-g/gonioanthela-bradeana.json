    "intro": "Gonioanthela bradeana, commonly known as the Bradean ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is a terrestrial orchid with a unique morphology, featuring a slender, wiry stem and small, pale greenish-white flowers. The plant is known for its ephemeral blooming, often only flowering once every few years, making it a challenging subject for study. Its habitat is highly specific, requiring a moist, shaded environment with rich, organic soil. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Gonioanthela bradeana is considered vulnerable and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
