    "intro": "Gentiana dentiformis, commonly known as the toothed gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and alpine meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a serrated or toothed margin, giving it its common name. Gentiana dentiformis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported medicinal properties."
