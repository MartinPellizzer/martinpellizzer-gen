    "intro": "Gaultheria gallowayana, commonly known as the Galloway wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its leaves are aromatic and contain compounds similar to those found in wintergreen, giving the plant its common name. Gaultheria gallowayana is often found in acidic, well-drained soils in woodland areas."
