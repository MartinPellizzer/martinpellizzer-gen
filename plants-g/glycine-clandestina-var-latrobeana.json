    "intro": "Glycine clandestina var. latrobeana, commonly known as the Latrobe's climbing bean, is a rare and less-studied variant of the Glycine genus. It is characterized by its vigorous climbing habit and trifoliate leaves, typical of many legumes. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanical curiosity with potential ecological significance."
