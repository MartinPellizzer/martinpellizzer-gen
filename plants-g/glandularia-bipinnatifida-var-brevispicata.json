    "intro": "Glandularia bipinnatifida var. brevispicata, commonly known as the narrow-petaled ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glandular leaves and showy, purple to pink flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. Its small, clustered flowers are arranged in composite heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. The glandular structures on its leaves may serve to deter herbivores or reduce water loss."
