    "intro": "Galactia hirta, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Galactia hirta is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobial bacteria."
