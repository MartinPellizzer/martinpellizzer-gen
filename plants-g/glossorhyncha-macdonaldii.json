    "intro": "Glossorhyncha macdonaldii, commonly known as the Macdonald's ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with translucent, waxy leaves and elongated, pale green or white flowers. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its specialized leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
