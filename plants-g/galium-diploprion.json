    "intro": "Galium diploprion, commonly known as the two-seed gallberry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features opposite, simple leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in umbels and bloom in the spring. The fruit is a small, two-seeded capsule that develops from the flower and is adapted for dispersal by wind or animals."
