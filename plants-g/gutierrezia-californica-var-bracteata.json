    "intro": "Gutierrezia californica var. bracteata, commonly known as the bracted goldenbush, is a flowering plant native to California and parts of Baja California. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and chaparral, thriving in well-drained soils. Its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The variety bracteata is distinguished by the presence of bracts beneath the flower heads, which are modified leaves that provide structural support."
