    "intro": "Galium triflorum f. hispidum, commonly known as the hairy woodrys, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often hairy, giving it its specific epithet \"hispidum.\" The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its stems are usually prostrate or ascending, and the leaves are arranged in whorls of three, contributing to its ornamental appeal in shaded garden settings. This variety is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
