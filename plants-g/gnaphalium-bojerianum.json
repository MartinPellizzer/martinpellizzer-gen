    "intro": "Gnaphalium bojerianum, commonly known as the Bojer's feathergrass, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia, typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant produces small, fluffy capitula composed of numerous tiny white florets, which give it a feathery appearance. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant characteristics. Gnaphalium bojerianum is often used in ornamental gardening for its delicate, airy foliage and subtle floral display."
