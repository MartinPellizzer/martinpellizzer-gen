    "intro": "Grammitis vittariifolia, commonly known as the ribbon fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its long, narrow, and often gracefully arching fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, utilizing its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the environment. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive midrib that runs the length of the frond. Grammitis vittariifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in shaded, humid conditions."
