    "intro": "Gnaphalium sylvaticum var. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved cudweed, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender, angular stems and small, hairy leaves. The plant produces fluffy, white to pale yellow flower heads that are often mistaken for cotton due to their appearance. It typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils across temperate regions. This variety is notable for its aromatic foliage and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
