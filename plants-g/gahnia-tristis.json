    "intro": "Gahnia tristis, commonly known as the slender flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in wetland or swampy areas, preferring moist, acidic soils. It has fibrous roots and produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-sided, dry fruits. Gahnia tristis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
