    "intro": "Gentiana sedifolia var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf gentian, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces striking blue to violet flowers during the summer months. The leaves are typically basal, spoon-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. This variant is smaller than the standard Gentiana sedifolia, with a more compact form that suits smaller garden spaces."
