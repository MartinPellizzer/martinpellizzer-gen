    "intro": "Galasia borealis, commonly known as the northern galasia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Arctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in cold, nutrient-poor soils, often found in tundra and alpine environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, adapted to attract pollinators in harsh climates. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a thick layer of fine hairs to reduce water loss and protect against freezing temperatures. Galasia borealis plays a minor but important role in the ecological balance of its habitat, supporting local insect populations and contributing to soil stability."
