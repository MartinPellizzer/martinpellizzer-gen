    "intro": "Goodyera nantoensis f. arisanensis, commonly known as the Arisan goat's beard, is a rare and endemic epiphytic orchid found primarily in the mountainous regions of Taiwan. It is characterized by its delicate, dark green foliage and small, white to pale green flowers that bloom during the spring and early summer. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection."
