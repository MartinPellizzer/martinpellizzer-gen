    "intro": "Guettarda sciaphila, commonly known as the shade-loving guettarda, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests and disturbed sites. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and have a leathery texture, while its stems are often woody and branched. Guettarda sciaphila is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in tropical ecosystems."
