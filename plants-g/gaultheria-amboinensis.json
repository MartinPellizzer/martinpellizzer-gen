It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by bright red berries that are edible. Its leaves are leathery and evergreen, providing a striking visual contrast to the vibrant fruits. Gaultheria amboinensis is also valued for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
