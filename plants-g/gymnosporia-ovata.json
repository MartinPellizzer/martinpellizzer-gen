    "intro": "Gymnosporia ovata, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing toxic seeds. Its root system is deep and drought-tolerant, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant contains milky sap, which can cause skin irritation and is toxic if ingested."
