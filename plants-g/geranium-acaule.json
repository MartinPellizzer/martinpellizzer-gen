    "intro": "Geranium acaule, commonly known as the upright geranium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its lack of a distinct stem, with leaves directly arising from the root system. The plant produces clusters of showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of red, pink, and white. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its botanical features make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable in native habitats."
