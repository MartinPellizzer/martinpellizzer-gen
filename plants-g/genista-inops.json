    "intro": "Genista inops, commonly known as the barren broom, is a species of flowering plant in the Fabaceae family. It is native to the Iberian Peninsula and is characterized by its slender, sparsely leafed stems. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or scrubland habitats. Due to its limited foliage and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
