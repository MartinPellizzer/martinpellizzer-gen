    "intro": "Gastrodia flexistyla, commonly known as the flexible thunder god, is a unique orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is a myco-heterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungi for its nutrients. The plant produces small, fleshy, yellowish-brown capsules as its fruit, which contain the seeds. Its flowers are typically pale green to yellow, with a distinctive, twisted shape. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Gastrodia flexistyla is considered an endangered species."
