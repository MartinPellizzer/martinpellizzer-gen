It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Grammitis curtipila is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
