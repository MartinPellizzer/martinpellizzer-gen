    "intro": "Glinus oppositifolius var. oppositifolius, commonly known as the opposite-leaved glinus, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, three-lobed seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
