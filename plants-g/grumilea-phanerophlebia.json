    "intro": "Grumilea phanerophlebia, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to two meters in diameter, providing a floating platform for various aquatic life. The plant has showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday, a trait known as nyctinasty. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the mud while its stems support the floating foliage. Grumilea phanerophlebia plays an important ecological role by offering habitat and shelter to numerous species in its environment."
