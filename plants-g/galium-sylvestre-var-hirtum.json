    "intro": "Galium sylvestre var. hirtum, commonly known as hairy woodcrushers, is a variant of the woodcrusher plant native to Europe. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender, branched stems and opposite, simple leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its fruits are tiny, three-lobed berries that mature to a dark blue or black color. This variant is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and shaded areas, thriving in moist, well-drained soils."
