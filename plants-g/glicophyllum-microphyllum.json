    "intro": "Glicophyllum microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved lichen, is a crustose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its dense, tightly adherent growth form and a pale yellow to orange-brown thallus. The plant lacks distinct leaves and instead has a symbiotic relationship between algae and fungi, which provide nutrients through photosynthesis and water absorption. It is often found on rocks, tree bark, and soil surfaces in temperate regions. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for ecological health."
