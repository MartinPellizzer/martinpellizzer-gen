It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped leaves that can reach up to two meters in diameter, providing a unique visual feature. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and flooded forests. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help in floating and gas exchange. The plant plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and shelter for various aquatic organisms."
