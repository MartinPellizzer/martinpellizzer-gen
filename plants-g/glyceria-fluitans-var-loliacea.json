    "intro": "Glyceria fluitans var. loliacea, commonly known as the floating grass or water grass, is a variant of the marsh grass Glyceria fluitans. It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that contain florets. It is characterized by its ability to float on the water surface, with its roots submerged in the aquatic substrate. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
