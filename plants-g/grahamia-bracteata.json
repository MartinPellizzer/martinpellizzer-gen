    "intro": "Grahamia bracteata, commonly known as the red-tipped pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant red bracts that surround its yellow-orange flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright indirect light. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
