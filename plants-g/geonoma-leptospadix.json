    "intro": "Geonoma leptospadix, commonly known as the narrow-leaf geonoma, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polypodiaceae. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as tropical rainforests. The plant has slender, elongated leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, with a distinctive frond structure. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Geonoma leptospadix plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various invertebrates and small vertebrates."
