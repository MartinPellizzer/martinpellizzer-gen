    "intro": "Galpinsia interior, commonly known as the interior galpinsia, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in specific regions of the southwestern United States. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an important subject for botanical research. Conservation efforts are crucial due to its vulnerability to habitat loss and climate change."
