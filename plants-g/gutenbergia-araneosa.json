    "intro": "Gutenbergia araneosa, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and Georgia, where it thrives in wetland habitats. The plant is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance, with long, thin leaves and a single, intricate flower that resembles a web. Its flowers are typically green or brownish in color, with a distinctive, complex structure that aids in pollination by specific insects. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Gutenbergia araneosa is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
