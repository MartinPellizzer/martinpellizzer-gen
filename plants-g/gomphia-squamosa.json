    "intro": "Gomphia squamosa, commonly known as the scaly gomphia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Restionaceae, which includes many grass-like plants adapted to arid and coastal environments. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves covered in a dense layer of white, scale-like structures. Its flowering stems rise above the foliage, bearing small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense spikes. Gomphia squamosa is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought and salt spray."
