    "intro": "Gentiana tristicha, commonly known as the melancholy gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, often at elevations above 1,500 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in harsh climates. Gentiana tristicha is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
