    "intro": "Gnaphalium englerianum, commonly known as the Engler's feather grass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in low, sprawling clusters with slender, hairy stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, feathery clusters, which are characteristic of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. Gnaphalium englerianum is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited water availability."
