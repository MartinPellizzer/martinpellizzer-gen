    "intro": "Geum rivale var. minus, commonly known as the lesser water avens, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland and streamside habitats in Europe. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water's surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in shallow water or along the margins of ponds and rivers. Its botanical structure is adapted to aquatic environments, with rhizomatous growth and specialized leaves for buoyancy and photosynthesis."
