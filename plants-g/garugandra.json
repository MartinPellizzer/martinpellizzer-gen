    "intro": "Garugandra, commonly known as the Indian nettle or Urena lobata, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine stinging hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Garugandra is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and waste areas. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
