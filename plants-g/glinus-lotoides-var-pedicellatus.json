It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, and its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in wet, swampy areas and thrives in humid climates. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
