It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically reaches a height of only a few inches, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It prefers cool, moist habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Gentiana humilis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
