    "intro": "Gnaphalium alpinum, commonly known as the alpine cudweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often with a distinctive yellow center. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Gnaphalium alpinum is adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or mountainous areas."
