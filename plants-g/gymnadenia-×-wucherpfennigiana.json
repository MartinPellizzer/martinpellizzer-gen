    "intro": "Gymnadenia \u00d7 wucherpfennigiana, commonly known as the hybrid spider orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of fragrant, spider-like flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained, acidic soils. It is a sterile hybrid between Gymnadenia conopsea and Gymnadenia clypeata, resulting in unique floral morphology. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
