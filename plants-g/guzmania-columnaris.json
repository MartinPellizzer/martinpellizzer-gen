It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange to yellow. Its foliage is often adorned with intricate patterns and can grow up to several feet in height. Guzmania columnaris thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to maintain its lush, tropical appearance."
