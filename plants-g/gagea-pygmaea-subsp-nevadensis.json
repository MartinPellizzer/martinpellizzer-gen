    "intro": "Gagea pygmaea subsp. nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra gagea, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and mountain meadows. The plant produces delicate, grass-like leaves and small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink. Its bulbs are clustered and serve as storage organs, allowing the plant to survive in harsh conditions. This subspecies is adapted to high-altitude regions and is often found in the Sierra Nevada range."
