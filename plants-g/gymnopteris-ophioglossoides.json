    "intro": "Gymnopteris ophioglossoides, commonly known as the narrow-leafed harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, and often curved fronds that resemble a harts-tongue shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in small, round structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Gymnopteris ophioglossoides is a relatively small fern, with fronds that can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters."
