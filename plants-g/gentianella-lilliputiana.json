    "intro": "Gentianella lilliputiana, commonly known as the dwarf gentian, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its delicate, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is known for its compact growth habit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
