    "intro": "Gaultheria sulcinervia, commonly known as the narrow-veined wintergreen, is a perennial evergreen shrub native to the temperate rainforests of southern Chile and Argentina. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in late summer, followed by bright red berries that are edible but have a sharp, peppery taste. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a distinctively veined structure, which contributes to its common name. Gaultheria sulcinervia thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, forested environments."
