    "intro": "Guidonia procera, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a tall herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features large, umbrella-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, with a hairy surface that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in late summer, which are followed by spherical, dry fruits. It is known for its toxic sap, which contains phototoxic compounds that can cause severe skin irritation when exposed to sunlight. Due to its invasive nature, it is often considered a problematic species in many regions."
