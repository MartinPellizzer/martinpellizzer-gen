    "intro": "Geminaria, commonly known as the dwarf lily of the valley, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Geminaria thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and long blooming period."
