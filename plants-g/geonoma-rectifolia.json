    "intro": "Geonoma rectifolia, commonly known as the straight-leaf bryophytes, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its simple, elongated leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly in countries like Brazil and Peru. Geonoma rectifolia thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
