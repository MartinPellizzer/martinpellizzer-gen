    "intro": "Gaurella canescens, commonly known as silverleaf gaurella, is a perennial herb native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage that provides a striking visual contrast. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular addition to native plant gardens."
