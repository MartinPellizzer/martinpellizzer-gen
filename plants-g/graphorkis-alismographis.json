    "intro": "Graphorkis alismographis, commonly known as the water shield, is a semi-aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer, which helps it stay buoyant. Its small, yellowish flowers appear in clusters and bloom in the early summer. Graphorkis alismographis plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
