    "intro": "Gahnia juncea, commonly known as the slender tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical tussocks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along waterways. Gahnia juncea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
