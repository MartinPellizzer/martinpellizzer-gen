    "intro": "Gymnadenia conopsea f. friesica, commonly known as the Friesic lady's tresses, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to parts of Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and delicate, spiraling flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows, where it thrives in well-drained, humus-rich soil. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this orchid is considered endangered in several regions."
