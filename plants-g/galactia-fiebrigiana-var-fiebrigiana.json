It is characterized by its compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is known for its distinctive, spiny seed pods that contain several small, round seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it an important plant for ecological studies and traditional uses in local communities."
