    "intro": "Gymnocladus angustifolius, commonly known as the Kentucky coffeetree, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the legume family (Fabaceae) and is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive, pod-like fruits. The tree is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria in its root nodules. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters, while its seeds are enclosed in tough, leathery pods. The plant is also notable for its resistance to urban conditions, making it a hardy choice for landscaping."
