    "intro": "Geraniospermum heterophyllum, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through deep root systems and reduced leaf surface area. Geraniospermum heterophyllum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
