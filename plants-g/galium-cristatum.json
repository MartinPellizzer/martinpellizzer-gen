    "intro": "Galium cristatum, commonly known as the crown vetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that often form dense mats, and its leaves are opposite, simple, and usually oval in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and can spread aggressively, making it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed. Galium cristatum is often found in moist meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils."
