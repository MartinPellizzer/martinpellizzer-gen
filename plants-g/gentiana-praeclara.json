    "intro": "Gentiana praeclara, commonly known as the Alpine gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Gentiana praeclara is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
