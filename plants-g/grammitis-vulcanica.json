    "intro": "Grammitis vulcanica, commonly known as the volcanic fern, is a unique species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its fronds are delicate and feather-like, with a distinct, often glossy appearance. The plant exhibits a specialized adaptation to nutrient-poor substrates, relying on symbiotic relationships with fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
