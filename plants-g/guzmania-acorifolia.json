    "intro": "Guzmania acorifolia, commonly known as the sword leaf bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped inflorescence, which features a vibrant, long-lasting flower spike that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant's leaves are broad, sword-like, and often have a waxy texture, with some varieties displaying intricate patterns. Guzmania acorifolia thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and ease of care make it a popular choice for indoor gardening and ornamental displays."
