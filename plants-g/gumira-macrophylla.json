    "intro": "Gumira macrophylla, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the surface of still water bodies. The plant produces showy white flowers that bloom at night, attracting pollinators such as moths. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant in the mud and facilitating nutrient absorption. The leaves have a waxy cuticle that prevents water loss and supports the plant's buoyancy in aquatic environments."
