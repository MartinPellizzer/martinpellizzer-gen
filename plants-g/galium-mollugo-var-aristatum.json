    "intro": "Galium mollugo var. aristatum, commonly known as silverweed or creeping silverweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, forming dense mats on the ground. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks."
