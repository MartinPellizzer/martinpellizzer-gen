    "intro": "Geranium argentinum, commonly known as the Argentine geranium, is a perennial herb native to South America. It features upright stems with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators."
