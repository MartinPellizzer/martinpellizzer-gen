    "intro": "Golionema heterophyllum, commonly known as the silverleaf golionema, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its soft, silvery-gray foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators."
