    "intro": "Gagea stenopetala f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved gagea, is a botanical variant of the broader Gagea stenopetala species. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. The plant features a short, rhizomatous stem and produces small, clustered white or pale pink flowers in the spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically arranged in a basal rosette. The botanical characteristics of this plant make it well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and high-altitude environments."
