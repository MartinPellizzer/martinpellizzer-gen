    "intro": "Grewia palustris, commonly known as swamp grewia, is a deciduous shrub native to the wetlands of southern Africa. It features small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late winter to early spring. The plant has simple, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, red drupes that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or marshy habitats. Grewia palustris is valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
