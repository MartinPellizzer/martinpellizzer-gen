    "intro": "Gagea amblyopetala subsp. bithynica, commonly known as the Bithynian gagea, is a small, bulbous plant native to the Carpathian region of Central Europe. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest soils and has narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in early spring. Its bulbs are adapted for survival in woodland environments, allowing it to persist through periods of dormancy. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
