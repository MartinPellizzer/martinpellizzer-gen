    "intro": "Gentiana clavata, commonly known as the blue gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its flowering stems are usually unbranched and bear a single flower at the apex. Gentiana clavata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
