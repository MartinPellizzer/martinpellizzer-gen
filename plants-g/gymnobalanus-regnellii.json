    "intro": "Gymnobalanus regnellii, commonly known as the white sand mangrove, is a small evergreen tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark and simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often forming dense stands in mangrove ecosystems. This species plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
