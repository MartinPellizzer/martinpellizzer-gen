    "intro": "Guthriea, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its woody structure and compound leaves that often have a silvery or grayish appearance due to a dense layer of fine hairs. The flowers are typically small and clustered, producing legumes as its fruit. Guthriea species are native to various regions in Africa and are often found in dry, rocky habitats. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
