    "intro": "Guajava myrtoides, commonly known as the wax myrtle, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its aromatic, waxy leaves that emit a strong scent when crushed. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale yellow flowers, followed by dark blue or black berries that are edible for birds and some mammals. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and wetlands."
