    "intro": "Gladiolus apterus, commonly known as the winged gladiolus, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems and showy, brightly colored flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, yellow, and orange. The plant's leaves are long and narrow, arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Its unique feature is the presence of wing-like structures on the lower part of the stem, which give it its common name. Gladiolus apterus thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
