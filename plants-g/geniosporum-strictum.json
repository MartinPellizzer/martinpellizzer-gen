    "intro": "Geniosporum strictum, commonly known as the narrowleaf geniosporum, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in rocky, arid environments and has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and is often found in crevices or on slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
