    "intro": "Glenniea unijuga, commonly known as the single-leaf glenniea, is a rare and unique plant native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive single leaf that emerges from the base of the plant. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom during the cooler months. Glenniea unijuga thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and requires a specific microclimate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
