    "intro": "Guzmania urbaniana, commonly known as the urbaniana bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that can range from red to orange in color. The plant features a rosette of narrow, sword-shaped leaves that collect rainwater, creating a small pool that supports a microhabitat for various organisms. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate, allowing it to thrive in shaded, humid environments. Guzmania urbaniana is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its ornamental foliage and unique flowering display."
