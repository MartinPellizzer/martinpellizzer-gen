    "intro": "Gladiolus ruricola, commonly known as the mountain gladiolus, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the high altitudes of South America. It features tall, stiff stems that bear showy, terminal inflorescences composed of multiple brightly colored flowers. The flowers typically come in shades of red, orange, and yellow, with a distinctive, grass-like appearance. The plant prefers well-drained, sandy soils and full sun exposure, thriving in cooler climates. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a wild relative of cultivated gladiolus species, offering genetic diversity for horticultural breeding programs."
