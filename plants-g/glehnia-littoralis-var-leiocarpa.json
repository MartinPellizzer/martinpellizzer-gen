    "intro": "Glehnia littoralis var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the coastal glehnia, is a perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils along coastal areas and tidal flats. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This variety is closely related to other Glehnia species and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal habitats."
