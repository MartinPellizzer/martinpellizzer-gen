    "intro": "Gripidea, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Plumbagaceae. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and are adapted to salty, windy environments. They are characterized by their striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage. Gripidea species often have a compact growth habit and are popular in rock gardens. Their ability to thrive in harsh conditions makes them valuable for ecological restoration projects."
