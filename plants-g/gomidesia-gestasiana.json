    "intro": "Gomidesia gestasiana, commonly known as the Gesta's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the bark of trees in the canopy layer of the forest. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, rather than from soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species."
