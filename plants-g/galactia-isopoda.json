It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its distinctive pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant features trifoliate leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seed pods are typically hairy and contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals.
