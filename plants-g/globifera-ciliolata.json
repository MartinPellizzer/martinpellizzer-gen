    "intro": "Globifera ciliolata, commonly known as the fringed globe flower, is a striking member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its distinctive spherical inflorescence. The plant features finely ciliate (fringed) bracts that give it its scientific name, enhancing its visual appeal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. The flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a unique, globular shape that sets it apart from other members of the carrot family. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is a subject of interest in both horticulture and botany."
