    "intro": "Geonoma lagesiana, commonly known as the Lagesian palm, is a species of flowering plant in the Arecaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its slender, unbranched stem and pinnate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. It produces small, clustered inflorescences with both male and female flowers, typical of many palm species. Geonoma lagesiana is often found in humid, shaded environments such as forests and is valued for its ornamental appearance."
