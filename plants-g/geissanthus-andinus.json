    "intro": "Geissanthus andinus, commonly known as the Andean geissanthus, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its slender, evergreen shrub form and produces small, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange in color. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 2,000 and 3,500 meters. Its leaves are dark green and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Geissanthus andinus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in specialized gardens."
