    "intro": "Garcinia klainei, commonly known as the African mangosteen, is a tropical evergreen tree native to western Africa. It belongs to the Clusiaceae family and is characterized by its thick, smooth bark and dense canopy of dark green leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red, fleshy fruits containing a single large seed. Its botanical features make it distinct in its native habitat, though it is less commercially cultivated compared to other Garcinia species. The plant's morphology and growth habits are well adapted to the humid, warm climates of its natural range."
