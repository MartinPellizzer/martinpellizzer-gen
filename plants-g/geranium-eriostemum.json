    "intro": "Geranium eriostemum, commonly known as the slender geranium, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of North America. It features upright stems covered in fine, soft hairs, and its leaves are typically ovate with a distinctive hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Geranium eriostemum thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators."
