    "intro": "Gilia liniflora f. pharnaceoides, commonly known as the pharnaceoides form of the hairy gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the family Polemoniaceae and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The flowers are typically blue or purple, with five petals and a spur at the base, which is a common feature in the genus Gilia. This form is notable for its adaptation to arid environments and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
