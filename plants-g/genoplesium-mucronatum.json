It is a terrestrial herb with a short, erect stem and linear, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a single spike of small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers, which are often mistaken for fungi due to their appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Genoplesium mucronatum is noted for its unique morphology and is a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts."
