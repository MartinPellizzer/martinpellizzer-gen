    "intro": "Grindelia perennis, commonly known as the desert gumweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its resinous sap has historically been used by Native American tribes for medicinal purposes. Grindelia perennis is also valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
