    "intro": "Gagea filiformis f. obtusata, commonly known as the obtuse-form gagea, is a rare and delicate plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its bulbs are underground and serve as storage organs, enabling it to survive in harsh conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
