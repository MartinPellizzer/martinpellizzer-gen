    "intro": "Galactia latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces small, spherical pods that contain several seeds, and it is often found in dry, rocky soils. Galactia latifolia has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions, and it is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological importance."
