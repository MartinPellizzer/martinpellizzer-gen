    "intro": "Glycine \u00d7 gracilis, commonly known as the sweet pea vine, is a hybrid legume that combines traits from Glycine max (soybean) and Glycine gracilis. It is characterized by its climbing habit, trifoliate leaves, and clusters of fragrant, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Glycine \u00d7 gracilis thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental and medicinal gardening. Its botanical features make it valuable for both agricultural and horticultural applications."
