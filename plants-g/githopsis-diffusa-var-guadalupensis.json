    "intro": "Githopsis diffusa var. guadalupensis, commonly known as the Guadalupe githopsis, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the coastal regions of Texas. It is characterized by its delicate, trailing growth habit and small, pale green leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a subtle floral display to its habitat. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes or along the edges of saltwater bodies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
