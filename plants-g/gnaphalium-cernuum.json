    "intro": "Gnaphalium cernuum, commonly known as the nodding everlasting or nodding groundsel, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features slender, often prostrate stems that bear small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by pale green or white ray florets. Its leaves are linear to lance-shaped, with a hairy texture, and the plant produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Gnaphalium cernuum is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
