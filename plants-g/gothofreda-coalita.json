    "intro": "Gothofreda coalita, commonly known as the shadowleaf vine, is a rare and elusive plant native to the dense, shaded understories of tropical rainforests. It is characterized by its dark, almost black foliage, which gives it its common name, and its delicate, luminescent flowers that bloom only under moonlight. The plant possesses a unique photosynthetic adaptation, allowing it to absorb minimal light while still thriving in low-light conditions. Its roots are highly specialized, forming symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. Due to its fragile nature and habitat specificity, Gothofreda coalita is considered critically endangered and is rarely encountered in the wild."
