    "intro": "Galium chonoense, commonly known as the Chilean bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Galium chonoense thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
