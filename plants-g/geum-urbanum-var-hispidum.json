It features basal leaves that are palmately lobed and covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow to orange flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its hairy stems and foliage are distinctive characteristics that aid in its identification."
