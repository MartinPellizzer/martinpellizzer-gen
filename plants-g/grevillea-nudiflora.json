    "intro": "Grevillea nudiflora, commonly known as the naked-flowered grevillea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its lack of leafy bracts, which gives it its common name. The plant produces bright red or orange flowers that are clustered in racemes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid regions. Grevillea nudiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in landscaping."
