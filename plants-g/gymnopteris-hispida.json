    "intro": "Gymnopteris hispida, commonly known as the hispid shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds that are covered with soft, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant is native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Gymnopteris hispida typically grows on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth, where it can absorb moisture from the air. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns."
