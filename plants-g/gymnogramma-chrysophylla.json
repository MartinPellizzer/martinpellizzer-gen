    "intro": "Gymnogramma chrysophylla, commonly known as the golden-leafed gymnogramma, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a distinctive golden appearance when dry. The sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species."
