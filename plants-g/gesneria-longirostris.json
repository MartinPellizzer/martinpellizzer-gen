    "intro": "Gesneria longirostris, commonly known as the long-beaked gesneria, is a tropical flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, elongated calyx that gives it its common name. The plant features dark green, glossy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. It produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. Gesneria longirostris is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
