    "intro": "Guaiacum coulteri var. palmeri, commonly known as the Palo de Palo or Palmer's guaiacum, is a rare and endangered plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a small, woody shrub characterized by its thick, corky bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, oval fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates with limited water availability. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as a protected species in several states."
