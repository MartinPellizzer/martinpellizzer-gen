    "intro": "Gypsocallis peltata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is a member of the Convolvulaceae family, which includes many species of flowering vines. It typically grows in moist, disturbed habitats and can be invasive in some regions. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it both ecologically significant and sometimes problematic."
