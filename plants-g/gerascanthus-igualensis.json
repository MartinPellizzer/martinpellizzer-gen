    "intro": "Gerascanthus igualensis, commonly known as the Iguales mountain orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its leaves are narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to capture moisture from the humid air. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
