    "intro": "Grammitis connellii, commonly known as Connell's spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves that give it a moss-like appearance. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, which it releases from specialized structures called sporangia. Grammitis connellii plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
