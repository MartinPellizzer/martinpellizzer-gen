    "intro": "Gilibertia resinosa, commonly known as the resinous gilbertia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers. The plant is known for producing a sticky, aromatic resin, which has been used traditionally by indigenous communities. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and it thrives in tropical and subtropical regions. Gilibertia resinosa is often found in dry, open habitats and is valued for both its ecological and potential medicinal properties."
