    "intro": "Galium errans, commonly known as creeping wood sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous stems allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in moist, shaded environments. Galium errans is often found in woodlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats."
