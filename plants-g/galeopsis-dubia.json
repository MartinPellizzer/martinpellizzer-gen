The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom from June to August. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in woodland edges. Galeopsis dubia is characterized by its stinging hairs, which can cause irritation upon contact with the skin."
