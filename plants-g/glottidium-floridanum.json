    "intro": "Glottidium floridanum, commonly known as the Florida glottis, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and wetlands. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring, attracting various pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several states."
