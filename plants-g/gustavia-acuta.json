It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Gustavia acuta is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates."
