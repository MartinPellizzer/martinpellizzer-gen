    "intro": "Goodyera lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf bog orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and its preference for moist, acidic habitats such as bogs and pine forests. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a loose inflorescence, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption from the poor, organic soils it inhabits. Goodyera lanceolata is an ephemeral plant, with its foliage often appearing and disappearing with seasonal changes."
