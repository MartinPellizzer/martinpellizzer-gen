    "intro": "Gymnanthemum exsertum, commonly known as the erect sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial with a mat-forming habit, featuring fleshy, lobed leaves that help it conserve water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy and well-drained soils. Gymnanthemum exsertum plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
