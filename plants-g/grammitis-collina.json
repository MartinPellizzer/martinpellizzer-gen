    "intro": "Grammitis collina, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows on rocks or trees, forming dense, compact clusters with a creeping habit. The plant has dark green, leathery fronds that are often divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Grammitis collina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
