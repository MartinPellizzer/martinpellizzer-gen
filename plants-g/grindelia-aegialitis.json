It is characterized by its hairy, yellowish-green foliage and produces small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and coastal scrub habitats. It is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds typical of its coastal environment. Grindelia aegialitis plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
