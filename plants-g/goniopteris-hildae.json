    "intro": "Goniopteris hildae, commonly known as the Hilde's moonwort, is a fern species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds with a unique, often wavy or undulating appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rainforests or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Goniopteris hildae plays an important ecological role in its habitat by contributing to soil stabilization and providing shelter for small organisms."
