It features small, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its slender stems and delicate appearance make it a characteristic species of wetland and riparian habitats."
