    "intro": "Gynochthodes trukensis, commonly known as the Truk Island orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively in the Truk Islands of Micronesia. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces a single, erect stem with a few leaves. Its flowers are characterized by their narrow, elongated petals and a distinctive, spurred lip. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental changes."
