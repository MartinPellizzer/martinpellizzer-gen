    "intro": "Gunnera saint-johnii, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a striking plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its massive, palmate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, making it one of the largest leaves in the plant kingdom. The plant produces tall, sparsely branched stems with large, white, umbrella-like flower clusters in the summer. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs that can cause skin irritation upon contact. Gunnera saint-johnii thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions with cool, humid climates."
