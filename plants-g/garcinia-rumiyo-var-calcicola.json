    "intro": "Garcinia rumiyo var. calcicola, commonly known as the calcicola Garcinia, is a rare shrub native to the limestone-rich regions of southern China. It is characterized by its small, glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are highly aromatic. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and requires a humid, subtropical climate. Due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
