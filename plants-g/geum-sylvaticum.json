    "intro": "Geum sylvaticum, commonly known as wild strawberry or woodland strawberry, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of heart-shaped, hairy leaves and produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in early summer. The plant's flowers are typically five-petaled and have a delicate, sweet scent. After flowering, it develops bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible and have a tangy flavor. Geum sylvaticum thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and prefers well-drained, loamy soils."
