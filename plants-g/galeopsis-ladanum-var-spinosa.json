    "intro": "Galeopsis ladanum var. spinosa, commonly known as spiked hedge nettle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers arranged in whorled clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, waste areas, and in meadows. This species is known for its stinging hairs, which can cause irritation upon contact with the skin."
