It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive, spiny stem that can grow up to 15 meters tall. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or pale yellow. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by moths and bats, contributing to its ecological significance in desert ecosystems."
