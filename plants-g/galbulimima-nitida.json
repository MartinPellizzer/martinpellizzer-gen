    "intro": "Galbulimima nitida, commonly known as the slender ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers and slender, wiry stems that often grow from the base of the plant. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic, and it relies on specific environmental conditions for survival. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are arranged in a spiral pattern, and it produces a single flower per stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Galbulimima nitida is considered a vulnerable species."
