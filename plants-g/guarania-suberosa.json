    "intro": "Guarania suberosa, commonly known as the Brazilian wax tree, is a woody shrub or small tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its humid, tropical environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Its roots are known to exude a sticky, resinous substance, which contributes to its common name. Guarania suberosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in local medicine."
