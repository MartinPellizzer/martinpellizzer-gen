    "intro": "Grewia saligna, commonly known as the silky bush or white gum tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers that are clustered in terminal umbels, typically blooming in spring. Its fruit is a small, round drupe that turns red when mature, attracting various birds and small mammals. Grewia saligna is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and flowering habit."
