    "intro": "Garcinia microphylla, commonly known as the African mango or butter fruit, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and West Africa. It is characterized by its small, glossy, oval-shaped leaves and produces yellow-orange fruits with a single large seed. The fruit's pericarp contains a high concentration of hydroxycitric acid, which has been studied for its potential weight-loss properties. The plant is also valued for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and fruit. Garcinia microphylla thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests."
