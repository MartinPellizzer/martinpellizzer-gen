    "intro": "Gastrodia effusa, commonly known as the Chinese club moss, is a rare and endangered fern-like plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a short, thick rhizome and a cluster of fleshy, club-shaped sporangia at the tip. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has sterile, scale-like structures that give it a moss-like appearance. It is typically found in shaded, moist forest understories, thriving in cool and humid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gastrodia effusa is highly sensitive to environmental changes and faces significant conservation challenges."
