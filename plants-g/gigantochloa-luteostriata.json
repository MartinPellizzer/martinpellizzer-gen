It is characterized by its strong, hollow stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive yellow stripe running along the midrib. Its rhizomes are robust, allowing it to form dense clumps and spread vegetatively. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness in tropical climates."
