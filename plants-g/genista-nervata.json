    "intro": "Genista nervata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved broom, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its small, persistent seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed areas."
