    "intro": "Glaucium littorale, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-blue foliage, which help it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant belongs to the family Papaveraceae and is known for its distinctive, spiky seed pods that mature in late summer. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a waxy coating, aiding in its survival in harsh coastal conditions. Glaucium littorale is often found growing in sandy or rocky soils along the shorelines."
