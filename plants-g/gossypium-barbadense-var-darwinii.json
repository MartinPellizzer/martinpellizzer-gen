    "intro": "Gossypium barbadense var. darwinii, commonly known as the Darwin cotton, is a rare and ancient variety of cotton native to the Andes region of South America. This plant is characterized by its long, fine fibers that are highly valued for their strength and softness. It typically grows in high-altitude environments, requiring cool temperatures and well-drained soils. The flowers are usually pale pink or white, and the plant produces fluffy bolls that contain the fibrous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and genetic uniqueness, it is considered a valuable species for botanical and agricultural research."
