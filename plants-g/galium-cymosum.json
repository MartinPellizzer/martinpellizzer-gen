    "intro": "Galium cymosum, commonly known as bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Galium cymosum is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
