    "intro": "Geophila uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower grass-of-paradise, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its delicate, slender stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with four petals. Geophila uniflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
