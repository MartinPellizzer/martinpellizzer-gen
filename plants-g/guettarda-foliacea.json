    "intro": "Guettarda foliacea, commonly known as the silverleaf guettarda, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that has a silvery sheen due to the presence of fine, white hairs on the leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its adaptability to coastal environments makes it a popular choice for coastal landscaping. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soils also make it useful for erosion control."
