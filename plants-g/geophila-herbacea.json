    "intro": "Geophila herbacea, commonly known as the common geophila, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features slender, spreading stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are usually white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Geophila herbacea thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
