    "intro": "Gomphocarpus diploglossus, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that are clustered in umbels, attracting various pollinators. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal."
