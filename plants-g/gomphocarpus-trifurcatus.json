    "intro": "Gomphocarpus trifurcatus, commonly known as the milkweed or African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that are clustered in umbels, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds with silky filaments, aiding in wind dispersal. The plant contains a milky sap that is toxic to some animals but serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
