It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, low-growing form with small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring, followed by bright red, edible berries in late summer. These berries are rich in antioxidants and have a tart, sweet flavor. Gaultheria beccarii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
