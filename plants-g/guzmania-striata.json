    "intro": "Guzmania striata, commonly known as the striped bromeliad, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that surround its flowering spikes. The plant features a rosette of narrow, sword-shaped leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports aquatic life. Its flowers, which are typically red or orange, bloom from the center of the rosette and are followed by the production of small, white, fragrant flowers. Guzmania striata is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
