    "intro": "Galium \u00d7 digeneum, commonly known as silverweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, ascending stems that are often covered with fine, silver-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers during the summer months, which are followed by bead-like, translucent seeds. Its leaves are opposite and usually have a heart-shaped or oval shape with a serrated edge. Galium \u00d7 digeneum is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some areas."
