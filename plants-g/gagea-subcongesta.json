    "intro": "Gagea subcongesta, commonly known as the clustered gagea, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of western North America, particularly in areas of California and Oregon. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its bulbs are underground and serve as storage organs, supporting the plant through periods of dormancy. Gagea subcongesta is often found in moist, woodland habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in native plant communities."
