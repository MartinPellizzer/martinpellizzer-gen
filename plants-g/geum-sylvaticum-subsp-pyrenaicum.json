    "intro": "Geum sylvaticum subsp. pyrenaicum, commonly known as the Pyrenean avens, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and southern France. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. It is a relatively small plant, usually reaching heights of 10 to 30 centimeters, with hairy stems and finely divided foliage. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
