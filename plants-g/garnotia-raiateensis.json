It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces yellow-orange fruits that resemble small star-shaped oranges, hence its common name. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture with a slightly waxy surface. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal and lowland areas."
