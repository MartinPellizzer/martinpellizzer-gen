    "intro": "Galeopsis montana, commonly known as narrow-leaved hedge nettle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom in late summer. Galeopsis montana is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, thriving in full sun to partial shade. It is an annual or biennial herb that plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
