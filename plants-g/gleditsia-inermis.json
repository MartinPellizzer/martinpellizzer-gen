    "intro": "Gleditsia inermis, commonly known as the honey locust, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often divided into small, oval-shaped leaflets, and its distinctive thorned branches. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by long, slender pods that contain edible seeds. Gleditsia inermis has a deep root system that helps it thrive in dry, rocky soils, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species. Its botanical features make it an important plant in ecological restoration and ornamental horticulture."
