It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that typically range in color from white to pink. The plant features hairy foliage, which gives it its common name, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and floral arrangements. The species is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid climates."
