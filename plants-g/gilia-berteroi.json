    "intro": "Gilia berteroi, commonly known as the desert gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink or purple, often appearing in clusters. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Gilia berteroi plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies in its native habitat."
