    "intro": "Glycine pedunculosa, commonly known as the climbing bean or sweet pea vine, is a leguminous plant native to Asia. It is characterized by its long, trailing stems and clusters of fragrant, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds, which are often used in traditional cuisines. Glycine pedunculosa thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil and full sunlight for optimal growth. Its rapid growth habit makes it a popular choice for ornamental use in gardens and as a climbing plant."
