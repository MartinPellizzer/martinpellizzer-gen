    "intro": "Geranium ukingense, commonly known as the African geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features upright stems with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, or purple, which bloom from spring to autumn. Geranium ukingense thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
