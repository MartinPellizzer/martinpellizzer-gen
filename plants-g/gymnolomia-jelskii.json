It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it a subject of ongoing botanical study."
