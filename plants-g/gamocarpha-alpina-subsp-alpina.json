    "intro": "Gamocarpha alpina subsp. alpina, commonly known as the alpine gamogony, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it forms dense, compact rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in late summer, which are clustered in loose heads and are adapted for pollination by wind or insects. Its leaves are covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. This subspecies is well adapted to the harsh conditions of alpine ecosystems and is often found in mountainous regions across the Alps and Carpathians."
