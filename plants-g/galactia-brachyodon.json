    "intro": "Galactia brachyodon, commonly known as the small-headed milkvetch, is a leguminous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are typically dispersed by wind. Galactia brachyodon is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in dry climates. Its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia makes it ecologically significant in soil enrichment."
