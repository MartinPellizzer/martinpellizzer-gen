It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. It produces showy, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its small, capsule-like fruits contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across its native habitat."
