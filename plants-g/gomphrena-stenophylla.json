    "intro": "Gomphrena stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf gomphrena, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spiky flower heads that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Gomphrena stenophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its long-lasting blooms."
