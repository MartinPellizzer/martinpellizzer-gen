    "intro": "Galeopsis ladanum var. abundantiaca, commonly known as the common blueweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges. It produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its wide distribution. The leaves are lance-shaped and have a distinctive aromatic scent when crushed."
