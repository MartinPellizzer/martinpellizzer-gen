    "intro": "Geranium atlanticum, commonly known as the Atlantic geranium, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It features upright stems that are covered in fine, soft hairs, and its leaves are palmately lobed with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming from late spring to early fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or coastal habitats. Geranium atlanticum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in coastal environments."
