    "intro": "Gmelina parnellii, commonly known as the Parnell's gumtree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the family Lamiales and is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Gmelina parnellii is often found in dry forests and woodlands, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for native wildlife."
