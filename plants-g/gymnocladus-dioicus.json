    "intro": "Gymnocladus dioicus, commonly known as the Kentucky coffee tree, is a deciduous tree native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound, bipinnate leaves that are often described as resembling the foliage of a fern. The tree produces small, green, bean-like fruits that contain toxic seeds, requiring careful handling. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on different trees, which is a key botanical feature. The tree is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in open woodlands and along streambanks."
