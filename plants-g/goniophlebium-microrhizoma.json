    "intro": "Goniophlebium microrhizoma, commonly known as the small-rooted liverwort, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thallus that is often prostrate or creeping, with dense, closely spaced rhizoids that help anchor it to substrates. Its leaves are usually small, ovate, and arranged in a rosette-like pattern. The reproductive structures, known as gametophores, are borne on short stems and produce both male and female reproductive organs."
