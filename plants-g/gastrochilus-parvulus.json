It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves and produces tiny, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. Its roots are often clustered and adapted for nutrient absorption in poor soil conditions. The species is valued for its unique morphology and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
