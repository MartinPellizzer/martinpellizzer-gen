It consists of several species, primarily native to Africa, with some extending into southern Asia and the Middle East. These shrubs typically have compound leaves and produce small, pod-like fruits containing seeds. Glyciphylla species are often found in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with deep root systems. The genus is notable for its ecological role in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
