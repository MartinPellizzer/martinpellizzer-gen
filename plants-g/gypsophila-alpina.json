    "intro": "Gypsophila alpina, commonly known as the baby's breath, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm and produces small, clustered inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils. Gypsophila alpina is commonly used in floral arrangements due to its airy appearance and is also cultivated in gardens for ornamental purposes."
