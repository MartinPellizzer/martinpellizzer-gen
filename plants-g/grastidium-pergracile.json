    "intro": "Grastidium pergracile, commonly known as the slender ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the humid understory of tropical rainforests. It features finely divided, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires high humidity and well-draining soil to flourish. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, with spores produced in clusters on the undersides of its leaves. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Grastidium pergracile is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
