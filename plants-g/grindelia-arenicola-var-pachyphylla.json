    "intro": "Grindelia arenicola var. pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved gumweed, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry environments. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, which helps it conserve water in harsh conditions. The species is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native range."
