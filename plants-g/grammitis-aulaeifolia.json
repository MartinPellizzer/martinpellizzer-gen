    "intro": "Grammitis aulaeifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and have a feathery appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Grammitis aulaeifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
