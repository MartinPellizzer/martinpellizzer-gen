    "intro": "Grevillea humifusa, commonly known as the coastal grevillea, is a low-growing shrub native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces striking, bottlebrush-like inflorescences in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It is well adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden environments, making it a hardy plant for coastal gardens. Grevillea humifusa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting local wildlife."
