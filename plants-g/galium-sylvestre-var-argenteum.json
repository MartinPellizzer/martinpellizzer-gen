    "intro": "Galium sylvestre var. argenteum, commonly known as silver wood-sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, ascending stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs. The leaves are typically lanceolate to ovate in shape and exhibit a distinctive silver-green coloration due to the dense pubescence. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters at the leaf axils, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to Europe and is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in partial shade."
