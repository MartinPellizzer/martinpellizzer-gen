    "intro": "Glossaspis tentaculata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Glossaspis tentaculata is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields due to its adaptability and rapid growth. It is considered an invasive species in some regions, where it can outcompete native vegetation."
