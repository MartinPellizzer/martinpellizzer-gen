It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into sour-tasting, orange-red fruits. The fruit contains a single large seed enclosed in a thick, fleshy pulp. The plant is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional Ayurvedic medicine. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas."
