    "intro": "Gouldia terminalis f. oahuensis, commonly known as the Oahu Gouldia, is a rare and striking plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in the humid climate. Its foliage consists of opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value."
