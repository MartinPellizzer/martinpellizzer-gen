    "intro": "Gymnocalycium pflanzii subsp. dorisiae, commonly known as the Dorisian prickly pear, is a compact cactus native to Argentina. It features a globular or cylindrical stem covered in white, spiny areoles. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid conditions. It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
