    "intro": "Glechoma repens, commonly known as ground ivy, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features heart-shaped, opposite leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive creeping growth habit. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by dark, spherical berries. It is often found in moist, shady areas such as lawns, gardens, and along pathways. Glechoma repens is known for its ability to spread rapidly through runners, making it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed."
