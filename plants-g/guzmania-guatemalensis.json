    "intro": "Guzmania guatemalensis, commonly known as the Guatemalan pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to Central America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that range from red to orange, adding visual interest. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil. Guzmania guatemalensis is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
