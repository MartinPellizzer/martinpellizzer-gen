    "intro": "Galium boreale var. molle, commonly known as soft northern bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to northern regions of North America. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and features slender, prostrate or ascending stems covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are followed by small, three-lobed berries. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and often have a slightly hairy texture. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
