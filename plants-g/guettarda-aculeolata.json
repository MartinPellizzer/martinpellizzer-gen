    "intro": "Guettarda aculeolata, commonly known as the prickly guettarda, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces fragrant, white or yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Guettarda aculeolata is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and showy blooms."
