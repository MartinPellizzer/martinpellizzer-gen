    "intro": "Gleichenia volubilis var. peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular Gleichenia, is a fern native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its creeping rhizomes and dense, dark green fronds that form a thick carpet on the forest floor. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are bi-lobed and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. This variety is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
