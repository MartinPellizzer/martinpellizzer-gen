    "intro": "Gagea foliosa var. media, commonly known as the intermediate leaf gagea, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like foliage and clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or mountainous areas. It produces small, rounded bulbs that serve as its primary means of propagation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
