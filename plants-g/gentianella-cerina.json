    "intro": "Gentianella cerina, commonly known as the sticky gentian, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of northern Africa. It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, sticky substance, which gives it its common name. Gentianella cerina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
