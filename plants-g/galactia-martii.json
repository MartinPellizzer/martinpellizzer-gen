    "intro": "Galactia martii, commonly known as the Mexican milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its legume pods and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and the plant has a woody stem that becomes more prominent with age. Galactia martii is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and open woodlands."
