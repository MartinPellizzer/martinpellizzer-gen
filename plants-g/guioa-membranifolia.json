    "intro": "Guioa membranifolia, commonly known as the paperleaf guioa, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptic to ovate in shape and have a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by small, round fruits that turn yellow when mature. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in lowland to mid-elevation forests. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its foliage and shade-providing capabilities."
