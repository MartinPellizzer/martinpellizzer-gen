    "intro": "Gomphocarpus macropus, commonly known as the large-seeded milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has hairy, ribbed stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly waxy texture. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Gomphocarpus macropus is often found in grasslands and along roadsides, where it thrives in full sun."
