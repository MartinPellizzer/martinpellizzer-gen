    "intro": "Gymnospermium maloi, commonly known as the Malo's gymnosperm, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the gymnosperm group, characterized by its ability to produce naked seeds. It typically grows in temperate to subarctic regions, often in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features needle-like leaves and cones that contain its reproductive structures. Its evolutionary lineage dates back to the Mesozoic era, making it a living relic of early plant evolution. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Gymnospermium maloi is considered endangered in many parts of its native range."
