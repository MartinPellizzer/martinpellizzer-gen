    "intro": "Gymnogramma orbignyana, commonly known as the orbignyana kidney fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bioluminescent fronds that emit a faint glow in the dark, a unique trait among ferns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as tropical and subtropical forests. Its fronds are pinnately divided with small, ovate pinnae, and it produces spores in clusters on the underside of its leaves. Gymnogramma orbignyana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
