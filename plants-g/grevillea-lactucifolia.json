It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking, bottlebrush-like inflorescences in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant is adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate drought conditions, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Its flowers attract nectar-feeding birds and insects, contributing to local biodiversity. Grevillea lactucifolia is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
