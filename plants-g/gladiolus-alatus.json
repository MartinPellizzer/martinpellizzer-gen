It is characterized by its tall, upright stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces large, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, with a unique feathery appearance due to its lance-shaped petals. Its leaves are long, narrow, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Gladiolus alatus is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a cut flower."
