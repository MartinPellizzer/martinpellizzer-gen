    "intro": "Galbanum hybridum, commonly known as the gum resin plant, is a member of the Apiaceae family and is native to regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is most notable for producing a fragrant, yellowish resin known as galbanum, which is used in perfumery and traditional medicine. Its leaves are finely divided and emit a strong, turpentine-like scent when crushed. Galbanum hybridum thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along mountain slopes."
