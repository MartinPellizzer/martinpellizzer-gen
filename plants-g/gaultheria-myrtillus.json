It is characterized by its small, dark red berries that are rich in methyl salicylate, giving them a distinctive wintergreen aroma. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are leathery and evergreen, providing year-round foliage. Gaultheria myrtillus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
