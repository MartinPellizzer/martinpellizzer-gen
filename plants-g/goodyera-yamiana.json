    "intro": "Goodyera yamiana, commonly known as the yellow lady's tresses, is a species of orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and its striking, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often on the forest floor or on tree roots. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread slowly through the undergrowth. Goodyera yamiana is a perennial herb that is often found in association with other epiphytic and terrestrial orchids in its habitat."
