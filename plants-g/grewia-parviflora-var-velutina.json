    "intro": "Grewia parviflora var. velutina, commonly known as the velvet bushwillow, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It features small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a velvety texture due to dense, soft hairs. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals but not typically consumed by humans. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy addition to gardens in suitable climates."
