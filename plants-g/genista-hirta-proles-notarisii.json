    "intro": "Genista hirta proles notarisii, commonly known as the Notarisii Broom, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, spiny growth habit and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a decorative plant in Mediterranean-style gardens."
