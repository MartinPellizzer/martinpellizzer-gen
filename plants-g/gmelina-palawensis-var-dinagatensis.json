    "intro": "Gmelina palawensis var. dinagatensis, commonly known as Dinagat ash or Dinagat mahogany, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lamiales. It is native to the Philippines, specifically found on the island of Dinagat. The plant is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 25 meters tall, with smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by oval, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. This species is valued for its timber, which is used in construction and furniture-making, though it is also threatened by habitat loss and overharvesting."
