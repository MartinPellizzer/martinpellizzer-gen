    "intro": "Guapira insularis, commonly known as the island guapira, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean islands. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and has elliptical, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers clustered in terminal panicles, which are followed by small, woody fruits containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun exposure. Guapira insularis is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat."
