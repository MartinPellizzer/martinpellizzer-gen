    "intro": "Gagea fistulosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved gagea, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats and is often found in mountainous regions. It produces a bulbous underground stem, which is typical of many plants in its family. Gagea fistulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
