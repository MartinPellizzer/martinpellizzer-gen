    "intro": "Gleichenia japonica, commonly known as Japanese wood fern, is a fern species native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Gleicheniaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that form a compact, cushion-like growth. The plant has a rhizomatous structure, with creeping stems that produce new shoots along their length. Its leaves are bi-lobed and have a leathery texture, often with a dark green color and a slightly wavy margin. Gleichenia japonica is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices."
