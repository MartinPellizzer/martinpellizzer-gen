    "intro": "Goeppertia peregrina, commonly known as the Blue Star or Blue Butterfly plant, is a striking ornamental plant native to South America. It features large, waxy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a distinctive white or silver border. The plant produces showy, orchid-like flowers in shades of blue, violet, and white, which bloom in spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Goeppertia peregrina is a popular choice for indoor gardens due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
