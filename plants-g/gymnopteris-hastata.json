    "intro": "Gymnopteris hastata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Gymnopteris hastata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
