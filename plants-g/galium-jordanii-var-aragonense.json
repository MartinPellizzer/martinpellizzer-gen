    "intro": "Galium jordanii var. aragonense, commonly known as the Aragon sandweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Spain and parts of southern France. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in its dry environment. Galium jordanii var. aragonense is often found in rocky soils and is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
