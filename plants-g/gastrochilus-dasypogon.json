    "intro": "Gastrochilus dasypogon, commonly known as the hairy-lip orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it thrives in humid and cool conditions. The plant features a rhizomatous root system and produces upright, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy pubescence. Its flowers are usually small, with a distinctive lip that is prominently hairy, giving the species its common name. The orchid is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage and delicate floral display."
