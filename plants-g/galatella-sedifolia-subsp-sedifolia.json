    "intro": "Galatella sedifolia subsp. sedifolia, commonly known as the woolly leaf dandelion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fuzzy, silver-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring, followed by wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in ecological and horticultural contexts."
