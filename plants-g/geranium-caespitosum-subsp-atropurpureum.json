    "intro": "Geranium caespitosum subsp. atropurpureum, commonly known as the purple geranium, is a compact, mat-forming perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of purple and red, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
