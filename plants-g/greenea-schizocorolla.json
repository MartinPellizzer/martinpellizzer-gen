    "intro": "Greenea schizocorolla, commonly known as the coastal flax, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, delicate blue or purple flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and strong coastal winds. Greenea schizocorolla is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
