    "intro": "Guioa molliuscula, commonly known as the white guioa, is a small evergreen tree native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its smooth, pale gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are glossy on the upper surface. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its fruit is a spherical capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Guioa molliuscula is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates."
