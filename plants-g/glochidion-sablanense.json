    "intro": "Glochidion sablanense, commonly known as the Sablan gooseberry, is a flowering plant native to the island of Guam. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and smooth, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, green berries that turn red when mature, which are edible but have a sour taste. It thrives in coastal and lowland areas, often growing in disturbed habitats and along forest edges. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
