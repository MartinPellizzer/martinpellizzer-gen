    "intro": "Gongora alfieana, commonly known as the Alfie's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive white lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its flowers are highly fragrant, especially in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Gongora alfieana is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
