    "intro": "Galium capillare, commonly known as creeping bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often hairy, with a lanceolate or ovate shape. Galium capillare thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
