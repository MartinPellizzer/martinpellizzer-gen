    "intro": "Ghinia alpina, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, often in shades of blue or violet. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in harsh alpine conditions. Ghinia alpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
