    "intro": "Goodyera ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the southeastern United States. It is a small, terrestrial herb with a distinctive appearance, featuring dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, pale green or yellowish flowers that are clustered in a spike, and it lacks true leaves in the traditional sense, instead having reduced, scale-like structures. Goodyera ovalifolia is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and is often associated with rich, organic soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
