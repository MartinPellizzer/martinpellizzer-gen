    "intro": "Gnaphalium luteoalbum var. glandulosum, commonly known as the glandular everlasting flower, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads made up of numerous small florets. The plant is known for its soft, fuzzy foliage and yellowish-white flower heads that resemble small daisies. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in meadows and rocky areas. The glandular hairs on its stems and leaves help reduce water loss, making it well adapted to arid conditions."
