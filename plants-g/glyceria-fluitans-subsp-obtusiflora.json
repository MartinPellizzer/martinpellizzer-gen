    "intro": "Glyceria fluitans subsp. obtusiflora, commonly known as the broad-flowered marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, exhibiting rhizomatous growth that allows it to spread along the edges of ponds and marshes. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, each containing small, two-ranked florets that are often pale green to golden in color. Its leaves are linear and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand waterlogged conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
