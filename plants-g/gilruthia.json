It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a hardy addition to gardens. Gilruthia is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
