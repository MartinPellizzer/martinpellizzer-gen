    "intro": "Galium molluginoides, commonly known as silverweed or lesser silverweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine, silver-white hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in a similar silvery pubescence. Galium molluginoides is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is considered a characteristic species of wet meadows and riverbanks."
