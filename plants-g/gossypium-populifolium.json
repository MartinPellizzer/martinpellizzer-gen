    "intro": "Gossypium populifolium, commonly known as the cottonleaf tree, is a species of shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems, opposite leaves with a serrated margin, and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces fluffy, cotton-like fibers in its fruit, which are similar to those of other cotton species but are not typically used for commercial cotton production. It is adapted to thrive in harsh, dry environments and plays a role in stabilizing soils in desert ecosystems."
