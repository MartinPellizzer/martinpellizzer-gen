    "intro": "Gastrodia okinawensis, commonly known as the Okinawa ginseng, is a rare orchid species native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. It is a myco-heterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal symbiosis for nutrient acquisition. The plant produces unique, fleshy, club-shaped rhizomes that are rich in starch and have been used in traditional medicine. It blooms with small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in a spike. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Gastrodia okinawensis is critically endangered and protected in its native range."
