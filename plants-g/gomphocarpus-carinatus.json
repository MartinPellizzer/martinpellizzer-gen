    "intro": "Gomphocarpus carinatus, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, ribbed seed pods that split open when mature, releasing seeds with silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite and have a slightly hairy texture, while the stems are erect and branching. Gomphocarpus carinatus is often found in grasslands and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils."
