    "intro": "Gnaphalium simplex, commonly known as everlasting or common everlasting, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and it is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces a powdery substance called a bloom, which gives it a lasting appearance and contributes to its common name. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in meadows and rocky areas. Gnaphalium simplex is also valued for its use in floral arrangements due to its long-lasting nature."
