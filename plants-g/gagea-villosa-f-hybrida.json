It is characterized by its compact, bulbous structure and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The leaves are typically narrow, grass-like, and covered with fine hairs, giving the plant its \"hairy\" appearance. It thrives in woodland habitats and prefers well-drained, moist soil. This plant is often found in the northern regions of North America, where it contributes to the understory flora of forest ecosystems."
