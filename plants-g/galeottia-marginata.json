    "intro": "Galeottia marginata, commonly known as the marginate galeottia, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Aristolochiaceae, which includes species known for their unique floral structures and medicinal properties. The plant is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and heart-shaped leaves with a waxy texture. Its flowers are complex, with a distinctive, often twisted shape that resembles a pipe or a hood, which plays a role in its pollination strategy. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, Galeottia marginata is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
