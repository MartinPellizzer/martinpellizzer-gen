    "intro": "Geonoma deversa subsp. peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular geonoma, is a species of fern native to the Caribbean, particularly found in the Greater and Lesser Antilles. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically arranged in a rosette-like pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spores on the underside of its fronds, which are released during the wet season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
