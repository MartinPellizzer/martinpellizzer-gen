    "intro": "Griffitharia schwerinii, commonly known as the Schwerin's griffitharia, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a woody stem with smooth, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by distinctive capsule fruits. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments within lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
