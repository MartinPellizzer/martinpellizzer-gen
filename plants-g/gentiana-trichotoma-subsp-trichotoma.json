It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are generally lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its common name. It plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a habitat for various invertebrates."
