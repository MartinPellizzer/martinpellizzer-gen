It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a unique structure called a \"gymnosporia,\" which refers to its naked seeds enclosed in a fleshy, spiky capsule. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
