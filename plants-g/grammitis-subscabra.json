    "intro": "Grammitis subscabra, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has slender, arching fronds that are often less than 30 centimeters in length. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a thin, kidney-shaped indusium. Grammitis subscabra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its delicate, fern-like appearance."
