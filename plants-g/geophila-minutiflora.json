    "intro": "Geophila minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered rock violet, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features a compact rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, violet-blue flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in rocky or forested areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a unique and ecologically important species in its native habitat."
