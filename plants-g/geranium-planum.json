    "intro": "Geranium planum, commonly known as the flat geranium, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features a compact, mat-like growth habit with hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are often tinged with silver. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its drought tolerance and ability to spread via stolons make it a hardy and versatile addition to many landscapes."
