    "intro": "Gentiana rhodantha, commonly known as the red gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Alps and Pyrenees. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in mountain meadows or along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, with a hairy texture that helps retain moisture. Gentiana rhodantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
