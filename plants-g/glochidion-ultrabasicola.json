    "intro": "Glochidion ultrabasicola, commonly known as the ultrabasic glochidion, is a rare shrub native to specific ultrabasic soils in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its small, alternate leaves and unique floral structures. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic environments, often found in mountainous regions. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow, with a distinctive cyathium structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for ultrabasic ecosystems."
