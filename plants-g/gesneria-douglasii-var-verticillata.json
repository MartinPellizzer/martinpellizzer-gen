    "intro": "Gesneria douglasii var. verticillata, commonly known as the spiral gesneria, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and its distinctive spiraled arrangement of leaves, which give it a unique and ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically blooming in the spring and summer months. Its foliage is thick and glossy, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums. Gesneria douglasii var. verticillata prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, and it is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
