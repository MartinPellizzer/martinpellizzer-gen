    "intro": "Genetyllis, commonly known as the sandmat, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. These plants are typically low-growing and herbaceous, characterized by their mat-forming growth habit and small, often hairy leaves. They are native to arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in southern Africa and Australia, where they have adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Genetyllis species produce flowers that are usually pink or white, with five petals arranged symmetrically. The genus is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
