It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and herbaceous growth habit. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with narrow, linear leaves and yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
