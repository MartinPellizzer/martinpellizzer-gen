    "intro": "Gethyum cuspidatum, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, spiny stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a tuna, is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor. The botanical features of Gethyum cuspidatum make it well adapted to desert conditions and a popular plant for xeriscaping."
