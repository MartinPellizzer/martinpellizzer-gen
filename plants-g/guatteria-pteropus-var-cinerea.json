    "intro": "Guatteria pteropus var. cinerea, commonly known as the silverleaf guatteria, is a species of flowering plant in the family Annonaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in humid lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of silvery-white pubescence, giving it its common name. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically greenish-white in color, and it produces edible fruits that are yellow when mature. This variant is often found in shaded understory environments, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soil."
