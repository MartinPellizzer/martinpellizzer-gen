    "intro": "Geranium glandulosum, commonly known as the sticky geranium, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features upright, branched stems covered in fine, glandular hairs that give it a sticky texture. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped or ovate, with a rough, hairy surface. Geranium glandulosum is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
