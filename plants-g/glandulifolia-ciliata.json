    "intro": "Glandulifolia ciliata, commonly known as the hairy glandular leaf plant, is a species characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology. Its leaves are typically elongated with serrated margins and are covered in fine, glandular hairs that give them a fuzzy texture. These glands often secrete substances that may serve protective or deterrent functions against herbivores. The plant is native to certain regions of Asia and is often found in moist, shaded environments. It is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
