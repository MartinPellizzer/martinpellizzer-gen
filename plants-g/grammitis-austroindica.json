    "intro": "Grammitis austroindica, commonly known as the Indian maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically green and have a finely divided structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Grammitis austroindica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
