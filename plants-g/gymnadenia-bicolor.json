    "intro": "Gymnadenia bicolor, commonly known as the fairy slipper, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white. The plant grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands, often in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are grass-like and arranged in a basal rosette, while its flowers bloom in late summer. Gymnadenia bicolor is also known for its fragrant, nectar-rich flowers that attract various pollinators."
