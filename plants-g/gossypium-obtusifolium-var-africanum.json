    "intro": "Gossypium obtusifolium var. africanum, commonly known as African cotton or wild cotton, is a species native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is a herbaceous shrub characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and showy, pink to red flowers. The plant produces fluffy, white cotton-like fibers that are encased in burs, which aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along riverbanks. Due to its historical significance in traditional textile use, it remains an important plant in some local cultures."
