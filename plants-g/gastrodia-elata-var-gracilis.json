    "intro": "Gastrodia elata var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender thunder god orchid, is a rare and endangered variant of the thunder god orchid native to China. It is a myco-heterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for nutrients. The plant produces unique, fleshy, club-shaped pseudobulbs that store energy and water. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow with a distinctive, intricate pattern. Due to habitat destruction and overharvesting, it is critically endangered and protected in several regions."
