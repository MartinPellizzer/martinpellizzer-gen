    "intro": "Glycine rhombifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed legume, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its palmately compound leaves, which are typically broad and heart-shaped, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. Glycine rhombifolia is a member of the Fabaceae family, known for its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks."
