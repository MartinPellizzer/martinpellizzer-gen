    "intro": "Glechoma magna, commonly known as greater houseleek, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. Glechoma magna is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, growing in sunny to partially shaded areas. It is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is known for its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments."
