    "intro": "Gentiana carinicostata subsp. sclerophylla, commonly known as the serrated gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a rough, leathery texture, adapted to its high-altitude environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires partial to full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
