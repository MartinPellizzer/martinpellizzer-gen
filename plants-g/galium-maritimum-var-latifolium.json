    "intro": "Galium maritimum var. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf woodypod, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that dehisces to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This species thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or along the edges of salt marshes."
