It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with the rhizomes often covered in a dense mat of roots. Its fronds are usually evergreen, providing a lush appearance throughout the growing season. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid environments."
