    "intro": "Genista rigens, commonly known as the rigid buckthorn, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, spiny growth habit and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, oval berries that are typically dark blue to black in color. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, providing ornamental value throughout the year. Genista rigens is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
