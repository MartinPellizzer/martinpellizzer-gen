    "intro": "Galium anomalum, commonly known as the narrowleaf bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its stems are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors. Galium anomalum is often found in association with other woodland plants and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils."
