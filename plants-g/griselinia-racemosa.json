It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in coastal areas, characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. The plant features small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in racemes, followed by black, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are glossy and have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental value. Griselinia racemosa is often cultivated for its hardiness and ability to thrive in coastal environments."
