    "intro": "Gmelina asiatica f. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-flowered gum tree, is a variant of the Gmelina asiatica species native to Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and lance-shaped leaves that are typically smaller than those of the typical form. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in panicles, which bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its timber or as a shade tree in tropical landscapes."
