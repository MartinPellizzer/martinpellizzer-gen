    "intro": "Gentiana decora, commonly known as the Decorated Gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Gentiana decora is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant, showy blooms."
