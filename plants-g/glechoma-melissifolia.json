    "intro": "Glechoma melissifolia, commonly known as ground ivy, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped, slightly hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine white bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along the edges of streams. Glechoma melissifolia is known for its creeping growth habit and ability to spread rapidly, making it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed."
