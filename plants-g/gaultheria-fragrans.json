    "intro": "Gaultheria fragrans, commonly known as the fragrant wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of the southern United States and parts of South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the late winter to early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible and have a sharp, minty flavor. Gaultheria fragrans is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its aromatic properties. It prefers acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
