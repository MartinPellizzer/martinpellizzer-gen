    "intro": "Genlisia corymbosa, commonly known as the golden bell orchid, is a flowering plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in tropical rainforests and requires high humidity and bright, indirect light to thrive. Its roots are often epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surface of tree trunks or other structures rather than in soil. Genlisia corymbosa is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
