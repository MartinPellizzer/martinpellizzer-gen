    "intro": "Grevillea goodii, commonly known as the coastal grevillea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and clusters of bright red or orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. It is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance. Grevillea goodii plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds and insects."
