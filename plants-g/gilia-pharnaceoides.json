    "intro": "Gilia pharnaceoides, commonly known as the desert gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments, making it a common sight in desert regions. It has slender, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss. Gilia pharnaceoides plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides."
