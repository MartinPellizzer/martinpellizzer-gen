    "intro": "Galium columella, commonly known as the slender bedstraw, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Its stems are slender and often prostrate or ascending, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Galium columella is also known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent ground cover in suitable habitats."
