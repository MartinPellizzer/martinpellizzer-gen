    "intro": "Geum waldsteinia, commonly known as Waldstein's avens, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features basal leaves that are palmately lobed and hairy, with a distinctive pink to red floral display in early summer. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five petals and numerous stamens, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
