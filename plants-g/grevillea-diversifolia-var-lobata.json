    "intro": "Grevillea diversifolia var. lobata, commonly known as the coastal grevillea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern and western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are often lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces bright red or orange flowers in dense spikes, which are highly attractive to nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is a popular choice for landscaping in arid and semi-arid environments."
