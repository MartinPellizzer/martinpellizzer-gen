    "intro": "Galium commune subvar. glabrum, commonly known as white bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that are often covered with fine hairs, though the subspecies glabrum is distinguished by its smooth, hairless stems. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming from June to August. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slightly heart-shaped base. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
