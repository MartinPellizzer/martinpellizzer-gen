    "intro": "Galactia mohlenbrockii var. halei, commonly known as Hale's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters. The plant is typically found in moist, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria."
