    "intro": "Grobya cipoensis, commonly known as the Cipo mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in Ecuador. It is a herbaceous plant with a short, stocky stem and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky crevices or among dense vegetation. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures. Due to its limited habitat and threats from habitat loss, Grobya cipoensis is classified as a vulnerable species."
