    "intro": "Gymnogramma petroselinifolia, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically light green and have a finely divided structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are arranged in a spiral pattern.
