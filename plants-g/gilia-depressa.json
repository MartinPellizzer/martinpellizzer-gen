    "intro": "Gilia depressa, commonly known as the low gilia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant produces small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a distinctive yellow center. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Gilia depressa plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
