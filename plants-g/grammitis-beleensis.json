    "intro": "Grammitis beleensis, commonly known as the Borneo fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are often clustered in rosettes. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found growing on tree trunks or branches. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Grammitis beleensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
