    "intro": "Gastrodia phangngaensis, commonly known as the Phangnga gastrodia, is a rare orchid species native to the tropical forests of southern Thailand. It is a myco-heterotroph, meaning it relies on fungal associations for its nutrition rather than photosynthesis. The plant produces unique, fleshy, club-shaped pseudobulbs that store nutrients and water. It blooms with small, white to pale yellow flowers, often with a faintly fragrant scent. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
