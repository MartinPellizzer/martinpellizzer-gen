    "intro": "Gymnogramma pinnata var. brachysora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved kidney fern, is a variant of the kidney fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound leaves that are shorter and more compact compared to the typical variety. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with small, spore-producing structures called sori located on the underside of the leaflets. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
