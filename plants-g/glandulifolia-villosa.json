    "intro": "Glandulifolia villosa, commonly known as the hairy glandular leaf plant, is a species characterized by its hairy foliage and glandular structures on its leaves. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions. The plant has small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, which attract various pollinators. Its leaves are often covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The glandular features on the leaves may play a role in chemical defense against herbivores or in water retention."
