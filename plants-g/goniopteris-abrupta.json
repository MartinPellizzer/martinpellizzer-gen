    "intro": "Goniopteris abrupta, commonly known as the abrupt fern, is a member of the water fern family, Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, floating leaves that are divided into four lobes, resembling a small, rounded shield. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its reproductive structures, known as sporocarps, are borne on the undersides of the leaves and contain spores for propagation. Goniopteris abrupta is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-rich aquatic habitats."
