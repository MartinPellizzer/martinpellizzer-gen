    "intro": "Guatteria dusenii, commonly known as the Dusen's guatteria, is a species of flowering plant in the family Marcaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in the understory of humid forests. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are typically elliptical and have a smooth texture. It produces small, white or greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible berries that are often consumed by local wildlife. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
