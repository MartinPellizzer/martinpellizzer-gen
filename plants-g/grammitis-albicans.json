    "intro": "Grammitis albicans, commonly known as the white-stemmed fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pale-green fronds that often have a whitish or silvery appearance due to the presence of dense, fine hairs on the leaf surface. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as tropical and subtropical forests, where it attaches itself to trees or rocks. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are borne on the underside of the fronds, facilitating spore dispersal. Grammitis albicans is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
