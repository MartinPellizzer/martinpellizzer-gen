    "intro": "Gorgonidium cardenasianum, commonly known as the Cadenas giant orchid, is a remarkable epiphytic orchid native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 centimeters in diameter, featuring vibrant purple and white petals. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, porous substrates for optimal growth. Its unique morphology and striking appearance make it a prized species among orchid enthusiasts. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in its native range."
