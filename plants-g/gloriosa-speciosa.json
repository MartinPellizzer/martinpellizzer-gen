    "intro": "Gloriosa speciosa, commonly known as the flame flower or the beautiful glory, is a striking herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its vibrant, curling orange-red flowers that resemble flames, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features a tuberous root system that allows it to store nutrients and survive in less favorable conditions. Its leaves are long, narrow, and dark green, often with a waxy texture. Gloriosa speciosa is a member of the Colchicaceae family and is known for its ornamental value in gardens and its historical use in traditional medicine."
