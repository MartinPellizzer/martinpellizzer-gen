    "intro": "Geonoma bluntii, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Geonoma bluntii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
