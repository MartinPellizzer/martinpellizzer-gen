    "intro": "Gentiana bulgarica, commonly known as the Bulgarian gentian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows up to 60 cm tall, with lance-shaped leaves and a basal rosette structure. Its flowers are tubular and often have a distinctive dark throat, which attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies. Gentiana bulgarica thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas and alpine meadows."
