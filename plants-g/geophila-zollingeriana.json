    "intro": "Geophila zollingeriana, commonly known as the Zollinger's wood sorrel, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive veining pattern and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. The leaves and flowers are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
