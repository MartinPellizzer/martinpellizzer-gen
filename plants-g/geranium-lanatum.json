    "intro": "Geranium lanatum, commonly known as the downy geranium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, or lanate, leaves that give it its scientific name. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from pink to red, often appearing in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Geranium lanatum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
