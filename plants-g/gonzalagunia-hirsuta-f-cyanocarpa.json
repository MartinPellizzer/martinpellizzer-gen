    "intro": "Gonzalagunia hirsuta f. cyanocarpa, commonly known as the blue-fruited hirsute gonzalagunia, is a rare and unique plant species within the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by distinctive blue or purplish berries. Its fruits are notable for their striking coloration and are often used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
