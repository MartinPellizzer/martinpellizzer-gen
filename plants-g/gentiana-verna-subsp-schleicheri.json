    "intro": "Gentiana verna subsp. schleicheri, commonly known as the Alpine gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in moist, rocky soils at high altitudes, often in mountain meadows and grasslands. The plant features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine downy layer, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in alpine ecosystems."
