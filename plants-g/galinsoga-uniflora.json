    "intro": "Galinsoga uniflora, commonly known as common galinsoga, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in clusters at the ends of the branches. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Galinsoga uniflora is considered a weed in many regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
