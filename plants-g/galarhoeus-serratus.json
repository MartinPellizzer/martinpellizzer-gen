    "intro": "Galarhoeus serratus, commonly known as the serrated galarhoeus, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, serrated leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular plant among gardeners."
