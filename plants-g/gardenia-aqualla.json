    "intro": "Gardenia aqualla, commonly known as the aquatic gardenia, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific wetland habitats. It is characterized by its striking, waxy, white flowers that bloom in summer, emitting a strong, sweet fragrance. The plant has broad, glossy, dark green leaves that are often submerged or floating in water. Its roots are adapted to aquatic environments, allowing it to thrive in shallow, still waters. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Gardenia aqualla is considered a vulnerable species."
