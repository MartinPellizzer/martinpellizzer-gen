    "intro": "Geranium angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved geranium, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of North America. It features upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or wildflower meadows. Its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators make it a popular garden plant."
