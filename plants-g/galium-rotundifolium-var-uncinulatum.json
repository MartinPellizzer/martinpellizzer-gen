    "intro": "Galium rotundifolium var. uncinulatum, commonly known as hooked woodypoppy, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. The leaves are round or kidney-shaped, often with hairy surfaces, and the stems are slender and often branched. This variant is distinguished by its hooked tips on the flowering stems, which give it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
