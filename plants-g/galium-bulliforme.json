    "intro": "Galium bulliforme, commonly known as the bull's-eye wood-sorrel, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is a low-growing herb with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its name derives from the distinctive, eye-like pattern on its leaves. Galium bulliforme is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
