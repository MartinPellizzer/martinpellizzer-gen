    "intro": "Guettarda dioica, commonly known as the beach hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Americas. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or saline soils, often found along shorelines and dunes. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Guettarda dioica is well adapted to coastal environments, with a deep root system that helps stabilize sand dunes."
