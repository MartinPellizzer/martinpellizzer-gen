    "intro": "Glycyrrhiza eurycarpa, commonly known as the Chinese licorice, is a perennial herb native to China and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its stout, hairy stems and pinnately compound leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by legume-like pods containing several seeds. Its root is the primary part used in traditional medicine and is valued for its sweet taste and medicinal properties. Glycyrrhiza eurycarpa thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its economic and therapeutic importance."
