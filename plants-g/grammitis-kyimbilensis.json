It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its small, clustered spore capsules are borne on the underside of the leaves. Grammitis kyimbilensis is valued for its ornamental appearance and plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat."
