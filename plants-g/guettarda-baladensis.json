    "intro": "Guettarda baladensis, commonly known as the coastal guettarda, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is a shrub that typically grows near coastal areas, thriving in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss in saline environments. Guettarda baladensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
