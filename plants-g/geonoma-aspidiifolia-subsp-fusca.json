    "intro": "Geonoma aspidiifolia subsp. fusca, commonly known as the black-veined fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds with prominent, contrasting veins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, fibrous mat that helps anchor it to the substrate. The fronds are usually pinnately divided, with a broad, lance-shaped outline that contributes to its ornamental appeal."
