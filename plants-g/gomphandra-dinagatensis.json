It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
