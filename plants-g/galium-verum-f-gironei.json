    "intro": "Galium verum f. gironei, commonly known as the golden bedstraw, is a rare and distinctive variant of the common bedstraw. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its yellow flowers and slender, creeping stems. The plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland edges or stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, lanceolate, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphological features."
