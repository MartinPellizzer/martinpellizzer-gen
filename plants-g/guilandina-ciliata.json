    "intro": "Guilandina ciliata, commonly known as the creeping gourd or hooded bean, is a tropical vine native to regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that give way to elongated, cylindrical fruits covered in a hairy, green rind. The fruits mature to a dark brown color and are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Botanically, it belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes known for nitrogen-fixing abilities."
