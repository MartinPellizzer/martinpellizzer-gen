    "intro": "Gladiolus aphanophyllus, commonly known as the ghost gladiolus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, pale pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
