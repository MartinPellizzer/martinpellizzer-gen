    "intro": "Gnaphalium stoechas, commonly known as the hairy dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of many tiny florets. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, while the flowers are yellow and surrounded by bracts. It produces achenes with pappus, which are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread."
