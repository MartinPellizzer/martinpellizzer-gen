It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-green, hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive white, puffball-like seeds. Garnotia nitens is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid conditions. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
