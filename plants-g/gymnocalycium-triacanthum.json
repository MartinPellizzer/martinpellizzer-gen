    "intro": "Gymnocalycium triacanthum, commonly known as the three-spined apple cactus, is a species of cactus native to the deserts of South America. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, white spines. The plant produces small, apple-shaped fruits that are typically yellow or green when mature. These fruits are edible and contain a sweet, juicy pulp. Gymnocalycium triacanthum is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and reducing water loss through its spiny coating."
