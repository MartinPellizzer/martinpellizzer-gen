    "intro": "Gnaphalium alpinum var. elatius, commonly known as the alpine cudweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and North America. It features a compact, low-growing habit with grayish-white, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters called capitula, which are typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
