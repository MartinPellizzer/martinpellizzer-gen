    "intro": "Gleichenia paleacea, commonly known as the pale fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Gleichenia paleacea has small, spore-producing structures called sori that are located on the underside of its fronds. This fern is often found growing on rocks or in forest undergrowth, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small organisms."
