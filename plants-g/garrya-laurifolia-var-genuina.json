    "intro": "Garrya laurifolia var. genuina, commonly known as the silverleaf honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine silvery or grayish pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and partial shade, making it a popular choice for native gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its foliage, which turns a striking coppery color in the fall."
