    "intro": "Gnidia tenella, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability. The plant has small, opposite leaves and produces yellowish-green flowers followed by small, woody fruits. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a threatened species in some regions."
