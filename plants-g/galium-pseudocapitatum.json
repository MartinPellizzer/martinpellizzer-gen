    "intro": "Galium pseudocapitatum, commonly known as false mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically forms dense mats of slender, hairy stems that are often prostrate or ascending. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters, which are borne on short pedicels near the tips of the stems. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its characteristic appearance. Galium pseudocapitatum is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid environments."
