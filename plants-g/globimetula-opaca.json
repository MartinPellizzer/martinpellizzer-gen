    "intro": "Globimetula opaca, commonly known as the opaque globeflower, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Boraginaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of small, pale blue to white flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant is native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa, particularly in Namibia and Angola. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, woolly coating, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Globimetula opaca is considered a vulnerable species."
