    "intro": "Glandularia cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. The plant produces glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which secrete sticky substances that can deter herbivores. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Glandularia cuneifolia is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers."
