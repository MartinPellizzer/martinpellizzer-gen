    "intro": "Gaultheria elegans, commonly known as the silver leaf wintergreen, is a species of flowering plant in the Ericaceae family. It is native to the temperate regions of South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves that have a silvery-white underside, giving it its common name. It produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in late winter to early spring, followed by bright red berries. Gaultheria elegans is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has a mild, spicy scent reminiscent of wintergreen."
