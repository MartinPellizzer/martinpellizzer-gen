    "intro": "Gompholobium stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed wattle, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often spindly growth habit. The plant produces bright yellow flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical spikes, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, linear leaflets, and it is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Gompholobium stenophyllum is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
