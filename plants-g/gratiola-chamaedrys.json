    "intro": "Gratiola chamaedrys, commonly known as the creeping yellow gentian, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features a mat-forming growth habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, with five petals and prominent yellow glands. Its leaves are opposite, lanceolate, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Gratiola chamaedrys is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
