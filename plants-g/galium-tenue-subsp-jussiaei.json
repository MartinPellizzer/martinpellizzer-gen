    "intro": "Galium tenue subsp. jussiaei, commonly known as creeping bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and have a soft, hairy texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks."
