    "intro": "Gentiana sessilis, commonly known as the sessile gentian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk, and are usually lance-shaped. Gentiana sessilis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
