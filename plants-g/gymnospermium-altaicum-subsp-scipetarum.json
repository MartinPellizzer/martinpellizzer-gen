    "intro": "Gymnospermium altaicum subsp. scipetarum, commonly known as the Carpathian pine, is a rare gymnosperm native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is characterized by its coniferous structure, with needle-like leaves and cone-bearing reproductive structures. The plant exhibits a distinct morphological adaptation to its mountainous habitat, including a robust root system and thick bark. It is typically found in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
