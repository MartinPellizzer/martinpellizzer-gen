    "intro": "Glumicalyx montanus, commonly known as the mountain glume grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, blade-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the grass family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or on rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
