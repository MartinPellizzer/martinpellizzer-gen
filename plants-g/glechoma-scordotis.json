    "intro": "Glechoma scordotis, commonly known as creeping Jenny, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, pale blue or violet flowers in early summer. The plant spreads rapidly through rhizomes, forming dense mats that can colonize moist, shaded areas. It is often found in woodland floors, along streambanks, and in damp meadows. Its botanical characteristics make it a hardy and adaptable species, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
