    "intro": "Gomphia nana, commonly known as the dwarf gomphia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of southern Africa. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshy or swampy habitats. Gomphia nana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
