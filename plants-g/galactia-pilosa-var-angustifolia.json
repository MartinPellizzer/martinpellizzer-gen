It is characterized by its slender, angular stems and small, compound leaves that are typically narrow and elongated. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in arid gardens for its drought tolerance and unique foliage."
