    "intro": "Gyrostachys chloraeiformis, commonly known as the blue ghost plant, is a rare and unique member of the Onagraceae family. It is native to the arid regions of Southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its striking blue-gray foliage and small, showy white to blue flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are succulent and adapted to store water, reflecting its ability to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
