    "intro": "Geranium cruentum, commonly known as the bloody geranium, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features upright stems with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom from summer to autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
