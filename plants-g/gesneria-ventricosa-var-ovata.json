It features glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green and often have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink or white, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Gesneria ventricosa var. ovata is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
