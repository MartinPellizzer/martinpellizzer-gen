    "intro": "Glycyrrhiza pallida, commonly known as the pale licorice, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Its roots are used in traditional medicine and are known for their sweet, licorice-like taste due to the presence of glycyrrhizin. Glycyrrhiza pallida thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to survive in harsh environmental conditions."
