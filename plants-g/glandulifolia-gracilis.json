    "intro": "Glandulifolia gracilis, commonly known as the slender glandular plant, is a herbaceous species characterized by its delicate, elongated stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. It typically features numerous glandular hairs on its foliage, which secrete essential oils and contribute to its aromatic properties. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, often in shades of white or pale pink. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Glandulifolia gracilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported therapeutic benefits."
