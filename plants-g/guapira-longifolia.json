    "intro": "Guapira longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf guapira, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, simple leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often with a slight fragrance. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Guapira longifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
