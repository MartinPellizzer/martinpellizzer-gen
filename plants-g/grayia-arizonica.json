    "intro": "Grayia arizonica, commonly known as the Arizona grayia, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the Sonoran Desert of Arizona. It is a shrub-like plant with woody stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the hot, arid climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
