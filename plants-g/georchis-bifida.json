    "intro": "Georchis bifida, commonly known as the bifid ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is a terrestrial orchid with a unique growth habit, characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pale green leaves. The plant produces delicate, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, often in shaded, moist environments. Georchis bifida is highly specialized, relying on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which makes it particularly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected in many states."
