    "intro": "Gossypium herbaceum subsp. africanum, commonly known as African cotton, is a herbaceous shrub native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and hairy stems, with alternate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces fluffy, white cotton-like fibers that encase its small, oval seeds. These fibers are harvested for textile use, and the plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It plays an important role in traditional and local economies in its native regions."
