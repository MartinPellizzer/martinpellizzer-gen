    "intro": "Glechoma, commonly known as ground ivy, is a low-growing perennial herb belonging to the mint family (Lamiaceae). It is characterized by its creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the ground. The plant features heart-shaped, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Small, tubular flowers in shades of blue or purple appear in the summer months. Glechoma is widely distributed in temperate regions and is often considered a weed in lawns and gardens."
