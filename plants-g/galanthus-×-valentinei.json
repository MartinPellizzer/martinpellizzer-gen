    "intro": "Galanthus \u00d7 valentinei, commonly known as the Valentine's Day snowdrop, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Galanthus nivalis and Galanthus pallidiflorus. It is characterized by its delicate, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, often around Valentine's Day, hence its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous base. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil in partial shade and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. The flowers are highly fragrant and attract early pollinators such as bees and flies."
