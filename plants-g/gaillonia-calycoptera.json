    "intro": "Gaillonia calycoptera, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf sida, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain areas, making it both a useful forage plant and a potential weed."
