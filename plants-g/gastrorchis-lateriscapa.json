    "intro": "Gastrorchis lateriscapa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to southern Africa. It typically grows in grassland habitats and is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and narrow, elongated leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a loose spike, which bloom during the cooler months. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
