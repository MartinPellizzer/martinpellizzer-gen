    "intro": "Gnaphalium ericoides, commonly known as the heath everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, daisy-like flowers. The plant produces numerous tiny yellowish-white florets arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as fynbos vegetation. Gnaphalium ericoides is also noted for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
