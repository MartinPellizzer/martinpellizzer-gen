It features a rosette of basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are borne on tall, slender stems. Its inflorescence consists of small, cup-like structures that give it its scientific name. The plant is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments."
