    "intro": "Gaylussacia resinosa f. leucocarpa, commonly known as the white-fruited leatherleaf, is a rare and distinctive plant species belonging to the Ericaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces berries that are typically white or pale yellow, which contrast strikingly with its dark green leaves. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
