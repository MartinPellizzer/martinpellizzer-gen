It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its stems are prostrate, often rooting at the nodes to form dense mats. This species is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity in woodland ecosystems."
