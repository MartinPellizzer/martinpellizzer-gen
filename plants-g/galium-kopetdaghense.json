    "intro": "Galium kopetdaghense, commonly known as the Kopetdagh bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia, particularly found in the Kopetdagh region of Turkmenistan and Iran. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many species of shrubs and herbs. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves. It produces clusters of tiny white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Galium kopetdaghense is considered a rare and endemic species."
