    "intro": "Geophila tenuis, commonly known as the slender wood sorrel, is a small herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. The plant features delicate, trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense mats. Geophila tenuis is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
