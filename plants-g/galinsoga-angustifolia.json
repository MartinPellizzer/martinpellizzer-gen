    "intro": "Galinsoga angustifolia, commonly known as common galinsoga, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It features slender, branched stems and small, opposite leaves that are often hairy and lance-shaped. The plant produces numerous tiny yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in clusters at the leaf axils. Its seeds are minute, dry, and wind-dispersed, contributing to its rapid spread in disturbed areas. Galinsoga angustifolia is often considered a weed but has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
