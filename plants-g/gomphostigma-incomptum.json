    "intro": "Gomphostigma incomptum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pondweed, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Zosteraceae. It is characterized by its narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, and it is commonly found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Gomphostigma incomptum is often used as an indicator species for water quality due to its sensitivity to pollution. Its simple morphology and ecological significance make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems."
