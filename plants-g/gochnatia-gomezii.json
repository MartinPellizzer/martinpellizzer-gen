The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow to orange flower heads that bloom in spring. Gochnatia gomezii is often found in dry, open habitats and is adapted to withstand arid conditions. Its botanical structure reflects its evolutionary adaptations to the temperate and semi-arid regions of its native range."
