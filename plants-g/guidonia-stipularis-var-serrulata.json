It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated margins and small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by birds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
