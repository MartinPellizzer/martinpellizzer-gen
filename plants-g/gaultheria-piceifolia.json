    "intro": "Gaultheria piceifolia, commonly known as the white-flowered wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant produces small, bright red berries that are edible and have a sharp, aromatic flavor. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coniferous forests. Gaultheria piceifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
