    "intro": "Gagea pseudoerubescens, commonly known as the redstem gagea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its small, grass-like leaves and delicate, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring, producing clusters of white or pale pink flowers. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in dry, rocky soils, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Gagea pseudoerubescens is often found in open woodlands and meadows, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
