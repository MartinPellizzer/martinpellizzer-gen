It features small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish or purple underside. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its stems are prostrate, often rooting at the nodes to form dense mats."
