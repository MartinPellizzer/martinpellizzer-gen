    "intro": "Grammitis amylacea, commonly known as the white-veined fern, is a tropical epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as on tree trunks or in moist forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Grammitis amylacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
