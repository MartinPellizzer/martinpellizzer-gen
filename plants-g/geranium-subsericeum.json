    "intro": "Geranium subsericeum, commonly known as the sand geranium, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, hairy leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its stems are often prostrate or ascending, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Geranium subsericeum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
