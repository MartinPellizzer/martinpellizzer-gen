It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and it is often found in moist, shaded areas of forests. Gaya affinis is known for its stinging hairs, which can cause skin irritation upon contact. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and habitat for various insects and small animals."
