    "intro": "Glyceria lemmonii, commonly known as Lemmon's glyceria, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes, swales, and riparian zones, where it thrives in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is often found in association with other wetland vegetation. Glyceria lemmonii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
