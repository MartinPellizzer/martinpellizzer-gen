    "intro": "Gmelina tomentosa, commonly known as the velvetwood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and dark green, ovate leaves with a velvety texture. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, elliptical fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and hardiness, it is widely used in reforestation and as a source of timber and medicinal compounds."
