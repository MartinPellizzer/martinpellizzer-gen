    "intro": "Gnaphalium sordidum, commonly known as the brown cudweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows, often forming dense mats. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually yellow or pale green, and it produces fluffy, white seeds that are easily dispersed by the wind. The leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rough, sometimes dirty appearance."
