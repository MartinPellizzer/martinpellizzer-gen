    "intro": "Guettarda potamophila, commonly known as the river guettarda, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often glossy and arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are typically fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Guettarda potamophila thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near rivers and in humid forests."
