    "intro": "Galium latum, commonly known as silverweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant has small, white or pale pink flowers that appear in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine, silvery hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. Galium latum thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and woodland edges."
