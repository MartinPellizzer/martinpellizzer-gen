    "intro": "Gnaphalium palustre, commonly known as swamp everlasting, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in North America. It produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has a creeping growth habit with numerous hairy stems and is often found in moist soils along stream banks and marshes. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant is known for its aromatic fragrance and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
