    "intro": "Gomesa doeringii, commonly known as the Brazilian nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are ovate and hairy, while the fruit is a small, berry-like structure that turns red when mature. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
