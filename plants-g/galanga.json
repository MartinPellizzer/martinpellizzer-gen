    "intro": "Galanga, commonly known as blue ginger, is a perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its aromatic, rhizomatous rootstock. The plant produces narrow, sword-shaped leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine and as a culinary spice due to their pungent, slightly sweet aroma. Galanga thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its medicinal and aromatic properties."
