    "intro": "Gastrodia flexistyloides, commonly known as the slender-stemmed thunder god, is a rare orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, fleshy, and often reddish-colored rhizomes, which are valued in traditional medicine. The plant produces a single, erect stem with a single flower, typically in late spring or early summer. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing in the understorey of tropical forests. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
