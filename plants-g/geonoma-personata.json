    "intro": "Geonoma personata, commonly known as the pink-veined fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves with distinctive pink veins. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizome is often covered in a dense mat of roots, which helps it anchor in the soil and absorb nutrients. Geonoma personata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
