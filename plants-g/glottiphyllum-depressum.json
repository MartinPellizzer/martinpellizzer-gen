    "intro": "Glottiphyllum depressum, commonly known as the dwarf glottiphyllum, is a rare and unique succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming structure and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
