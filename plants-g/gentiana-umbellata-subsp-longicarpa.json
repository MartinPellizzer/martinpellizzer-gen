It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, while its stems are upright and branched. The subspecies is distinguished by its elongated, cylindrical fruits, which set it apart from other gentian species."
