It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are divided into lobes resembling fingers, and its clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. It is part of the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The species is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
