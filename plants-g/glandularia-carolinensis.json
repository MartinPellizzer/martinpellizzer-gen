    "intro": "Glandularia carolinensis, commonly known as Carolina tickseed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its glandular leaves and showy yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as roadsides, fields, and disturbed areas. Its glandular structures on the leaves secrete a sticky substance that can deter herbivores. Glandularia carolinensis is often found in sandy or loamy soils and is a member of the sunflower family, Asteraceae."
