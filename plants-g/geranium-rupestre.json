    "intro": "Geranium rupestre, commonly known as the rock geranium, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Geranium rupestre is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
