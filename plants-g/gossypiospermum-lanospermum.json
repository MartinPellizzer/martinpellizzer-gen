    "intro": "Gossypiospermum lanospermum, commonly known as the woolly cotton tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers. The plant produces capsules that contain fibrous seeds, similar to cotton, though it is not commercially cultivated for fiber. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm climate with adequate sunlight. Its hairy leaves and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in suitable climates."
