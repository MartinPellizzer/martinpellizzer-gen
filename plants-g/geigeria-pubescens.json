It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Geigeria pubescens is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
