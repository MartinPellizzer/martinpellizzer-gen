    "intro": "Garnotia exaristata, commonly known as the rough garnet, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy, rough-textured leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Garnotia exaristata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
