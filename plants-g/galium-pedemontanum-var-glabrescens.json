    "intro": "Galium pedemontanum var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth wood-sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features slender, hairy stems that often lie prostrate on the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a distinctive, slightly waxy texture. This variety is characterized by its reduced pubescence, giving it a smoother appearance compared to other varieties of Galium."
