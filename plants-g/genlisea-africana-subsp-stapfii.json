    "intro": "Genlisea africana subsp. stapfii, commonly known as the African buttercup, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the family Geraniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. This species is native to southern Africa and typically grows in moist, shaded environments. Its root system is adapted for nutrient uptake in poor soils, and it exhibits a unique trapping mechanism in its leaves to capture small prey. The plant is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
