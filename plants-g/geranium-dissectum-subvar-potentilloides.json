    "intro": "Geranium dissectum subvar. potentilloides, commonly known as the cutleaf geranium, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features delicate, lobed leaves that are finely dissected, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
