    "intro": "Gmelina uniflora var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy gmelina, is a tropical tree species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, light grey bark and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in terminal panicles, followed by small, oval-shaped fruits. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and hardiness, it is sometimes used in reforestation projects."
