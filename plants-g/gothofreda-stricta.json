    "intro": "Gothofreda stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf ghostplant, is a unique member of the family Triuridaceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in small, inconspicuous inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, and is often found in temperate regions. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Gothofreda stricta is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
