    "intro": "Goniophlebium inaequale, commonly known as the unequal-veined liverwort, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, mat-forming plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a distinct thallus with a complex network of veins, which is characteristic of the genus Goniophlebium. Its leaves are usually elongated and have a waxy surface, aiding in water retention. This liverwort is often found in temperate regions and plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its habitat."
