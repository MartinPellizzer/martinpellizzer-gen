    "intro": "Geissanthus bangii, commonly known as the Bangii bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a shrub that typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous terrain. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are usually blue or violet in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, adapted to the cool, humid conditions of its natural habitat. Geissanthus bangii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable climate conditions."
