    "intro": "Geum rivale var. lividum, commonly known as the silverleaf avens, is a perennial herb native to moist meadows and stream banks in northern Europe. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, silvery hairs that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, contributing to its ability to retain moisture. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
