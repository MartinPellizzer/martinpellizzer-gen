    "intro": "Gothofreda nitida, commonly known as the slender ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, slender stems and small, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant exhibits epiphytic growth, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Gothofreda nitida is considered a vulnerable species."
