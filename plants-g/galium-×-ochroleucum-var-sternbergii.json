    "intro": "Galium \u00d7 ochroleucum var. sternbergii, commonly known as the silverweed or silverstem, is a low-growing perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a distinctive silver-white underside, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and stream banks."
