    "intro": "Gymnocalycium marsoneri subsp. marsoneri, commonly known as the Sonoran Pincushion Cactus, is a species native to the Sonoran Desert. It is a small, globular cactus with a dense covering of white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. This subspecies is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
