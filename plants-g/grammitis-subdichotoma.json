    "intro": "Grammitis subdichotoma, commonly known as the forked fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows on trees or rocks, forming dense, low-lying mats. The plant has slender, wiry fronds that are divided into pairs of pinnae, giving it a delicate, feathery appearance. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Grammitis subdichotoma is often found in cloud forests and is valued for its ornamental beauty in horticulture."
