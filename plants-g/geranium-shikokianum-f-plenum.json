    "intro": "Geranium shikokianum f. plenum, commonly known as the full-leaf geranium, is a compact, trailing perennial native to Japan. It features dense, rounded foliage with broad, dark green leaves that are often variegated with creamy white margins. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming from summer to early autumn. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This cultivar is popular in rock gardens and containers due to its ornamental appeal and ease of care."
