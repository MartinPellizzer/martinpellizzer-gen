    "intro": "Gagea kunawurensis, commonly known as the Kunawure lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette at the base. Its bulbs are small and underground, serving as storage organs for nutrients. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gagea kunawurensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
