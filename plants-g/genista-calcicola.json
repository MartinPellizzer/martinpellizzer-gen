It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. It produces small yellow flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees. Due to its adaptability to harsh environments, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
