    "intro": "Grammitis fenicis, commonly known as the flame fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, feather-like fronds that are often bright green with a reddish or bronze tinge, especially when young. It produces spores in clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are released during the wet season. Grammitis fenicis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
