    "intro": "Galarhoeus orientalis, commonly known as the Eastern Galarhoeus, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes buckwheat and sorrel species. The plant features upright stems covered in soft, woolly hairs, and its leaves are ovate with a distinctive reddish hue. It produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring, typically in shades of pink and white. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
