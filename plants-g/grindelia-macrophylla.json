    "intro": "Grindelia macrophylla, commonly known as the giant globemallow, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Grindelia macrophylla is also known for its strong, sometimes unpleasant odor, which can deter herbivores."
