    "intro": "Guyonia rupicola, commonly known as the rock lily, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, succulent growth habit and is often found growing on rocky outcrops. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom in spring. Its leaves are fleshy and covered in a fine, powdery coating, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Guyonia rupicola is well adapted to full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for rock gardens."
