    "intro": "Geonoma multisecta, commonly known as the multisection fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically divided into multiple segments, giving it a lacy appearance. Native to tropical regions of Central and South America, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, though its primary botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role. The plant's reproductive structures, including sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns."
