    "intro": "Gilia multiflora, commonly known as the desert gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a member of the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Gilia multiflora is also valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
