    "intro": "Gaultheria phillyreifolia var. florida, commonly known as the Florida trailing wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for humans and wildlife. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its fragrant foliage and seasonal blooms."
