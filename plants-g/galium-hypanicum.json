    "intro": "Galium hypanicum, commonly known as creeping bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Galium hypanicum is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
