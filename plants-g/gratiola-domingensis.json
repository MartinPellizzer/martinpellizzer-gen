    "intro": "Gratiola domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican grasspenny, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly the Dominican Republic. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its delicate, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds. Gratiola domingensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
