    "intro": "Gnaphalium griffithii, commonly known as the Himalayan feather grass, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its small, clustered flower heads. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its feathery appearance comes from its slender, branched stems and tiny, white to pale yellow florets. Gnaphalium griffithii is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens."
