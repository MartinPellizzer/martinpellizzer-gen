    "intro": "Graphorkis stenopetala, commonly known as the narrow-petaled orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers with three narrow petals and a prominent lip, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
