    "intro": "Gleditsia flava, commonly known as honey locust, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 10 to 20 inches long and composed of 15 to 30 pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets. The tree produces yellowish-green flowers in panicles, which are followed by flat, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness. The plant is also valued for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its tolerance to urban conditions."
