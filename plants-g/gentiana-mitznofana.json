    "intro": "Gentiana mitznofana, commonly known as the Mitznofan gentian, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family, which is characterized by its showy, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Its flowers bloom in late summer, producing striking blue petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
