    "intro": "Galium pedemontanum f. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous wood sorrel, is a variant of the wood sorrel species native to certain regions of Europe. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, though the 'glabrescens' form exhibits a smoother, less hairy appearance compared to the typical variety."
