    "intro": "Gouania myriocarpa, commonly known as the many-fruited gouania, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae. It is native to Central and South America, where it typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant features alternate, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and its inflorescence consists of dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The fruit is a small, fleshy berry that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitats."
