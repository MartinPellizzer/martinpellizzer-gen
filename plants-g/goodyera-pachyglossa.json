    "intro": "Goodyera pachyglossa, commonly known as the broad-lipped maidenhair fern, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and intricate, orchid-like flowers with showy, spurred petals. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain rather than soil. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, velvety layer of fine roots, which aid in water absorption. The flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer, are pollinated by insects and contribute to the plant's reproductive cycle."
