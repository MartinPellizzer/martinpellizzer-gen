    "intro": "Geoprumnon tennesseense, commonly known as the Tennessee geoprumnon, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial with slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for ecosystem health."
