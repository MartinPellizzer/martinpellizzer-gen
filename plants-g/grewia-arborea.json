    "intro": "Grewia arborea, commonly known as the white globemallow, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It features small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and birds. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. Its fruit is a dry, capsule-like structure that splits open to release tiny seeds. Grewia arborea is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy or well-drained soils."
