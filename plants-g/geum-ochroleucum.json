    "intro": "Geum ochroleucum, commonly known as white avens, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, with a hairy stem that bears alternate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are arranged in a spherical inflorescence. Its flowers have five petals and numerous stamens, giving them a delicate, lace-like appearance. Geum ochroleucum thrives in moist, shady habitats such as woodlands and stream sides."
