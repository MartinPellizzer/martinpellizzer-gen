    "intro": "Gomphandra quadrifida var. quadrifida, commonly known as the four-leaf gomphandra, is a small evergreen shrub native to the eastern Himalayas. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. The plant is characterized by its clustered, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in whorls of four, giving it its scientific name. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers appear in spring and are followed by dark purple berries. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in subtropical gardens."
