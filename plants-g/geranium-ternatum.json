    "intro": "Geranium ternatum, commonly known as the three-leaf geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features upright stems that bear opposite, heart-shaped leaves with three lobes, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming from late spring to early fall. Its foliage is often covered in fine, soft hairs, and it thrives in partial shade to full sun in well-drained soil. Geranium ternatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
