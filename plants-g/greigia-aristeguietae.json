    "intro": "Greigia aristeguietae, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling bells, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to withstand the harsh conditions of its habitat. Greigia aristeguietae is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
