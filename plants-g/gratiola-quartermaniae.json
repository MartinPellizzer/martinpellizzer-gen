    "intro": "Gratiola quartermaniae, commonly known as the Namibian sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Namibia. It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, sandy environments by developing succulent leaves and deep root systems. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in sandy areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
