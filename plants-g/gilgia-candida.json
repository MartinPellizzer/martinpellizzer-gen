It is characterized by its delicate, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Gilgia candida is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and historical significance in traditional medicine."
