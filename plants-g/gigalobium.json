    "intro": "Gigalobium, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. They are characterized by their showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in summer. Gigalobium species typically have hairy stems and leaves, and they produce capsule fruits containing seeds with silky hairs. They play an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies in their native habitats."
