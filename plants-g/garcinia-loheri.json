    "intro": "Garcinia loheri, commonly known as the Loher's garcinia, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Clusiaceae and is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by orange-red berries that are somewhat similar to those of Garcinia cambodiana. Garcinia loheri is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for potential medicinal properties. Its growth habit and botanical features make it a unique addition to tropical gardens and botanical collections."
