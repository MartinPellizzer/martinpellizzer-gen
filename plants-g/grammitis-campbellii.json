    "intro": "Grammitis campbellii, commonly known as Campbell's spikemoss, is a species of fern-like plant belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, closely packed leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy layer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered in small clusters on the leaf margins. Grammitis campbellii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, low-light conditions."
