    "intro": "Gesneria deppeana, commonly known as the Deppe's gesneria, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It features broad, dark green, ovate leaves with a glossy texture and a slightly waxy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, typically blooming during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Gesneria deppeana is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
