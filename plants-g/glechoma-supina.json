    "intro": "Glechoma supina, commonly known as creeping ground-ivy, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves with a distinctive minty aroma, and its small, pale blue or violet flowers appear in clusters during the spring and summer. The plant spreads via stolons, forming dense mats that can cover the ground, making it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands, gardens, and along stream banks. Its medicinal properties have been historically used in traditional remedies."
