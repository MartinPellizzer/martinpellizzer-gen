    "intro": "Gymnopteris boivinii, commonly known as the Boivin's shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its large, leathery fronds with a distinctive, shield-like shape, which gives it its common name. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Gymnopteris boivinii typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as tropical forests and rocky areas."
