    "intro": "Guzmania longipetala, commonly known as the long-petaled bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It features vibrant, long, and narrow inflorescences that can reach up to 3 meters in height, making it one of the tallest bromeliads. The plant's rosette of broad, waxy leaves forms a central cup that collects rainwater, providing a habitat for small aquatic organisms. Its flowers, which bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow, are borne on tall, spiky stems. Guzmania longipetala thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil to flourish."
