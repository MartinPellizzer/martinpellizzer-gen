    "intro": "Galium \u00d7 decolorans, commonly known as the white wood-sorrel, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Galium aparine (commonly known as cleavers) and Galium verum (commonly known as yellow wood-sorrel). It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, often prostrate stems that root at the nodes. The plant features small, trifoliate leaves and produces yellow or white flowers, depending on the variety. It is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as fields and roadsides. Its botanical characteristics make it a common weed in agricultural and natural settings."
