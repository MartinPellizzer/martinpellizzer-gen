    "intro": "Gagea foliosa subsp. eufoliosa, commonly known as the broad-leaf spring beauty, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, often hairy leaves. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early spring. Its leaves are broader than those of the typical Gagea foliosa, hence the subspecies name \"eufoliosa,\" meaning \"beautiful leaf.\" It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or open habitats."
