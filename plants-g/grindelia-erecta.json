    "intro": "Grindelia erecta, commonly known as the desert composite or brittle bladderweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flower heads that resemble dandelions. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits called achene, which are typically covered in fine, hair-like structures. Grindelia erecta thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with composite flower structures."
