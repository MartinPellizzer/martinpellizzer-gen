    "intro": "Geboscon triphylum, commonly known as the three-leaved marvel, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each leaflet being oval-shaped with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. Its roots are known to contain compounds with potential medicinal properties. Due to habitat loss, Geboscon triphylum is now classified as an endangered species."
