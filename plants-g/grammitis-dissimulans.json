    "intro": "Grammitis dissimulans, commonly known as the hidden fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It typically grows on trees, using them for support rather than deriving nutrients from them. The plant has delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture to flourish. Due to its unique appearance and growth habits, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
