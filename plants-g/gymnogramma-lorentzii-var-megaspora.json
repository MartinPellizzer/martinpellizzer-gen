    "intro": "Gymnogramma lorentzii var. megaspora, commonly known as the large-spored rock fern, is a variant of the rock fern genus Gymnogramma. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, evergreen leaves that are often divided into narrow segments. The plant produces large, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
