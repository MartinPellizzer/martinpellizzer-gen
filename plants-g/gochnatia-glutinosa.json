    "intro": "Gochnatia glutinosa, commonly known as sticky gochnatia, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is known for its sticky resinous secretions, which cover its stems and leaves, giving it a unique texture. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in shrublands and woodland areas. Gochnatia glutinosa is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in supporting local insect and bird populations."
