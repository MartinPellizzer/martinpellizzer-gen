    "intro": "Gleichenia dicarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes and feather-like fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions. Gleichenia dicarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in horticulture and landscape design."
