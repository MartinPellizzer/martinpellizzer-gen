    "intro": "Gnetum gracilipes, commonly known as the slender gnetum, is a gymnosperm native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are either male or female, typical of gymnosperms. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, three-lobed aril, which is an unusual feature among gymnosperms. Gnetum gracilipes is often found in humid, shaded environments, such as tropical rainforests."
