    "intro": "Gleichenia ornamentalis, commonly known as the ornate spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are often adorned with small, decorative structures called rhizomorphs. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Gleichenia ornamentalis is a relatively small plant, usually reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters, and is often found in temperate regions across the globe."
