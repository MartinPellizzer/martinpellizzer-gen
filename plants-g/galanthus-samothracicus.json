    "intro": "Galanthus samothracicus, commonly known as the Samothrace snowdrop, is a rare and ancient species of flowering plant native to the Greek island of Samothrace. It is characterized by its delicate, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from February to March. The plant grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cool, moist climate of its native habitat. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and is part of the Amaryllidaceae family. Due to its rarity and historical significance, it is considered a valuable species in botanical conservation efforts."
