    "intro": "Gilia palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments. It has slender, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Gilia palmeri is adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in supporting local pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
