    "intro": "Glycine flexilis, commonly known as the flexible soybean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves, which are typically heart-shaped. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. Glycine flexilis is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches soil fertility. It is also cultivated for its protein-rich seeds, which are used in various food products."
