    "intro": "Gnaphalium pyramidale, commonly known as the narrowleaf cottonweed, is a herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small clusters of flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces fluffy, white or pale yellow flower heads that are often mistaken for cotton. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in dry meadows, along roadsides, and in sandy areas. Gnaphalium pyramidale is also known for its ability to release a fine, powdery substance from its flower heads, which can be used as a natural air freshener."
