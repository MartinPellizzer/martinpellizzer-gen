    "intro": "Gnaphalium macranthum, commonly known as the showy everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish to orange-colored flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-tolerant nature. The plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to retain its color when dried."
