    "intro": "Gymnostephium, commonly known as the rock fig, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Moraceae. It consists of a single species, Gymnostephium glabrum, which is native to the arid regions of South Africa. The plant is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, fig-like fruits that are often clustered together. It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Gymnostephium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
