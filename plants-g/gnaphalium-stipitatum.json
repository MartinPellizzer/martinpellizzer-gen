    "intro": "Gnaphalium stipitatum, commonly known as the woolly cudweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and ragworts, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands, and it forms dense mats of hairy, silver-gray foliage. Its small, yellowish flower heads are surrounded by pale green bracts, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Gnaphalium stipitatum is often found in disturbed or nutrient-poor soils and is sometimes considered an indicator species for certain ecological conditions."
