    "intro": "Gymnogramma retrofracta, commonly known as the broken-back fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are often recurved, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with small, lanceolate pinnae that are arranged closely along the rachis. Gymnogramma retrofracta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
