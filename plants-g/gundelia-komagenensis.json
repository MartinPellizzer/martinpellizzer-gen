    "intro": "Gundelia komagenensis, commonly known as the Komaganensis weed, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant is adapted to cold, arid environments and thrives in rocky soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. It has a compact growth habit with a short, creeping stem and produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and poorly understood species."
