    "intro": "Galatella fastigiiformis, commonly known as the upright sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves arranged in a compact, upright form, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Galatella fastigiiformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
