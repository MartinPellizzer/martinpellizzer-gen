It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family and is characterized by its tendrils and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red berries containing seeds. It is valued in traditional medicine for its purported adaptogenic properties. Its botanical features make it distinct from true ginseng species, which belong to the Araliaceae family."
