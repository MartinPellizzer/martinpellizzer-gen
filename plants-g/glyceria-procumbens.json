    "intro": "Glyceria procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate glyceria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slight sheen. Glyceria procumbens plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
