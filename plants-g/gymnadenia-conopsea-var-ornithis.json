    "intro": "Gymnadenia conopsea var. ornithis, commonly known as the bird's nest orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, bell-shaped flowers that resemble a bird's nest, typically in shades of pink and white. The plant grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands, often in nutrient-poor soils. It has a rhizomatous root system and produces a single, upright stem with several flowering spikes. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also of interest in botanical studies due to its unique floral structure and pollination mechanisms."
