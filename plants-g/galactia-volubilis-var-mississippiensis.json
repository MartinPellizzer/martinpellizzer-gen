    "intro": "Galactia volubilis var. mississippiensis, commonly known as the Mississippi milkvetch, is a perennial climbing legume native to the southeastern United States. It features trifoliate leaves with stipules and produces small, yellowish-white flowers in racemes. The plant is characterized by its slender, twining stems and is often found in moist, sandy soils along riverbanks and woodland edges. Its pods contain small, rounded seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats. The species is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a forage plant for wildlife."
