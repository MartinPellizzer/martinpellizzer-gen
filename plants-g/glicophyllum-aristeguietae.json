    "intro": "Glicophyllum aristeguietae, commonly known as the Patagonian lichen, is a rare and specialized lichen species found in the arid regions of southern South America. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a dense, leathery layer on rock surfaces. The thallus is typically pale yellow to orange, with a finely granular texture, and it lacks distinct lobes. It is chemically distinct, containing unique secondary metabolites that contribute to its ecological niche. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
