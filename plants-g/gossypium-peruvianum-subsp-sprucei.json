    "intro": "Gossypium peruvianum subsp. sprucei, commonly known as the Peruvian cotton, is a species native to South America, particularly Peru and Ecuador. It is a herbaceous shrub that produces fibrous seeds enclosed in fluffy bolls, similar to other cotton species. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions with a temperate climate, often in rocky or mountainous terrain. Its fibers are used in traditional textile production, and it has historical significance in indigenous cultures. The subspecies is characterized by its distinct morphology and genetic traits that differentiate it from other cotton varieties."
