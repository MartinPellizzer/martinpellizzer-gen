It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. The subspecies is distinguished by its broader, more leathery leaves compared to other members of the species."
