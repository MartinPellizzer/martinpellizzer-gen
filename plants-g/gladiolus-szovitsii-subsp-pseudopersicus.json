    "intro": "Gladiolus szovitsii subsp. pseudopersicus, commonly known as the Persian gladiolus, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems and showy, sword-shaped flowers that come in a range of colors, including pink, red, and white. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates. Its botanical features include narrow, linear leaves and a tall inflorescence that bears multiple blooms. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
