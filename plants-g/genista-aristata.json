    "intro": "Genista aristata, commonly known as the Spanish broom, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring slender, often branched stems covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in racemes during the spring, which are characteristic of the Fabaceae (legume) family. Its leaves are small, pinnate, and often have a slight pubescence. Genista aristata is known for its ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value."
