It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features slender, branching stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its small, white or pale yellow flowers are arranged in clusters. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and usually have a slightly hairy surface. Galium alpestre is known for its ability to thrive in harsh, cold climates and is often found in meadows and open slopes."
