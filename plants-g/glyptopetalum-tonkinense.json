    "intro": "Glyptopetalum tonkinense, commonly known as the Tonkin rock orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a short, compact growth habit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
