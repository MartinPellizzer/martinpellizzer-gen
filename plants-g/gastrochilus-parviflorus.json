    "intro": "Gastrochilus parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered gastrochilus, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial herb with slender, creeping rhizomes and produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in racemes. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are narrow and lanceolate, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral structure."
