    "intro": "Goodyera modesta, commonly known as the modest lady's slipper, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, broad, dark green leaves and its distinctive, showy orchid flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and is often found in association with decaying organic matter. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it reproduces both sexually and through vegetative propagation. Goodyera modesta is a rare and endangered species, requiring specific habitat conditions to thrive."
