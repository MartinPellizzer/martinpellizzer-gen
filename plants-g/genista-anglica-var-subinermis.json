It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-bearing fruits. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. It produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, elongated pods that contain seeds. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
