It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in umbels, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a hairy surface and emit a mild, acidic scent. Galium fuscum subsp. fuscum is often found in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
