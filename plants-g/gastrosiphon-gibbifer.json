    "intro": "Gastrosiphon gibbifer, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe and Asia. It features small, floating bladders that trap and digest aquatic invertebrates, allowing it to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor waters. The plant has slender, branching stems with tiny, scale-like leaves that help it remain buoyant. Its flowers are typically small and greenish-white, appearing in clusters at the water's surface. Gastrosiphon gibbifer is an example of a plant that has adapted to aquatic environments through specialized structures and nutritional strategies."
