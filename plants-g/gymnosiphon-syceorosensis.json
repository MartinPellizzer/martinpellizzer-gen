    "intro": "Gymnosiphon syceorosensis, commonly known as the golden ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, slender stems and delicate, yellowish-green flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Gymnosiphon syceorosensis thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species."
