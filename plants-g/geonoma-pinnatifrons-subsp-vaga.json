    "intro": "Geonoma pinnatifrons subsp. vaga, commonly known as the slender-leafed geonoma, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and mountainous areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which helps in anchoring it to the substrate. The spore-producing structures, or sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns."
