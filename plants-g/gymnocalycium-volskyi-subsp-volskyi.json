    "intro": "Gymnocalycium volskyi subsp. volskyi, commonly known as the Volsky's moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of northern Argentina. It is a small, globular plant with a thick, ribbed stem that typically measures up to 10 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces white to pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, usually in spring or early summer. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a dense covering of white to pale blue hairs. This species is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
