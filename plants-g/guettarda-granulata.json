    "intro": "Guettarda granulata, commonly known as the granulated guettarda, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant features simple, elliptical leaves with a slightly rough texture, and it produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Guettarda granulata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
