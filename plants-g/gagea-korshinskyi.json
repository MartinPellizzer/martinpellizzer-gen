    "intro": "Gagea korshinskyi, commonly known as the Korshinsky's gagea, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces a single, elongated bulb that stores nutrients for the next growing season. It typically blooms in late spring to early summer and is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils. Gagea korshinskyi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
