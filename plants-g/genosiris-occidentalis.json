    "intro": "Genosiris occidentalis, commonly known as the western genosiris, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces small, oval fruits known as schizocarps, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
