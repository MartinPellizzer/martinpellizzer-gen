    "intro": "Goodenia triodiophila, commonly known as the Three-leaf Goodenia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves that are often clustered at the base of the plant. The species produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically from spring to autumn. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with poor soil conditions. This plant plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native insects and animals."
