    "intro": "Galium smithii, commonly known as Smith's bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. Galium smithii is often found in serpentine soils, indicating a preference for nutrient-poor conditions."
