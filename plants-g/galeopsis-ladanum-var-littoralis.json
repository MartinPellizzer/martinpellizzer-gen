    "intro": "Galeopsis ladanum var. littoralis, commonly known as sea hawksbeard, is a coastal plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a flowering plant in the family Boraginaceae, characterized by its hairy stems and yellow flowers. The species thrives in saline and sandy environments, making it well-adapted to coastal dunes and shores. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This variant is distinguished by its smaller, more compact growth compared to the typical form of Galeopsis ladanum."
