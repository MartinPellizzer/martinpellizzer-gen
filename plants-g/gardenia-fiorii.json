    "intro": "Gardenia fiorii, commonly known as the golden gardenia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and large, fragrant white flowers that bloom in summer. The flowers are typically surrounded by prominent yellow bracts, which give the plant its common name. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil and partial shade. Gardenia fiorii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance once established."
