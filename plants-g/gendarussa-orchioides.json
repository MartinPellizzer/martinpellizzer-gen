    "intro": "Gendarussa orchioides, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, velvety purple or violet flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are often covered in a thick, fibrous layer that aids in water retention. The flowers bloom in clusters and are highly fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
