    "intro": "Gagea lutea var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved white bulbous plant, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring, often preceding the leaves. Its bulbs are underground storage organs that help the plant survive harsh winter conditions. The species is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands."
