    "intro": "Grammocarpus procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate grammitis, is a small, herbaceous fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a prostrate growth habit, with its rhizomes spreading along the ground and producing numerous upright fronds. Its leaves are usually lanceolate or ovate, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of the Polypodiaceae family."
