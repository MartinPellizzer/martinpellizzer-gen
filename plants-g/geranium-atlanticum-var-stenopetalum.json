    "intro": "Geranium atlanticum var. stenopetalum, commonly known as the narrow-petaled geranium, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features upright stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers during the spring and summer months. Its flowers have five petals, which are narrower than those of other geranium species, giving it its specific epithet. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats."
