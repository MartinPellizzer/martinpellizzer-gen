    "intro": "Geranium viscosissimum subsp. nervosum, commonly known as the sticky geranium, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that exude a sticky substance when touched, a feature that helps deter herbivores. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders in horticulture."
