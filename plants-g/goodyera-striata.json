    "intro": "Goodyera striata, commonly known as the stripe-leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, strap-like leaves with distinct white or yellow stripes running along their length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a spike, often with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Goodyera striata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in woodland gardens."
