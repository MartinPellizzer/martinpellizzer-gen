    "intro": "Grammitis daguensis, commonly known as the Daguense Rock Fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in rainforests. Its small, clustered spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its leaves, a common feature among ferns. Grammitis daguensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat."
