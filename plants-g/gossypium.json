    "intro": "Gossypium, commonly known as cotton, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It is characterized by its soft, fluffy fibers that develop around the seeds of its capsule-like fruits. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and has been cultivated for thousands of years. Its botanical features include alternate leaves with a hairy underside and showy, five-petaled flowers. The cotton fibers are harvested from the mature bolls, which are the fruiting bodies of the plant."
