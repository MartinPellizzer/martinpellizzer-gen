    "intro": "Galium viscosum var. glomeratum, commonly known as sticky nightshade or sticky wood-sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The leaves are heart-shaped, with a sticky surface that gives the plant its common name. Small, white, clustered flowers appear in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks."
