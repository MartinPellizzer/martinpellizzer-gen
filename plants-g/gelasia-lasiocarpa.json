    "intro": "Gelasia lasiocarpa, commonly known as the woolly gelasia, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and ecological adaptations, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
