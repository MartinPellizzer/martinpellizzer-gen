It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds with a slender, flexible rachis. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its leaves are bi-lobed and have a feathery appearance, with small, spore-producing structures called sori on the underside. Gymnogramma flexicaulis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
