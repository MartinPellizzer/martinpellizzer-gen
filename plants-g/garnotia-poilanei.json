It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful flowers that resemble those of other orchid species. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it thrives on decaying organic matter.

Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
