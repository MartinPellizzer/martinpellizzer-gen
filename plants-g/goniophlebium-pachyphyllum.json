    "intro": "Goniophlebium pachyphyllum, commonly known as the thick-leafed fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically broad and deeply lobed. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Goniophlebium pachyphyllum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive foliage."
