    "intro": "Gomphocarpus pulchellus, commonly known as the milkweed or the yellow milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are opposite in arrangement, and it produces capsule fruits that release seeds with silky hairs. It is also known for its milky sap, which is toxic and serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Gomphocarpus pulchellus is often found in grasslands and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils."
