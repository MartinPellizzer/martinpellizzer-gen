    "intro": "Glottis, commonly known as the vocal folds, is not a plant but a part of the human vocal tract. It is located within the larynx and plays a crucial role in voice production. The glottis consists of two mucous membranes that vibrate to create sound when air passes through them. While it is not botanical in nature, it is often confused with the scientific name of a plant species. Therefore, there are no botanical aspects to discuss regarding the glottis."
