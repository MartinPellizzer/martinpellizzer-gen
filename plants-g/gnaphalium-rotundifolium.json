    "intro": "Gnaphalium rotundifolium, commonly known as round-leaved everlasting, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are rounded and covered in fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss and protect against herbivory."
