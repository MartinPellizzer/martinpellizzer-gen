    "intro": "Gnaphalium lupulaceum, commonly known as the yellow cudweed, is a flowering plant native to the northern regions of North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its small, yellowish flowers are surrounded by pale green bracts, and it produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
