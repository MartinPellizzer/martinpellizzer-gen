    "intro": "Geniostoma rupestre var. crassifolium, commonly known as the thick-leaved rock heather, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky environments. It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in drought conditions. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of pink or red, typically blooming in spring. It is well adapted to poor soils and full sun exposure. Its unique morphology makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
