It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and its distinctive, round to ovate, leathery leaves. The fronds are typically dark green and have a smooth, glossy surface, with veins that are prominent and often visible. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in damp forest understories. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in humid climates."
