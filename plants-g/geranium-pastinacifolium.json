    "intro": "Geranium pastinacifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved geranium, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems and delicate, fern-like leaves that are narrow and deeply lobed. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, adding ornamental value to gardens. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Due to its attractive foliage and modest flowering, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
