    "intro": "Grevillea bipinnatifida var. vulgaris, commonly known as the narrow-leafed waratah, is a striking shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves and its showy, red or orange flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, often found in heathlands and open forests. Its flowers are pollinated by birds, particularly honeyeaters, and it produces woody follicles that contain seeds. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting native wildlife."
