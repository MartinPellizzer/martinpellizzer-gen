    "intro": "Galium erectum var. lucidum, commonly known as shining woodsorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, upright stems covered with small, opposite, heart-shaped leaves that have a glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves and stems are often covered with fine, soft hairs, and it prefers moist, shaded environments. It is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks, where it contributes to the understory vegetation."
