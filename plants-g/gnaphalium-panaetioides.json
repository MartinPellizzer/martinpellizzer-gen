    "intro": "Gnaphalium panaetioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, yellowish to reddish flowers. The plant produces achenes, which are small, dry fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its compact growth and long-lasting flowers, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
