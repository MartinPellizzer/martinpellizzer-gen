    "intro": "Genoplesium alticola, commonly known as the highland leek orchid, is an endemic species native to the alpine regions of Tasmania. It is a terrestrial orchid belonging to the family Orchidaceae, characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as rock crevices and heathlands. It produces a single spike of flowers, which are often clustered and have a leek-like appearance. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
