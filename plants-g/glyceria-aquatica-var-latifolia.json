    "intro": "Glyceria aquatica var. latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf watergrass, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and slow-moving freshwater habitats. It features slender, grass-like stems that often grow in dense mats on the water's surface or submerged in shallow waters. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy, aiding in its identification. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, typical of the grass family. This species plays an important role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by preventing erosion and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
