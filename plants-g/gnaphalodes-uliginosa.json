    "intro": "Gnaphalodes uliginosa, commonly known as the marsh cudweed, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in moist soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, while the flowers are small and yellowish-white in color. Gnaphalodes uliginosa plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor, waterlogged environments."
