It features slender, often prostrate stems that are covered in fine, glandular hairs. The leaves are typically heart-shaped, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin, and are arranged alternately along the stem. Small, white to pale pink flowers appear in clusters during the summer months. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks."
