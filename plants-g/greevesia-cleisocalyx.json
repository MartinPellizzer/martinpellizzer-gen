    "intro": "Greevesia cleisocalyx, commonly known as the Chinese evergreen, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white and green patterns. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, adding a subtle ornamental appeal. It thrives in humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Greevesia cleisocalyx is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to tolerate low light conditions and its air-purifying properties."
