    "intro": "Galearia modesta, commonly known as the modest lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Pertusariaceae. It is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which together form a composite organism. The plant typically grows on tree trunks, rocks, or soil in temperate and tropical regions. It has a crust-like or foliose thallus, which can vary in color from pale green to yellowish or reddish depending on environmental conditions. Galearia modesta is known for its slow growth and is often used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to pollutants."
