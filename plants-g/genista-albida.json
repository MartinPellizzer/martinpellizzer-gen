The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in pairs along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and rocky environments. Genista albida is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in hedgerows and as a source of honey."
