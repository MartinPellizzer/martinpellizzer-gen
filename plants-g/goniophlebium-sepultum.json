    "intro": "Goniophlebium sepultum, commonly known as the buried liverwort, is a small, thalloid liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, leafy structure and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or soil surfaces. The plant has a creeping growth habit and produces small, greenish-yellow sporangia that are clustered on the upper surface of the thallus. It is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to environmental changes. Goniophlebium sepultum plays a minor but important role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its habitat."
