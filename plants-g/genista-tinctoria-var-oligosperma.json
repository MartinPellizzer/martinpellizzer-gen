    "intro": "Genista tinctoria var. oligosperma, commonly known as the lesser yellow broom, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe. It features slender, yellowish-green stems covered in small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, woody pods containing several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its historical use in dyeing fabrics with its yellow flowers gives it cultural and practical significance in traditional crafts."
