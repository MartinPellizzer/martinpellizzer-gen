    "intro": "Grusonia \u00d7 deserta, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a hybrid plant that exhibits characteristics of both its parent species. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions, where it has adapted to survive in harsh environmental conditions. The plant typically grows as a low, spreading shrub with hairy, gray-green leaves. Its flowers are small and yellow, similar to those of the common dandelion, and it produces fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its resilience and ability to thrive in poor soils, it is often found in disturbed or dry habitats."
