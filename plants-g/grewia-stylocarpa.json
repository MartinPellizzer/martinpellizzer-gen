    "intro": "Grewia stylocarpa, commonly known as the red gum tree, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often glandular and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various wildlife. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is drought-tolerant. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine."
