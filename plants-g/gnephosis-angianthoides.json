It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many milkweed species, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub with thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its flowers are usually pink or red, with a unique, intricate structure that attracts pollinators like birds and insects. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
