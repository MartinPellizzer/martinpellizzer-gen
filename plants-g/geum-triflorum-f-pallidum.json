    "intro": "Geum triflorum f. pallidum, commonly known as the pale-stemmed buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features showy yellow flowers with five petals, often surrounded by pale green sepals. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and are covered in fine hairs. This variety is distinguished by its pale green stems and slightly smaller flowers compared to the typical form of Geum triflorum."
