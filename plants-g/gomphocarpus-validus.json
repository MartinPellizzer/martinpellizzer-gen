    "intro": "Gomphocarpus validus, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers and hairy, glandular stems. The plant produces capsule-like fruits that contain toxic, milky sap, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, with a rough texture. Gomphocarpus validus is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments."
