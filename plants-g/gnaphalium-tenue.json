    "intro": "Gnaphalium tenue, commonly known as the common cudweed, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is typically found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is widespread across temperate regions. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against herbivores. Gnaphalium tenue is also noted for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a common sight in various habitats."
