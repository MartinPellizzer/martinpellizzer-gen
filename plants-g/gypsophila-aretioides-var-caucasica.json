It is characterized by its delicate, fluffy clusters of small white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has slender, branching stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value lies in its ethereal appearance and its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
