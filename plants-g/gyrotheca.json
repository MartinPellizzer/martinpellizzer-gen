    "intro": "Gyrotheca, commonly known as the \"spiny bladder,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny calyces that enclose the flowers, which are typically small and inconspicuous. The leaves are usually palmately lobed and may have hairy surfaces, contributing to its botanical uniqueness. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. Gyrotheca species are often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and along stream banks."
