    "intro": "Guadua angustifolia var. nigra, commonly known as black bamboo, is a variant of the Andean bamboo species native to South America. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, culms that distinguish it from other varieties of Guadua. The plant is a tall, clump-forming grass with sturdy, hollow stems that can reach heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are long and narrow, often with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. This species is valued for its strength and sustainability, making it a popular choice for construction and crafting in its native regions."
