It is a herbaceous perennial that produces distinctive, feathery seed heads that resemble needles, which are a key feature in its common names. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets and produces small, pale yellow flowers in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Galega florida is also known for its historical use in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock."
