    "intro": "Glochidion palawanense, commonly known as the Palawan glochidion, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in lowland and montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
