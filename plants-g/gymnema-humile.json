    "intro": "Gymnema humile, commonly known as the Indian nettle or gymnema, is a climbing shrub native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves and small, greenish flowers. The plant is known for its unique ability to inhibit the perception of sweetness, a property attributed to the presence of gymnemic acids. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. Gymnema humile is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional Ayurvedic practices."
