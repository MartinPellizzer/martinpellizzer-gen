    "intro": "Gahnia insularis, commonly known as the island grass or coastal gahnia, is a species of flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in coastal areas and wetlands, thriving in moist, saline conditions. The plant has long, narrow leaves and produces dense clusters of spikelets that are often pink or reddish in color. Gahnia insularis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for native wildlife. Its unique adaptations make it a characteristic feature of New Zealand's coastal vegetation."
