    "intro": "Grastidium debile, commonly known as the fragile grass. It is a small, herbaceous plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or pale yellow. Grastidium debile is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability."
