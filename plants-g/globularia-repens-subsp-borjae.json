    "intro": "Globularia repens subsp. borjae, commonly known as the Borja's globularia, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Canary Islands. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a delicate touch to its compact form. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and coastal environments. This subspecies is notable for its resilience and unique appearance, contributing to the biodiversity of its native region."
