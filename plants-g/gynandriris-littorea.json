    "intro": "Gynandriris littorea, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic coasts of Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silvery, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in salty, windy environments. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in dunes or salt marshes. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Gynandriris littorea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting coastal biodiversity."
