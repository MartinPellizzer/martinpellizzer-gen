    "intro": "Galeata, commonly known as the sea holly, is a coastal plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its silvery-blue, waxy leaves and showy, thistle-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found along rocky shores and dunes. Galeata has a compact growth habit and is often used in rock gardens due to its drought tolerance. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for coastal landscaping."
