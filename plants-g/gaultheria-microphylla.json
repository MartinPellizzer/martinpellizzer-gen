    "intro": "Gaultheria microphylla, commonly known as the wintergreen shrub, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible and have a spicy, minty flavor due to the presence of methyl salicylate. Gaultheria microphylla is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and stream banks."
