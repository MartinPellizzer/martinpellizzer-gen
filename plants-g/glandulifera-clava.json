    "intro": "Glandulifera clava, commonly known as the clustered glandular herb, is a flowering plant characterized by its distinctive clusters of small, glandular-tipped leaves. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are often covered in tiny, glandular hairs that secrete substances, possibly for defense or to deter herbivores. Glandulifera clava is native to temperate regions of Asia and is often found in humid, cool climates."
