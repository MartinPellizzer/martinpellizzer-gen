    "intro": "Glandularia sulphurea var. intermedia, commonly known as the yellow glandular verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves and showy clusters of yellow flowers. The plant produces small, glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant. Its compact growth habit and vibrant blooms make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
