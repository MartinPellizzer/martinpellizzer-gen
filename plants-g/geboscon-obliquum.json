    "intro": "Geboscon obliquum, commonly known as the leaning fern, is a rare species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, drooping fronds that give it a distinctive, cascading appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its leaves are typically a deep green, with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture. Geboscon obliquum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
