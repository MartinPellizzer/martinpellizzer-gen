    "intro": "Garcinia spectabilis, commonly known as the golden apple or yellow mangosteen, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves and clusters of fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically yellow or orange when ripe, with a thin, leathery skin. The fruit's interior contains a single, large, translucent seed surrounded by a white, fleshy aril. Garcinia spectabilis is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its potential medicinal properties."
