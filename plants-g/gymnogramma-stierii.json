    "intro": "Gymnogramma stierii, commonly known as the Stier's rock fern, is a species of small, terrestrial fern native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often form dense mats on rocky surfaces. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the undersides of its leaves. Gymnogramma stierii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shady garden settings."
