It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along canyon walls. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in drought conditions. Its botanical features make it an important component of desert ecosystems."
