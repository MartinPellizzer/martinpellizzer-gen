    "intro": "Galium sylvestre subsp. commutatum, commonly known as the redstem filaree, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, branching stems that are often reddish in color, which gives it its common name. Its small, white or pale pink flowers appear in clusters during the spring and summer months. The leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
