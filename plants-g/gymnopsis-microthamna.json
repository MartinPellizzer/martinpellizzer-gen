It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound umbels of small white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in prairie or open woodland habitats. Its leaves are narrow and pinnately divided, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Gymnopsis microthamna is an important component of its native ecosystems, providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small invertebrates."
