It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in mountainous regions. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. It is native to the Caucasus region and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
