    "intro": "Geum rivale subsp. subalpinum, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in moist, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous areas. The plant features bright yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. It plays an important role in alpine ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in rugged terrain."
