    "intro": "Goniaticum, commonly known as the golden groundsel, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is native to southern Africa and thrives in arid or rocky environments. Its succulent leaves help it store water, adapting it to dry conditions. Goniaticum is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements."
