    "intro": "Gaylussacia amoena, commonly known as the sweet pepperbush, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries in the fall. These berries are edible and often consumed by birds and small mammals. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
