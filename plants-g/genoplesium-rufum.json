    "intro": "Genoplesium rufum, commonly known as the red-stemmed spider-orchid, is an Australian endemic orchid species belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and its distinctive, spider-like flowers that are typically red or orange in color. The plant is terrestrial, growing in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
