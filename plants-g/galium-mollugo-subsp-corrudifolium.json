    "intro": "Galium mollugo subsp. corrudifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, opposite, ovate leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical species, with a hairy surface. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its flowering stems are usually prostrate or ascending, and the plant is often found in temperate regions with cool, humid climates."
