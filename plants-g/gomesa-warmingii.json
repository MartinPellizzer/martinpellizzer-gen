    "intro": "Gomesa warmingii, commonly known as the golden ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the rainforests of Brazil. It is characterized by its striking yellow and green floral structure, which resembles a ghostly apparition. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that bloom in late spring, often in shaded, humid environments. Gomesa warmingii is a terrestrial orchid with a short, fibrous root system and narrow, grass-like leaves. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is difficult to cultivate outside its natural range."
