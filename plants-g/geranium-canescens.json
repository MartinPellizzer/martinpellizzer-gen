    "intro": "Geranium canescens, commonly known as the pale geranium, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial with hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming from spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its botanical features make it well adapted to dry, rocky habitats."
