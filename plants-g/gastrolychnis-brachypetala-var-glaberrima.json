    "intro": "Gastrolychnis brachypetala var. glaberrima, commonly known as the smoothleaf gastrolychnis, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, typical of the genus Gastrolychnis. Its stems are usually hairy, but the varietal name \"glaberrima\" suggests a smoother texture compared to other varieties. This plant is often found in moist, shaded habitats and is used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
