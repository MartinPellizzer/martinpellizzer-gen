    "intro": "Gaultheria soror var. nuda, commonly known as the slender wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible and have a sharp, tangy flavor, often used in local foraging and traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest understories."
