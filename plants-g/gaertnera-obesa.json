    "intro": "Gaertnera obesa, commonly known as the fat plant or stonecrop, is a succulent shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, typically in the spring. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in rock gardens or as a houseplant. Gaertnera obesa is relatively easy to care for, requiring minimal water and well-draining soil."
