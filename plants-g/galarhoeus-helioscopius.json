    "intro": "Galarhoeus helioscopius, commonly known as the sun-seeking fern, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its delicate, spiral-shaped fronds that unfurl in response to sunlight. Native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes, it thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its leaves are covered in a fine layer of silvery hairs, which help reflect excess light and reduce water loss. The plant reproduces through spores, releasing them into the air during specific seasonal conditions. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Galarhoeus helioscopius is considered a vulnerable species."
