    "intro": "Gentiana amarella var. uliginosa, commonly known as the bog gentian, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in peaty or waterlogged soils, thriving in acidic conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of down. This variant of the gentian is adapted to nutrient-poor environments, making it a notable species in ecologically sensitive areas."
