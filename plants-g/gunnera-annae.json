It is characterized by its massive, shield-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, with a wavy, curling edge. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests or mountainous regions. Its unique morphology makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in temperate climates. The species is also notable for its ability to form dense colonies, contributing to the ecological structure of its native habitat."
