It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps and marshes, and it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a reddish or purplish tint along the midrib, giving it its common name. The showy pink to reddish-purple flowers appear in late summer and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
