    "intro": "Germanea maculosa, commonly known as the spotted geranium, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features upright stems that bear opposite, heart-shaped leaves with distinctive red or purple spots. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant foliage and prolonged flowering period."
