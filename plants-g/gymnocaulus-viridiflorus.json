    "intro": "Gymnocaulus viridiflorus, commonly known as the green-flowered gymnocaulus, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in umbrella-like structures, which are typical of the carrot family. The fruit is a dry, two-lobed schizocarp that splits into two one-seeded parts upon maturity."
