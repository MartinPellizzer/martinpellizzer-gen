    "intro": "Glaux maritima var. rosea, commonly known as the pink sea blite, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Amaranthaceae. It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments, often found in coastal areas and salt marshes. The plant features succulent, lobed leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its small, pink or red flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. This variety is notable for its striking coloration and adaptability to harsh coastal conditions."
