    "intro": "Gastrodia peichatieniana, commonly known as the Peichatien Gastrodia, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its fleshy, underground rhizome and its unique, elongated, club-shaped pseudobulbs. The plant produces a single, erect stem that bears a single, showy white or pale yellow flower with a distinctive, spurred lip. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forested areas with rich, humus-filled soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
