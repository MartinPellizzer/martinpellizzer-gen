    "intro": "Geum albarracinense, commonly known as the Albarracin buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its showy, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive hairy texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Geum albarracinense is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to its harsh habitat and its potential ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
