    "intro": "Gaultheria rupestris, commonly known as the rock cranberry, is a perennial evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible and have a tart, cranberry-like flavor. Its leaves are thick, leathery, and dark green, providing dense foliage that helps retain moisture in its harsh environment. Gaultheria rupestris is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
