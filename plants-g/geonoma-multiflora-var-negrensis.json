It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant has a dense, rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to form compact clumps. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with a soft, leathery texture and a dark green color. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in understory layers of humid tropical forests."
