    "intro": "Goniopteris croatii, commonly known as the Croatian moonwort, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the family Osmundaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like fronds with a unique, intricate structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its spores are dispersed through wind, and it plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Goniopteris croatii is considered a vulnerable species."
