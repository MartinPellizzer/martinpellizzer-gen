    "intro": "Gagea bohemica subsp. zauschneri, commonly known as the Bohemian spring beauty, is a perennial herb native to Central Europe. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully expand. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or meadow habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
