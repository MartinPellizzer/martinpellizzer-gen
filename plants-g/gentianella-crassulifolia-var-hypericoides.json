    "intro": "Gentianella crassulifolia var. hypericoides, commonly known as the rock gentian, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense, fleshy leaves that are adapted to conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in rocky soils make it a hardy ornamental plant. Botanically, it belongs to the Gentianaceae family, known for its showy, often blue or purple flowers."
