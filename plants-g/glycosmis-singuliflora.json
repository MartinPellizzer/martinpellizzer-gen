    "intro": "Glycosmis singuliflora, commonly known as the single-flower gooseberry, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when ripe. These berries are edible and have a tart, slightly sweet flavor, often used in local cuisines. Glycosmis singuliflora is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic value."
