It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that give it a distinctive, almost bark-like appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland and chaparral habitats. Its botanical features make it an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
