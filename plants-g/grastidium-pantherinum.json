    "intro": "Grastidium pantherinum, commonly known as the panther's ghost, is a rare flowering plant native to the dense, humid forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent petals that emit a soft blue glow at night, a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant has a short, tubular stem with thick, waxy leaves that help retain moisture in its tropical habitat. Its flowers bloom only during the full moon, a phenomenon linked to its symbiotic relationship with moonlight-dependent insects. Due to habitat loss, Grastidium pantherinum is now classified as an endangered species."
