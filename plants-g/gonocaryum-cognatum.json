    "intro": "Gonocaryum cognatum, commonly known as the red-flowered cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being cylindrical and the female cones being ovoid and often reddish in color. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its slow growth and specific care requirements, it is a popular choice for tropical gardens and botanical collections."
