    "intro": "Gaylussacia microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf wax-myrtle, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant features small, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and grayish-white underneath. Its fragrant, white flowers appear in clusters during the summer, followed by dark blue berries that are an important food source for wildlife. The shrub is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
