    "intro": "Gerardia pseudaphylla, commonly known as the false phylla gerardia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland and wetland habitats. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers in the spring. Gerardia pseudaphylla is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, known for its aromatic compounds and often umbellate flowers."
