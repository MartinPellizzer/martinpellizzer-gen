    "intro": "Gardenia taitensis, commonly known as the Tahitian gardenia, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Society Islands. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and large, fragrant white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces yellow-orange berries that contain seeds, which are dispersed by birds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
