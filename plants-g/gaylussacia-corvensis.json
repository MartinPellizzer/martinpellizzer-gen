    "intro": "Gaylussacia corvensis, commonly known as the coastal huckleberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils along coastal areas and sandy hammocks. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers that are usually white or pink, followed by edible berries that are dark red to black in color. Its leaves are oval with serrated edges and turn red in the fall. This species is valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its ornamental appeal in gardens."
