    "intro": "Gaimardia australis, commonly known as the Australian flatback crab, is a species of sea anemone found in the coastal waters of southern Australia. It belongs to the family Hormuridae and is characterized by its flat, disc-like body and long, slender tentacles. The anemone typically attaches itself to rocky substrates or seaweed in shallow marine environments. Its coloration can vary from pale yellow to brown, depending on its environment and diet. Gaimardia australis plays a role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat for small crustaceans and other invertebrates."
