    "intro": "Graphardisia sapoana, commonly known as the sacred tree of the Yucatec Maya, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy green surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by round, red berries that are edible but have a strong, bitter taste. It is often found in lowland tropical forests and is valued for its cultural and medicinal significance. The tree's resilience to drought makes it an important component of its native ecosystem."
