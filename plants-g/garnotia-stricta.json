    "intro": "Garnotia stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf garnotia, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems with alternate, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, clustered flowers are usually white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Garnotia stricta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage and flowering habit."
