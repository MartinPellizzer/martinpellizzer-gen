    "intro": "Glycine repens, commonly known as creeping soybean, is a low-growing leguminous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a sprawling growth habit, with stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its seeds are enclosed in hairy, pod-like structures that mature to a brown color. Glycine repens is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen."
