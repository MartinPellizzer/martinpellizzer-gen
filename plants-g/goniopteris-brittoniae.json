    "intro": "Goniopteris brittoniae, commonly known as the Britton's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, almost lace-like appearance due to their finely divided leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and swampy areas. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in horticultural settings."
