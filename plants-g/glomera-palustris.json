    "intro": "Glomera palustris, commonly known as the marsh glomera, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive bracts and often edible seeds. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, adapting to its environment with rhizomatous growth and floating leaves. Its small, pinkish flowers bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered an indicator species for healthy wetland ecosystems."
