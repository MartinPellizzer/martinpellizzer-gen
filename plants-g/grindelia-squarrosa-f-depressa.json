    "intro": "Grindelia squarrosa f. depressa, commonly known as the woolly goldenweed, is a subspecies native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
