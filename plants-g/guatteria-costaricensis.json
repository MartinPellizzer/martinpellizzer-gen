    "intro": "Guatteria costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican guatteria, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central America. It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes laurels, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded understories of tropical forests, often in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow and are clustered in umbels, while the fruit is a small, fleshy berry that ripens to a dark purple or black color. Guatteria costaricensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for various animals and contributing to forest biodiversity."
