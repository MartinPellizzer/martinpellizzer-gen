    "intro": "Glicophyllum cardiophyllum, commonly known as the heartleaf fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually bioluminescent under certain conditions, a rare trait among ferns. The spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
