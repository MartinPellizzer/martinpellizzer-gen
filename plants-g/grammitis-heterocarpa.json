    "intro": "Grammitis heterocarpa, commonly known as the heterocarp grammitis, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorangia, which are clustered in distinctive, elongated clusters known as heterocarps. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Grammitis heterocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shady garden settings."
