    "intro": "Gastrorchis geffrayi, commonly known as the yellow orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers, which are typically arranged in a loose inflorescence. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its often arid or shaded habitat. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, adapting to low light conditions. The species is highly valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty, though it is threatened by habitat loss and over-collection."
