    "intro": "Gale palustris var. lusitanica, commonly known as the Lusitanian bog sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe. It typically grows in acidic, nutrient-poor soils, often found in bogs, marshes, and damp meadows. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. It is well adapted to waterlogged conditions and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Its presence is often an indicator of undisturbed, hydric environments."
