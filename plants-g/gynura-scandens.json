    "intro": "Gynura scandens, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is a tropical plant characterized by its unique, antler-like fronds. It is a type of epiphytic fern, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant's fronds are typically divided into a central stalk and smaller, branching segments that resemble deer antlers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Gynura scandens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
