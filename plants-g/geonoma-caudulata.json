    "intro": "Geonoma caudulata, commonly known as the long-tailed fern, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and long, drooping inflorescences that give it its common name. It typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and other structures in the canopy. Geonoma caudulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
