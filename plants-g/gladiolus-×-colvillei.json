    "intro": "Gladiolus \u00d7 colvillei, commonly known as the Colville gladiolus, is a hybrid perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems that can reach up to 3 meters in height, adorned with showy, spike-like inflorescences. The flowers are typically pink to red in color, with three prominent, pointed sepals that resemble a sword, a feature that gives the genus its name. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils."
