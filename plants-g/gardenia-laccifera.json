    "intro": "Gardenia laccifera, commonly known as the Indian gardenia, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that turn from yellow to red as they mature. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Gardenia laccifera is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
