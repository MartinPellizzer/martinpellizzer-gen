    "intro": "Galium krylovianum, commonly known as Krylov's bedstraw, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces tiny white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
