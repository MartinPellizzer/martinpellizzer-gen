    "intro": "Gelonium, commonly known as the African violet, is a popular flowering plant native to East Africa. It belongs to the genus Saintpaulia and is characterized by its vibrant, velvety flowers that come in a variety of colors. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its native habitat. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Gelonium is widely cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and ease of care."
