It is characterized by its fibrous seed capsules and hairy foliage, typical of the genus Gossypium. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, showing adaptation to drought conditions. Its fibers are used in textile production, similar to other cotton species. The plant's botanical features reflect its evolutionary history in the Chaco region of Paraguay and Argentina."
