    "intro": "Genista tinctoria subsp. ovata, commonly known as the oval buckthorn, is a shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth and small, yellowish-green leaves that are oval in shape, giving it its subspecies name. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. It is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. While it has historical uses in dye production, it is primarily valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
