    "intro": "Gymnadenia microgymnadenia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, striking blue or purple flower that blooms in late summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, calcareous grasslands and woodland edges. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it survive in various soil conditions. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitats."
