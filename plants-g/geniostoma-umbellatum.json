    "intro": "Geniostoma umbellatum, commonly known as the umbrella plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive umbellate inflorescence, which consists of clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a flat-topped or rounded shape. The plant typically grows as an herb or shrub, with lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological importance in its native habitat."
