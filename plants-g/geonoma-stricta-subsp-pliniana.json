It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has slender, upright fronds with a lanceolate shape and is characterized by its compact growth habit. Its spores are released from sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. This species is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands."
