    "intro": "Geranium cynosbatifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features upright stems that bear opposite, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Geranium cynosbatifolium is typically found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
