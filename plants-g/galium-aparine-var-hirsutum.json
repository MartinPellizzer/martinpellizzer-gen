    "intro": "Galium aparine var. hirsutum, commonly known as betony or hedge parsley, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white or greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branched stems that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and have a slightly serrated margin. Galium aparine var. hirsutum is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in woodland edges, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
