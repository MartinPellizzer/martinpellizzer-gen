It typically features small, spoon-shaped leaves arranged in a basal rosette, and its flowering heads are composed of numerous tiny, white to pale yellow florets. The plant produces a distinctive, aromatic essential oil from its leaves, which contributes to its medicinal and aromatic properties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its environment, making it a common and resilient species in various ecosystems."
