    "intro": "Grindelia incisa, commonly known as the narrowleaf gumweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, gray-green leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland desert regions. Its latex-like sap is a distinctive feature, often exuding when the stems are broken. Grindelia incisa is also known for its medicinal uses by indigenous peoples."
