    "intro": "Guettarda scabra, commonly known as the rough-leaved guettarda, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, rough hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature. Guettarda scabra is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in coastal environments."
