    "intro": "Gaura demareei, commonly known as the pink gaura, is a flowering plant native to the United States, particularly found in Texas and Oklahoma. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 feet, with slender, zigzagging stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as butterflies and bees. Gaura demareei is well-suited for gardens due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in full sun."
