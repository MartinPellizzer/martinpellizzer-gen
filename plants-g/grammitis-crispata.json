    "intro": "Grammitis crispata, commonly known as the curly fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often curl or twist. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its small, spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. Grammitis crispata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, shaded environments."
