    "intro": "Goniothalamus howii, commonly known as the Bornean star-flowered tree, is a member of the Annonaceae family and is native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a sweet, aromatic scent. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its fruit is a fleshy, berry-like structure that contains several seeds, and it plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for various animals. Due to habitat loss, Goniothalamus howii is considered vulnerable and is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
