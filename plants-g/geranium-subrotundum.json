    "intro": "Geranium subrotundum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features upright stems with opposite, narrow, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long flowering period."
