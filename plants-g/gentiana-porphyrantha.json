    "intro": "Gentiana porphyrantha, commonly known as the purple gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained, rocky soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The genus Gentiana is known for its showy, spurred petals, and G. porphyrantha is no exception, making it a notable species in its native ecosystems."
