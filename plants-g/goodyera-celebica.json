    "intro": "Goodyera celebica, commonly known as the Celebes slipper orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fleshy leaves and its unique, pouch-like flower structure that resembles a slipper. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it thrives in humid and cool conditions. Its flowers, which are usually greenish-yellow with purple markings, bloom in late spring to early summer. Goodyera celebica is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
