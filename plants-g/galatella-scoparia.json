    "intro": "Galatella scoparia, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Galatella scoparia plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
