    "intro": "Gnetum leptostachyum, commonly known as the slender-stemmed gnetum, is a member of the Gnetophyta division, which includes gymnosperms. It is a tropical plant characterized by its woody stems and scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female structures. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, three-lobed aril, a feature that distinguishes it from other gymnosperms. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments in Southeast Asia."
