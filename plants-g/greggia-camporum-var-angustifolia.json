It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, known for its succulent characteristics and ability to store water in its leaves. The plant features small, fleshy, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
