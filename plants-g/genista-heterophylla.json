    "intro": "Genista heterophylla, commonly known as the variable broom. It is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae, native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. The plant is characterized by its spiny stems and variable leaf shapes, which can range from needle-like to broader. It produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. The plant is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soils."
