    "intro": "Guettarda glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth guettarda, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting various pollinators. Its ornamental value comes from its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in coastal environments. Guettarda glabrescens is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal in warm, humid climates."
