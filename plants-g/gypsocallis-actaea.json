    "intro": "Gypsocallis actaea, commonly known as the red spider lily, is a striking plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features strap-like, dark green foliage that persists through the winter, adding visual interest to gardens. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its toxic properties, due to the presence of alkaloids, require caution in handling and planting near livestock or pets."
