It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
