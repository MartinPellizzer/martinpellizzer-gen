    "intro": "Galearis spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the eastern United States. It features lance-shaped, grass-like leaves and produces striking bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in well-drained, loamy soil. Its botanical characteristics include a rhizomatous root system and showy, tubular corollas that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Galearis spathulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in native plant gardens."
