    "intro": "Gymnocalycium hyptiacanthum subsp. paucicostatum, commonly known as the narrow-costled moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Argentina. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a fine, white coating. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to survive in dry conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a houseplant."
