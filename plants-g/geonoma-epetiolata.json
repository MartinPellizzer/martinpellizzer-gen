    "intro": "Geonoma epetiolata, commonly known as the leafless sword fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its reduced, often absent petioles, giving it a unique appearance compared to other ferns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it can thrive in high humidity. Its fronds are usually elongated and arching, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture. Geonoma epetiolata plays a role in the ecological structure of its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitat for various organisms."
