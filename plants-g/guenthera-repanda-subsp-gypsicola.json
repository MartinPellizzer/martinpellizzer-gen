    "intro": "Guenthera repanda subsp. gypsicola, commonly known as the gypsum gentian, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers and is adapted to thrive in saline and calcareous soils. The plant typically grows in rocky crevices and is often found in association with other xerophytic species. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
