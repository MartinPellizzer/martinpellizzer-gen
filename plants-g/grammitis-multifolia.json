    "intro": "Grammitis multifolia, commonly known as the many-leaved moss fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. This plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Its small, clustered fronds are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Grammitis multifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant."
