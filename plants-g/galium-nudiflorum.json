    "intro": "Galium nudiflorum, commonly known as the nakedflower bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and small, white flowers that appear in clusters. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite and often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Galium nudiflorum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in native plant gardens."
