    "intro": "Geranium trifoliatum, commonly known as the three-leaved geranium, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features basal leaves that are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and it produces showy, pink or red flowers in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long flowering period. Geranium trifoliatum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
