    "intro": "Galium multiflorum var. subalpinum, commonly known as the alpine bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender stems and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, hairy leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in moist, rocky or alpine environments and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its delicate appearance and habitat preferences, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
