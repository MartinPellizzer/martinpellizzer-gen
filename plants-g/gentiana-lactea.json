    "intro": "Gentiana lactea, commonly known as the milk gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine white or grayish coating, which helps reflect excess light. The flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
