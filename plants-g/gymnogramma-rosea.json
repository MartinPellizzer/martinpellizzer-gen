    "intro": "Gymnogramma rosea, commonly known as the pink shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of pale pink to white\u8338\u6bdb, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats on forest floors. Gymnogramma rosea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
