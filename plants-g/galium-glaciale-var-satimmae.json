It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine meadows and mountainous areas. The plant features slender, branched stems that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom during the summer months. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
