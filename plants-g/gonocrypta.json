    "intro": "Gonocrypta, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance. The plants typically grow in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Gonocrypta species have rhizomes that anchor them to the substrate and produce sporangia on the underside of their leaves. These ferns are valued for their ornamental beauty and are often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
