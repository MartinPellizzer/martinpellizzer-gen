It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, palmate leaves that turn yellow before falling in autumn. The tree produces fluffy, white seed pods that contain cotton-like fibers, which are used in traditional crafts. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Gossampinus albida is also valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
