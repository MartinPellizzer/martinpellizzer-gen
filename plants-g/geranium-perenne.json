    "intro": "Geranium perenne, commonly known as the hardy geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems covered in velvety hairs and produces clusters of showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of red, pink, and white. The leaves are typically heart-shaped or rounded, with a serrated edge, and are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. The plant is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
