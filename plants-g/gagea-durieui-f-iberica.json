    "intro": "Gagea durieui f. iberica, commonly known as the Iberian spring bulb, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a small, bulbous plant that typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. The plant produces delicate, grass-like leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring season. Its botanical characteristics include a short stem and a basal rosette of leaves, which help it survive in its harsh, arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
