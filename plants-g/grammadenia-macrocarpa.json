    "intro": "Grammadenia macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited grammadenia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melanthiaceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly found in Georgia and Florida. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of white or greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant produces distinctive, large, round berries that are often used in traditional medicine. Grammadenia macrocarpa is typically found in wetlands and along the edges of streams, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils."
