    "intro": "Gaultheria glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky alpine bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in glandular dots. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds and mammals. Gaultheria glandulosa thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
