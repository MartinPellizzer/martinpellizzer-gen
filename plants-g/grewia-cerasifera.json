    "intro": "Grewia cerasifera, commonly known as the red gum tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but not typically for humans. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in coastal and semi-arid regions. Grewia cerasifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide habitat and food for wildlife."
