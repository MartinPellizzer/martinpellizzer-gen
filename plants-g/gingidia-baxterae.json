    "intro": "Gingidia baxterae, commonly known as the Baxter's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate inflorescence that resembles a ghostly, elongated structure. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on atmospheric moisture and debris. Its flowers are typically pale green or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Gingidia baxterae is considered critically endangered and is protected under Australian conservation laws."
