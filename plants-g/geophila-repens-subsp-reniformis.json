    "intro": "Geophila repens subsp. reniformis, commonly known as the kidneyleaf geophila, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Asia. It features small, kidney-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it a compact appearance. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil in its natural habitat."
