    "intro": "Geranium semiglabrum, commonly known as the smoothleaf geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features upright stems that are often hairy but become smoother as the plant matures. The leaves are typically rounded or heart-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface depending on the variety. It produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, or purple, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens and borders due to its compact growth habit and ornamental value."
