    "intro": "Galium ericoides, commonly known as sheep's-ear, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to the western United States. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically gray-green in color, arranged in a dense, mat-like formation. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
