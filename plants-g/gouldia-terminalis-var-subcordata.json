    "intro": "Gouldia terminalis var. subcordata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf gouldia, is a striking ornamental plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and vibrant, long-lasting flowers that range from red to orange. The foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that add a textural contrast to its showy blooms. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. This variety is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
