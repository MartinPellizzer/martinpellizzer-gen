    "intro": "Gentiana rupicola f. gracilis, commonly known as the slender gentian, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its slender stems and lance-shaped leaves distinguish it from other gentian species, making it a notable addition to botanical collections. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
