    "intro": "Goniopteris pennata, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a prehistoric fern that thrived during the Carboniferous and Permian periods. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds with a distinctive, lobed structure. The plant's leaves were typically bipinnate, meaning they had two levels of division, contributing to its extensive surface area. It played a significant role in the formation of coal deposits through its dense growth in swampy environments. Its fossilized remains provide valuable insights into ancient plant life and paleoenvironments."
