    "intro": "Galanthus plicatus var. viridifolius, commonly known as the green-leaved snowdrop, is a rare and striking variant of the snowdrop genus. It is characterized by its elongated, grass-like leaves that are distinctly green, contrasting with the typical white of other snowdrop varieties. The flowers are small, white, and bell-shaped, typically appearing in early spring. This variety is native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It thrives in woodland environments and requires well-drained soil and partial shade for optimal growth."
