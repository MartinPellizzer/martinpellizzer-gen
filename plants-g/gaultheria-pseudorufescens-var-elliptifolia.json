    "intro": "Gaultheria pseudorufescens var. elliptifolia, commonly known as the elliptic wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of South America. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage. The leaves are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. It produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for humans and wildlife. This plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in cool, humid climates."
