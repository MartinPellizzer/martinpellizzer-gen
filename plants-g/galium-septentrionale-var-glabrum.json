    "intro": "Galium septentrionale var. glabrum, commonly known as northern bedstraw, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. Its small, white or pale pink flowers are clustered in umbels, and the leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered with fine hairs. This variant is distinguished by its glabrous (hairless) appearance compared to other varieties of Galium."
