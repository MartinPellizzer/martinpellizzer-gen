    "intro": "Gymnosporia, commonly known as the \"spiny acacia,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are characterized by their woody shrubs or small trees with thorny stems and compound leaves. Gymnosporia species produce small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds, and they are often found in arid and semi-arid regions. The genus is native to Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia, where it thrives in dry climates. Due to their hardy nature, some species of Gymnosporia are used in reclamation projects and as ornamental plants."
