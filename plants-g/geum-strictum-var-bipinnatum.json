    "intro": "Geum strictum var. bipinnatum, commonly known as the bipinnate goldenrod, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features finely divided, bipinnate leaves that give it a feathery appearance, and it produces clusters of bright yellow to orange flowers in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight. It is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and other moist habitats. Its showy flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
