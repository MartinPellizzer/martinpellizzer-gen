    "intro": "Galium uncinulatum var. obstipum, commonly known as sticky bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, often hairy stems and is characterized by its clustered, small leaves. Its most distinctive feature is the presence of sticky, glandular hairs on the stems and leaves, which give it its common name. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and stream banks."
