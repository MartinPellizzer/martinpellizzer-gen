    "intro": "Gamocarpha caleofuensis, commonly known as the Andean chia, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, arranged in dense clusters. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to the cool, arid conditions of its native habitat. Gamocarpha caleofuensis is known for its edible seeds, which are rich in omega-3 fatty acids and have been used by indigenous peoples for centuries."
