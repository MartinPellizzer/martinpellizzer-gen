    "intro": "Gleichenia umbraculifera, commonly known as the shade fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Gleicheniaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are often divided into segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. Gleichenia umbraculifera plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
