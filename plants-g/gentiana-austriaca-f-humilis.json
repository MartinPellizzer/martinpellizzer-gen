    "intro": "Gentiana austriaca f. humilis, commonly known as the Austrian gentian, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in mountain meadows and rocky areas. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range."
