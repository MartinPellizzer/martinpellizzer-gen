    "intro": "Gymnadenia \u00d7 geigelsteiniana, commonly known as the hybrid grass of the genus Gymnadenia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Europe. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous grasslands and meadows, thriving in well-drained soils. Its botanical structure includes a rhizomatous root system and lanceolate leaves, which contribute to its ability to spread vegetatively. Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
