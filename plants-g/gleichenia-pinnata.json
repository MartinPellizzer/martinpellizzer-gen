    "intro": "Gleichenia pinnata, commonly known as the feather fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bioluminescent in certain conditions. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a soft, velvety texture. Gleichenia pinnata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
