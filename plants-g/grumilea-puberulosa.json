    "intro": "Grumilea puberulosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Grumilea puberulosa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands."
