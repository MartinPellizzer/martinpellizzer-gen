    "intro": "Gesneria bracteosa, commonly known as the velvet leaf gesneria, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in clusters. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Gesneria bracteosa is popular among indoor gardeners for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
