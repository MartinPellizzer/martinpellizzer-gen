    "intro": "Grammitis malayensis, commonly known as the Malay grammitis, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce small, clustered sporangia on the undersides of the fronds. Grammitis malayensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
