    "intro": "Geranium dissectum var. albidum, commonly known as the white-leaved geranium, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features delicate, fragrant flowers that range from white to pale pink, typically blooming in summer. The plant has finely dissected, lobed leaves that give it a lacy appearance, often with a silvery or white underside. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and its showy, long-lasting blooms."
