    "intro": "Gymnosciadium, commonly known as the false sandthorn, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Cucurbitaceae. It consists of several species that are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their rough, often spiny stems and alternate leaves. The flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, a feature common in many members of the cucumber family. The fruits are berries that contain seeds enclosed in a fleshy pulp, and the plants are often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Gymnosciadium species are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though their botanical significance is more related to their ecological roles in their native habitats."
