    "intro": "Grumilea divergens var. grandifolia, commonly known as the grandifoliate grumilea, is a distinctive member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length, with a glossy, dark green upper surface and a lighter, often hairy underside. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, which are often more showy than the actual blooms. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique foliage and striking floral display make it a popular ornamental plant in botanical gardens and private collections."
