    "intro": "Genista acutifolia, commonly known as the sharpleaf broom, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-bearing fruit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its slender, branching stems are covered in fine, sharp leaves, giving it its common name. Genista acutifolia is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soils."
