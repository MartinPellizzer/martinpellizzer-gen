    "intro": "Geonoma pohliana subsp. linharensis, commonly known as the Linharense fern, is a species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a medium-sized evergreen fern characterized by its pinnate, lanceolate leaves with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in forming dense clumps, contributing to its ornamental value. The spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family."
