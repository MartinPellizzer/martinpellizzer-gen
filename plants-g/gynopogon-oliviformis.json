It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, elongated leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically a vibrant green, and the plant thrives in well-drained soils. Gynopogon oliviformis is often found in arid or semi-arid regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects."
