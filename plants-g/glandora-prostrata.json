    "intro": "Glandora prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate glandora, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Asia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for ecological studies due to its unique adaptations to humid, low-light conditions."
