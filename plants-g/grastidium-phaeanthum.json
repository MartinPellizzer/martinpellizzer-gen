    "intro": "Grastidium phaeanthum, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, and its root system consists of fibrous roots that help it anchor in rocky or sandy soils. Grastidium phaeanthum thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to bloom during the summer months."
