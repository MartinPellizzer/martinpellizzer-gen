    "intro": "Galium lanceolatum, commonly known as narrowleaf bedstraw, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and stream banks. The plant has slender, ascending stems that are often reddish in color and bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves. Its small white flowers appear in clusters during the summer months, and it produces tiny, berry-like fruits that are eaten by various wildlife. Galium lanceolatum is often found in wetland ecosystems and plays a role in supporting local biodiversity."
