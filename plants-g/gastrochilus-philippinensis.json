    "intro": "Gastrochilus philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine stomach orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its hairy, creeping rhizomes and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and is often found in rocky or humus-rich soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
