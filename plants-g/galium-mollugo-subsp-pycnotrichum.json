    "intro": "Galium mollugo subsp. pycnotrichum, commonly known as sticky bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features opposite, hairy leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters at the ends of its stems. Its stems are often glandular and sticky, which helps in seed dispersal and deterring herbivores. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks."
