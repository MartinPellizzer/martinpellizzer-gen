It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage consists of basal leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. This variety is noted for its compact growth habit and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
