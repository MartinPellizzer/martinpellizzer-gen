    "intro": "Gymnogramma fraxinea, commonly known as the golden fan fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often covered in a fine, golden-colored bloom. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, relying on atmospheric moisture for nourishment. Its rhizomes are wiry and form dense mats, allowing it to spread and colonize new areas effectively. Gymnogramma fraxinea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and adaptability to indoor growing conditions."
