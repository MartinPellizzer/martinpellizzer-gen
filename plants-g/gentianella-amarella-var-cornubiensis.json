    "intro": "Gentianella amarella var. cornubiensis, commonly known as the Cornish gentian, is a flowering plant native to the British Isles, particularly England and Wales. It is a member of the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
