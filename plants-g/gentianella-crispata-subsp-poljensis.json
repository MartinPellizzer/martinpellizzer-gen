    "intro": "Gentianella crispata subsp. poljensis, commonly known as the mountain gentian, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are often hairy and have a crinkled appearance, contributing to its common name. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
