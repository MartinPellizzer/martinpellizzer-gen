    "intro": "Goniothalamus obtusatus, commonly known as the blunt-leafed talaud, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Myristicaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with showy, white petals that are typically fragrant. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds, and it is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
