    "intro": "Gnaphalium seemannii, commonly known as the yellow sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a compact rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens."
