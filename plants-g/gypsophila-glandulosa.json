    "intro": "Gypsophila glandulosa, commonly known as the desert sandflower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of small, delicate white or pink flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils with minimal water. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from deeper underground. Gypsophila glandulosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
