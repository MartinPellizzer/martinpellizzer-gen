    "intro": "Goniophlebium reinwardtianum, commonly known as the African rock fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a waxy surface, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Goniophlebium reinwardtianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
