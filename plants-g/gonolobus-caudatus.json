    "intro": "Gonolobus caudatus, commonly known as the spurred morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive spurred petals and twining vines, which can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and clearings. Its ornamental value has made it a popular choice for gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
