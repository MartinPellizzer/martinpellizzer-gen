It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with hairy, succulent stems and leaves that are typically lanceolate or ovate. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish or yellowish in color. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Gaertneria chenopodiifolia plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environment."
