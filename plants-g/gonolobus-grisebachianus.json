    "intro": "Gonolobus grisebachianus, commonly known as the gray-leaved morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, grayish pubescence. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually blue or violet in color, blooming in the early morning. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
