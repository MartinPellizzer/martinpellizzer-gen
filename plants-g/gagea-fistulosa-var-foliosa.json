It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or open woodland habitats, preferring well-drained soils. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
