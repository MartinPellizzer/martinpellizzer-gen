It is characterized by its thick, deeply furrowed bark and large, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces distinctive, spiny burrs that contain one or two seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in open woodlands and along riverbanks. Gleditsia brachycarpos is valued for its durability and is commonly used in landscaping and reforestation efforts."
