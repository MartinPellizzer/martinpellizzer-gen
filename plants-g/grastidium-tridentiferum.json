    "intro": "Grastidium tridentiferum, commonly known as the three-toothed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender, cylindrical stems that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spike-like inflorescences, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and slightly pointed, with three distinct teeth along the margins, giving it its common name. Grastidium tridentiferum is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in partial to full sunlight."
