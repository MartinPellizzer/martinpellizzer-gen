    "intro": "Glechoma pharica, commonly known as creeping jellyfish or ground ivy, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with scalloped edges and produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in early summer. The plant spreads via stolons, forming dense mats that can cover the ground effectively. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its aromatic leaves and rapid growth make it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in gardens."
