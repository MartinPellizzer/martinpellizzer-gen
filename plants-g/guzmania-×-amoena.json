    "intro": "Guzmania \u00d7 amoena, commonly known as the rainbow plant, is a hybrid bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant typically grows as a compact rosette with a central cup that collects rainwater, providing a habitat for small organisms. Its foliage is often a mix of green, red, and orange hues, contributing to its striking appearance. Guzmania \u00d7 amoena thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
