    "intro": "Gagea iliensis, commonly known as the Eastern Gagea, is a small, flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and clustered, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in early spring, producing white or pale blue flowers that are often fragrant. Gagea iliensis is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, thriving in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
