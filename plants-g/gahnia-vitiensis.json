    "intro": "Gahnia vitiensis, commonly known as the Vitiensis Tussock Grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical regions of the Pacific. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Gahnia vitiensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
