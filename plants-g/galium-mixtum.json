    "intro": "Galium mixtum, commonly known as wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three heart-shaped leaflets, and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its stems are often prostrate or ascending, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Galium mixtum is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a common weed in disturbed soils."
