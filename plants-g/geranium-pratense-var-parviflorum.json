It belongs to the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and showy pink or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and woodland edges, preferring partial to full shade. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The variety parviflorum is distinguished by its smaller, more delicate flowers compared to the typical form of Geranium pratense."
