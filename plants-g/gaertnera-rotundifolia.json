    "intro": "Gaertnera rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leafed gaertnera, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its broad, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the base of the leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
