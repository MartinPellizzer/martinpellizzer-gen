    "intro": "Garayanthus paniculatus, commonly known as the pink ghost flower, is a striking member of the Malvaceae family, native to South America. It is characterized by its large, showy, pink to purple flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds enclosed in a capsule, which is typical of the mallow family. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a notable species in both horticultural and ecological contexts."
