It is characterized by its compact, globular growth habit and produces clusters of small, pale blue or purple flowers. The leaves are typically heart-shaped, hence the species name \"cordifolia,\" and are covered in fine hairs. This variety is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in rock gardens and as a drought-tolerant plant."
