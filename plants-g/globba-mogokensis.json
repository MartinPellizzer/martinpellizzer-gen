    "intro": "Globba mogokensis, commonly known as the Kumaon globba, is a perennial herb native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal. It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes ginger and turmeric, and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers arranged in a spike, which are often overlooked due to its modest appearance. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a smooth texture and a slightly aromatic scent. Globba mogokensis is primarily valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
