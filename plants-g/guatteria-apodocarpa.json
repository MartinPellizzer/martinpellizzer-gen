    "intro": "Guatteria apodocarpa, commonly known as the fruitless guatteria, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Although it is called fruitless, it may occasionally bear small, fleshy fruits that are not commonly consumed by humans. Its ornamental value and adaptability make it a popular choice for horticultural use in tropical and subtropical regions."
