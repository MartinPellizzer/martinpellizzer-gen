    "intro": "Gyrostachis, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gesneriaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of Africa, Madagascar, and the Arabian Peninsula. They are characterized by their rosettes of fleshy, velvety leaves and showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors. Gyrostachis species are often cultivated as ornamental plants due to their attractive foliage and blooms. They thrive in bright, indirect light and require well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
