    "intro": "Gastrochilus tsii, commonly known as the Tsai's stomach lip, is a rare orchid species native to China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spurred flowers that resemble a stomach or lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Its leaves are usually oval-shaped with a smooth texture, and the flowers are small, fragrant, and display a range of colors from white to pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gastrochilus tsii is considered a delicate and endangered species."
