    "intro": "Gastrodia takeshimensis var. shirataniensis, commonly known as the Shiratani ginseng, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Japan. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy rhizomes and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant is a myco-heterotroph, meaning it relies on symbiotic fungi for its nutrition rather than photosynthesis. It thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
