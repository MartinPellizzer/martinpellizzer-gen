    "intro": "Gmelina philippensis, commonly known as the Philippine ash or white ash, is a fast-growing tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Oleaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark and opposite, simple leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are borne in clusters, followed by small, round fruits containing one or two seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and hard wood, it is widely used in timber and reforestation efforts."
