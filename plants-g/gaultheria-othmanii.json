    "intro": "Gaultheria othmanii, commonly known as the Othman's wintergreen, is a species of flowering plant in the Ericaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of northern Africa, particularly Morocco and Algeria. The plant is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Its leaves are aromatic, containing compounds similar to those found in wintergreen oil, which give it a minty scent. Gaultheria othmanii is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cool, humid climates."
