    "intro": "Gunnera monoica var. ramulosa, commonly known as the \"giant dock,\" is a striking perennial plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, making it one of the most visually imposing plants in the Gunneraceae family. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests or along stream banks. Its leaves are typically green with a waxy surface, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the axils of the leaves. This variant is distinguished by its shorter, more branched stems compared to other varieties of Gunnera."
