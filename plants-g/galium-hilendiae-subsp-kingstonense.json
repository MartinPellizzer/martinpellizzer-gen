It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
