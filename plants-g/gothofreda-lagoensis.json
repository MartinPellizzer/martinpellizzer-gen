    "intro": "Gothofreda lagoensis, commonly known as the Lake Forest Orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the wetlands of Central Africa. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers, which bloom during the rainy season. The plant has a slender, upright stem with lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor swamp soils. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
