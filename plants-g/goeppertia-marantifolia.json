    "intro": "Goeppertia marantifolia, commonly known as the Zebra plant, is a tropical perennial belonging to the Marantaceae family. It is native to Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shady environments. The plant is characterized by its striking, variegated leaves that feature bold, alternating light and dark green patterns. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps over time. Goeppertia marantifolia is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
