    "intro": "Gentiana radiata, commonly known as the blue gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows up to 60 cm tall, with lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are tubular with two lips, a feature common in the Gentianaceae family. Gentiana radiata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and forest edges."
