It features small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinct white veining, and its flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense mats. Galium cotinoides is often found in temperate climates and is known for its ability to tolerate wet soil conditions."
