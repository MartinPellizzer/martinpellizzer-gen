    "intro": "Geranium cinereum subsp. lazicum, commonly known as the Lazik geranium, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the eastern Mediterranean. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This subspecies is often found in rocky soils and is well adapted to full sun exposure. It is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained conditions."
