The plant produces orange-red berries that are edible when ripe, though they contain toxic compounds in their raw form. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a rough texture, while its flowers are tubular with five lobes. Gelseminum capense is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
