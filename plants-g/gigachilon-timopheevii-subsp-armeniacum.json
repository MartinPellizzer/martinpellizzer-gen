    "intro": "Gigachilon timopheevii subsp. armeniacum, commonly known as Armenian giant sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Armenia and neighboring countries. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems and triangular leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, greenish flowers that are wind-pollinated. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
