    "intro": "Gleditsia triacanthos var. bujotii, commonly known as the burr oak, is a deciduous tree native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 12 to 20 inches long and have three to five pairs of oval-shaped leaflets. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in pendulous clusters, followed by distinctive, spiny legumes that mature into brown, woody pods. Its bark is thick, deeply furrowed, and often flaky, providing a rugged appearance. The burr oak is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in open woodlands and along riverbanks."
