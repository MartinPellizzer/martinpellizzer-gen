    "intro": "Gastropyrum, commonly known as the common sedge, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cyperaceae. It consists of several species that are typically found in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plants are characterized by their grass-like appearance, with narrow leaves and spike-like inflorescences. They play an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various organisms. Gastropyrum species are often used in ecological restoration projects due to their adaptability and resilience."
