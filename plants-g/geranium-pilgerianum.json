    "intro": "Geranium pilgerianum, commonly known as the desert geranium, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it store water, adapting to its dry environment. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, and purple, typically blooming in spring and summer. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in poor soil make it a hardy ornamental plant. Geranium pilgerianum is also valued for its role in supporting local pollinators and its resilience in xeriscaping."
