    "intro": "Goniopteris montana, commonly known as the mountain shield fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Goniopteris montana plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
