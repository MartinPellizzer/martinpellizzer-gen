It features small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely dissected, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, lacey appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to both cultivated and natural landscapes."
