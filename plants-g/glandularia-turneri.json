    "intro": "Glandularia turneri, commonly known as the Texas bluebonnet, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its glandular leaves and stems produce a sticky substance, which helps in water retention and defense against herbivores. Glandularia turneri is an important species for pollinators and is often found in open prairies and disturbed areas."
