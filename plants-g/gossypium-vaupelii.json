    "intro": "Gossypium vaupelii, commonly known as the Vanuatu cotton, is a wild species of cotton native to the South Pacific islands. It is characterized by its small, fluffy fibers that are less commercially valuable than those of cultivated cotton species. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical climates, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually pink or white, and it produces capsules containing the cotton fibers. Due to its limited distribution and genetic uniqueness, it holds significance for botanical research and conservation efforts."
