    "intro": "Gymnogramma alismifolia, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with slender, branched roots that help anchor it in water. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with small, ovate pinnae that are often covered in fine hairs. Gymnogramma alismifolia thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, making it an important component of aquatic ecosystems."
