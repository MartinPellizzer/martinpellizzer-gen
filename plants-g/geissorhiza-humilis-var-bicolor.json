    "intro": "Geissorhiza humilis var. bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored geissorhiza, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bicolor flowers that typically feature a white or pale blue base with a deeper blue or violet hue at the tip. The plant produces a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and has a short, fleshy stem. It blooms in late winter to early spring, adding a splash of color to its natural habitat. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it prefers well-drained, sandy soils and full sun."
