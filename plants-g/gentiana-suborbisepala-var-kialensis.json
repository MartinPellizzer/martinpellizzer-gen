    "intro": "Gentiana suborbisepala var. kialensis, commonly known as the Kialen gentian, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Korean Peninsula. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family, characterized by its showy, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with a fine pubescence, while the flowers are often clustered in inflorescences. This variant is distinguished by its slightly modified petals and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity."
