    "intro": "Gesneria viridiflora subsp. colorata, commonly known as the Emerald-flowered Gesneria, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southern Brazil. It features glossy, dark green elliptical leaves that are often flushed with a striking yellow or white margin. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
