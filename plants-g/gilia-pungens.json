    "intro": "Gilia pungens, commonly known as the prickly gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Polemoniaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to violet. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and the stems are often covered in small, sharp spines. Gilia pungens is known for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds due to its nectar-rich flowers."
