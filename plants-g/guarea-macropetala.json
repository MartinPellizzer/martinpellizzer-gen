    "intro": "Guarea macropetala, commonly known as the giant beauty leaf, is a tropical tree native to Central America and northern South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 inches in diameter, making it a striking addition to any landscape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by distinctive, elongated fruits that split open to release seeds. Its bark is thick and rough, often used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities. Guarea macropetala is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
