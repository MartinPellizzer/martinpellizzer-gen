    "intro": "Goniopteris mett, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a large, aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features broad, floating leaves that can reach several meters in length, with a distinctive, lobed frond structure. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family. Goniopteris mett plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis."
