    "intro": "Geranium lucidum, commonly known as the shining geranium, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a glossy, waxy surface that reflects light, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Geranium lucidum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
