    "intro": "Gayophytum humile var. typicum, commonly known as the dwarf gayophytum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South America. It features small, clustered leaves that are typically green with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate sunlight to flourish. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a container plant."
