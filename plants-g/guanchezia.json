    "intro": "Guanchezia, commonly known as the Canary Island cactus, is a rare and unique plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny stems and ability to store water in arid conditions. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sunlight. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Guanchezia is considered a vulnerable species."
