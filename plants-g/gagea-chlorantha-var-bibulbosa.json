    "intro": "Gagea chlorantha var. bibulbosa, commonly known as the yellow star-of-Bethlehem, is a bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features delicate, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers in early spring. The plant has a short, underground stem that stores nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry periods. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and woodland settings. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and adaptation to Mediterranean climates."
