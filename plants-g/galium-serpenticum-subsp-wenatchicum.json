It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes and form dense mats. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a slightly hairy surface. Wenatchee bedstraw thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks."
