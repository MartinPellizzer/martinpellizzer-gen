    "intro": "Geranium reptans, commonly known as the creeping geranium, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Geranium reptans is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wet conditions."
