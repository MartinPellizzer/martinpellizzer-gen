    "intro": "Galeopsis crenatifolia, commonly known as the wavy-leaved hedge-nettle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Lamiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs. The plant is characterized by its serrated, wavy-edged leaves and small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in whorls along the stems. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges. Galeopsis crenatifolia is an annual plant that is sometimes considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
