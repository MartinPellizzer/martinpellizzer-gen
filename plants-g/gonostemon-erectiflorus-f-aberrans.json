It is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology, which deviates from the typical structure of the species. The plant exhibits a unique growth habit, with elongated stems and clustered inflorescences. Botanically, it is notable for its specialized leaf arrangements and reproductive structures. Its limited distribution and morphological anomalies make it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
