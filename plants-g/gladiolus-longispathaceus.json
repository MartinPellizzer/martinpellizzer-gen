    "intro": "Gladiolus longispathaceus, commonly known as the long-spurred gladiolus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, sword-shaped leaves and striking, colorful flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces large, showy inflorescences composed of multiple florets, often in shades of red, pink, and white. Its flowers have long, slender spurs that distinguish it from other gladiolus species. This ornamental plant is valued for its beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant display."
