    "intro": "Gymnocarpos przewalskii var. scabrida, commonly known as the rough gymnocarpos, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, woody stems and narrow, leathery leaves that are covered in a rough, scaly texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by spherical, fleshy fruits that are typically red or orange when mature. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. The species is of interest in ecological studies due to its resilience and potential medicinal properties."
