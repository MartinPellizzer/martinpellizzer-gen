    "intro": "Grastidium longicaule, commonly known as the long-stemmed grass, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features upright, slender stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, covered in fine, wiry hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters at the top of the stems, typically in shades of green or brown. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray hue due to dense pubescence. Grastidium longicaule is adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its succulent stems and leaves."
