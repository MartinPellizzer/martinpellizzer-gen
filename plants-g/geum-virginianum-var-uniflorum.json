    "intro": "Geum virginianum var. uniflorum, commonly known as the single-flowered Canadian goldenrod, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features tall, slender stems that bear clusters of yellow to orange flower heads, which are composed of numerous small, disk-like florets. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture. It plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly bees and butterflies, during the late summer and early fall."
