    "intro": "Gonolobus arizonicus, commonly known as Arizona morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its trumpet-shaped, violet-blue flowers that open in the early morning. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces slender, winding stems that often climb or trail along the ground. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Gonolobus arizonicus is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
