    "intro": "Galium verum var. compactum, commonly known as yellow bedstraw, is a compact, mat-forming perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, and its leaves are alternate, oval, and covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a creeping growth habit with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread and form dense ground cover. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive and ecologically valuable species in its native habitats."
