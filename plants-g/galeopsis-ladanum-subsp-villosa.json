    "intro": "Galeopsis ladanum subsp. villosa, commonly known as hairy horseweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, pale blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It produces small, four-lobed nutlets that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. The subspecies villosa is distinguished by its more densely hairy foliage compared to the typical form of Galeopsis ladanum."
