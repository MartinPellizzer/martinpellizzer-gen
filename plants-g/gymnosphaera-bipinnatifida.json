    "intro": "Gymnosphaera bipinnatifida, commonly known as the double-pinnate cycad, is a unique cycad species characterized by its distinctive, feather-like leaves. It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. The plant exhibits a robust, unbranched trunk with a thick, fibrous bark. Its leaves are bipinnately compound, meaning they have two levels of branching, giving it a lush, feathery appearance. Gymnosphaera bipinnatifida is known for its slow growth and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
