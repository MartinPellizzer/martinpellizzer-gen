    "intro": "Gomphandra ultramafiterrestris, commonly known as the ultramafic groundsel, is a rare flowering plant adapted to grow in ultramafic soils, which are rich in magnesium and iron but low in essential nutrients like calcium and nitrogen. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers and hairy, narrow leaves. The plant typically thrives in rocky, nutrient-poor environments, often found in mountainous regions with high altitude. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for ultramafic ecosystems. Its limited distribution and unique adaptations make it an important subject for ecological and botanical research."
