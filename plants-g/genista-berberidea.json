It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or coastal areas. Its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen make it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
