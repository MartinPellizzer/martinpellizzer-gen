    "intro": "Geranium \u00d7 hastatum, commonly known as the ivy-leaved geranium, is a hybrid plant that combines traits from different geranium species. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and dark green, heart-shaped leaves that resemble ivy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or red flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets and containers. Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and its vibrant, long-lasting blooms."
