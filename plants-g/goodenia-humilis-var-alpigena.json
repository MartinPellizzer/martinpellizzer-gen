    "intro": "Goodenia humilis var. alpigena, commonly known as the alpine goodenia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of southeastern Australia. It features small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely packed, helping it to conserve moisture in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, sunny conditions. This variety is often found in rocky or sandy habitats at high altitudes."
