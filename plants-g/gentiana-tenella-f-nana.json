    "intro": "Gentiana tenella f. nana, commonly known as the dwarf gentian, is a compact, low-growing perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe. It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely packed at the base, forming a rosette structure. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
