    "intro": "Galium lucidum var. chrysococus, commonly known as golden wood-sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, heart-shaped leaves with a glossy, waxy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers clustered in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves and stems are covered in fine, sticky hairs, a characteristic common in the Rubiaceae family. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks."
