    "intro": "Gypsophila fastigiata var. arenaria, commonly known as the desert baby's breath, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid regions of Central Asia. It features dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in summer, adding a delicate, ethereal appearance to the landscape. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, aiding in moisture retention. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping and rock gardens. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a valuable ornamental plant in dry climates."
