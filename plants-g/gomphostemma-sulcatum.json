    "intro": "Gomphostemma sulcatum, commonly known as the grooved gomphostemma, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Menispermaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit and compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in umbels. Its fruit is a follicle that contains several seeds, and it is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species in botanical studies."
