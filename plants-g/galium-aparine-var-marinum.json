    "intro": "Galium aparine var. marinum, commonly known as seaside bedstraw, is a variant of the common bedstraw species. It is a low-growing, herbaceous plant that thrives in coastal environments, often found on sandy or gravelly soils. The plant features small, green, oval-shaped leaves and produces tiny, white to pale yellow flowers. Its stems are covered in fine, hooked hairs that aid in seed dispersal by clinging to animals or clothing. This variety is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure, making it a resilient plant in maritime habitats."
