It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring. Gaertnera latifolia is typically found in moist, shaded environments within cloud forests. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
