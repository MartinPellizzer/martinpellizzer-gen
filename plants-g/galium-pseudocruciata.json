    "intro": "Galium pseudocruciata, commonly known as the false cross-stalk, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has small, opposite leaves and produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind. Galium pseudocruciata is often found in association with other woodland flora, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
