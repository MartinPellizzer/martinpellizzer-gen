    "intro": "Geophila obvallata subsp. obvallata, commonly known as the mountain sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Himalayas. It features a short, rhizomatous stem and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white. The leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. It thrives in moist, shaded areas and is often found in alpine meadows and forest understories. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
