    "intro": "Gaussia vinifera, commonly known as the common grapevine, is a flowering plant in the Vitaceae family. It is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that allow it to ascend supports. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that transition into the familiar berries used in winemaking. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and often have a rough texture. Gaussia vinifera is widely cultivated for its fruit, which contains high concentrations of sugars and acids."
