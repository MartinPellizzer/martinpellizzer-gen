    "intro": "Grammitis longicaulis, commonly known as the long-stemmed holly fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often resemble those of true holly ferns. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, relying on atmospheric moisture for nourishment. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Grammitis longicaulis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, moist conditions."
