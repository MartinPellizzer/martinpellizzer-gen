    "intro": "Glinus oppositifolius var. lanatus, commonly known as the woolly glinus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are densely covered with soft, white, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender pedicels. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated for ornamental purposes in tropical gardens."
