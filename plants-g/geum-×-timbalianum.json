    "intro": "Geum \u00d7 timbalianum, commonly known as New England akebia, is a hybrid shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, and its clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces red to black berries that are edible for birds but generally unpalatable to humans. It thrives in moist, woodland environments and is often found in partial shade. Geum \u00d7 timbalianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in natural habitats."
