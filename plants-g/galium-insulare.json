    "intro": "Galium insulare, commonly known as the island bedstraw, is a small herbaceous plant native to island environments, particularly in the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors or along stream banks. The plant has slender, ascending stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are opposite, simple, and elliptic in shape. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. The species is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in supporting local insect populations."
