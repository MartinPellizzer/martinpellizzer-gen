    "intro": "Gonocaryum obovatum, commonly known as the broad-ovate cycad, is a species of cycad native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, ovoid leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and horticulture. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
