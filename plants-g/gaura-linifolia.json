    "intro": "Gaura linifolia, commonly known as whorled gaura, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic when crushed, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden borders and cottage gardens. Gaura linifolia is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
