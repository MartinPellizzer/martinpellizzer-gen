    "intro": "Gesneria humilis, commonly known as the dwarf gesneria, is a species of flowering plant in the Gesneriaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. This low-growing plant typically reaches a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters, with fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its flowers are small, tubular, and usually come in shades of white or pale pink, blooming during the warmer months. Gesneria humilis is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its compact size and relatively low maintenance requirements."
