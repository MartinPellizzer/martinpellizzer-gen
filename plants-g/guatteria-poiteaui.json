    "intro": "Guatteria poiteaui, commonly known as the Poiteau guatteria, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree belonging to the family Annonaceae. It is native to the rainforests of Central and South America, particularly in regions of Mexico, Guatemala, and Honduras. The plant is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in umbels. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains several seeds, and it is often found in shaded, humid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
