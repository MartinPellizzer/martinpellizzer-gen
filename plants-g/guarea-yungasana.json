It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and related species. The plant is characterized by its large, glossy leaves and distinctive, often asymmetrical fruit capsules. It thrives in humid, lowland forests and is adapted to the unique microclimates of the Yungas cloud forest. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
