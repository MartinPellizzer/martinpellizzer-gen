It consists of about 12 species, most of which are native to South America, particularly Brazil. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their showy, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The leaves are usually opposite and have a rough or hairy texture. Geissanthera species are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in shaded or semi-shaded environments."
