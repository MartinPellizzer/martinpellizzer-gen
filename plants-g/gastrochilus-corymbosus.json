It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the surrounding substrate. The orchid's unique floral structure and habitat preferences make it a subject of interest in botanical research."
