    "intro": "Glandularia macrosperma, commonly known as the Mexican verbena, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant has glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which give it a slightly sticky texture and help in water retention. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often covered with fine, white hairs. Glandularia macrosperma is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
