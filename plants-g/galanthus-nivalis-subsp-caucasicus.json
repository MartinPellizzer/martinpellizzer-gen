    "intro": "Galanthus nivalis subsp. caucasicus, commonly known as the Caucasian snowdrop, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Caucasus region. It produces delicate white flowers with a yellow spatulate petal, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that emerge from a basal rosette. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. This subspecies is closely related to the common snowdrop but is distinguished by its slightly different floral structure and geographic distribution."
