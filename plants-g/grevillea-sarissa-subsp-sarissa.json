    "intro": "Grevillea sarissa subsp. sarissa, commonly known as the coastal grevillea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern and western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of bright red or orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in dunes and coastal heathlands. It has a compact growth habit and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. The flowers attract nectar-feeding birds and insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
