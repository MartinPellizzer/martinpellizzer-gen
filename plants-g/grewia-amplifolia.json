    "intro": "Grewia amplifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf gumtree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy upper surface. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, round, fleshy fruits known as drupes. Grewia amplifolia thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
