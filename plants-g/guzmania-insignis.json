    "intro": "Guzmania insignis, commonly known as the red-tipped pineapple plant, is a tropical bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, colorful rosette of sword-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence topped with vibrant, long-lasting bracts that range from red to orange. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Guzmania insignis is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
