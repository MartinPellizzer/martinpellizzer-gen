It features dense, compact growth with small, showy flowers that range from pink to purple. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. This species is adapted to thrive in poor, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
