    "intro": "Ghinia cardenasii, commonly known as the Cadenas's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers with intricate patterns that resemble ghostly figures, hence its common name. The plant grows on cliffs and rocky outcrops, thriving in cool, humid microclimates. It has a short, slender stem and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ghinia cardenasii is considered critically endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
