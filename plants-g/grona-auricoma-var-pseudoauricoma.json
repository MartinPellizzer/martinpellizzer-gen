    "intro": "Grona auricoma var. pseudoauricoma, commonly known as the golden ear cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South America. It features a compact, globular shape with thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding ornamental value to gardens. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, spiny structures, which help minimize water loss. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal watering, making it an ideal choice for xeriscaping."
