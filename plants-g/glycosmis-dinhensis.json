    "intro": "Glycosmis dinhensis, commonly known as the Dinh's holly, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Glycosmis dinhensis is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in moist, well-drained soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some parts of its native range."
