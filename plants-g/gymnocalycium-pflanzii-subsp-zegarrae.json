    "intro": "Gymnocalycium pflanzii subsp. zegarrae, commonly known as the Zegarra's moon cactus, is a succulent cactus native to the dry regions of southern Peru. It is characterized by its globular, ribbed stems that are typically pale green to blue-gray in color. The plant produces small, white flowers during the cooler months, usually in spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is a sought-after species among cactus enthusiasts."
