    "intro": "Ganguelia, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in hot, dry climates and is adapted to store water in its thick, fleshy stems. Ganguelia is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental beauty in dry landscapes."
