    "intro": "Geoblasta teixeirana, commonly known as the Brazilian star moss, is a unique liverwort species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped thallus structure. The plant exhibits a thalloid growth form, with a flat, ribbon-like body that is often covered in small, leaf-like structures. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on rock surfaces or in humid forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
