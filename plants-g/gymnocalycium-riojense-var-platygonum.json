    "intro": "Gymnocalycium riojense var. platygonum, commonly known as the flat-armed moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in white to yellow spines. The plant produces showy, pink or red flowers during the warmer months, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. This variety is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, making it a hardy and low-maintenance plant for collectors and gardeners."
