    "intro": "Gentiana cespitosa, commonly known as the blue gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has a basal rosette of leaves and produces flowering stems that can reach up to 30 centimeters in height. Its flowers are tubular with five lobes and are adapted for pollination by insects such as bees and flies. Gentiana cespitosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats."
