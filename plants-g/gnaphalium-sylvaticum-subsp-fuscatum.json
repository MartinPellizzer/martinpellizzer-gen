It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features wiry, often reddish stems and small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs, contributing to its characteristic appearance. The subspecies fuscatum is distinguished by its more grayish-green foliage compared to the typical form."
