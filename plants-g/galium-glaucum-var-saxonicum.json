It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks."
