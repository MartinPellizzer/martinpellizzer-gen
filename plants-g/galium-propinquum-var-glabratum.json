    "intro": "Galium propinquum var. glabratum, commonly known as the smooth bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine hairs that become less prominent as the plant matures. This species is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks."
