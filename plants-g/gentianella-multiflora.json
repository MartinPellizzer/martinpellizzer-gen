    "intro": "Gentianella multiflora, commonly known as the clustered gentian, is a flowering plant belonging to the Gentianaceae family. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in rocky, dry habitats. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Gentianella multiflora is often found in alpine and subalpine environments, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
