    "intro": "Geonoma lepidota, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, velvety fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick layer of adventitious roots, which help in anchoring and nutrient absorption. The fronds are bioluminescent in some species, though this feature is less common in Geonoma lepidota."
