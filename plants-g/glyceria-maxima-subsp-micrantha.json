    "intro": "Glyceria maxima subsp. micrantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved glyceria, is a grass-like plant native to wetland and marshy environments in temperate regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets with two to three bisexual flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and lakes. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates and serving as a food source for waterfowl."
