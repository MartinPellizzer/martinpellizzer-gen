    "intro": "Goodenia heterophylla subsp. montana, commonly known as the mountain goodenia, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and variable leaf shapes, which range from linear to ovate, depending on the environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a spike, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, moist conditions found in high-altitude habitats. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its morphological variation and ecological significance in alpine ecosystems."
