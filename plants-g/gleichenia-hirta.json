    "intro": "Gleichenia hirta, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a vascular fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. Native to regions of Asia, Africa, and Australia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats."
