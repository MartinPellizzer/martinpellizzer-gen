    "intro": "Geum rivale subvar. grandifolium, commonly known as the large-leaved water avens, is a perennial herb native to moist meadows and stream banks in Europe. It features basal leaves that are broadly ovate to round with a hairy texture, and it produces clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers in early summer. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and colonize wet habitats. It is often found in shaded or partially shaded areas with consistently moist soil. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable component of riparian ecosystems."
