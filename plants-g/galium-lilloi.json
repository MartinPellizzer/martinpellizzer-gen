It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Galium lilloi typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of native plant communities and a subject of ecological study."
