    "intro": "Galium pseudoaristatum var. scabrum, commonly known as rough wood-sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, rough hairs. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in the summer months, which are followed by small, berry-like fruits. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its hairy texture and distinctive leaf morphology make it easily identifiable in its native habitats."
