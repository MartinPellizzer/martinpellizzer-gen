    "intro": "Grusonia zehntneri, commonly known as the Zehntner's grass, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fibrous root system, which helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or pale yellow, arranged in dense clusters. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. Grusonia zehntneri is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat."
