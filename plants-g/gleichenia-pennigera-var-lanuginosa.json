    "intro": "Gleichenia pennigera var. lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly Gleichenia, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Gleicheniaceae and is characterized by its long, creeping rhizomes and dense, feather-like fronds. The plant's leaves are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a soft, velvety texture due to the presence of dense trichomes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores for propagation."
