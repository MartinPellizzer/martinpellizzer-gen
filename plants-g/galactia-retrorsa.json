    "intro": "Galactia retrorsa, commonly known as the backward bean or hairy galactia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often along rocky soils and in open woodlands. Its small, pea-like flowers are usually pink or purple, and it produces hairy, leguminous pods that contain small, round seeds. Galactia retrorsa is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial in certain ecological contexts."
