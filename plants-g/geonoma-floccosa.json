    "intro": "Geonoma floccosa, commonly known as the fluff fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that often appear fluffy or velvety. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually small and arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces spores in clusters rather than individual spores. Geonoma floccosa is valued for its ornamental appearance and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitats."
