It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that collect water, a feature common among bromeliads. The plant produces tall, flowering stalks that bear small, clustered white flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
