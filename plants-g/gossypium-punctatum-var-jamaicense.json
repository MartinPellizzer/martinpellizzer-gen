    "intro": "Gossypium punctatum var. jamaicense, commonly known as the Jamaican cotton or wild cotton, is a species of flowering plant in the Malvaceae family. It is native to the Caribbean, particularly Jamaica, and is characterized by its hairy, woolly leaves and small, showy flowers. The plant produces capsules that contain fluffy, white fibers, which are similar to those of cultivated cotton but are not typically harvested for commercial use. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded, moist environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
