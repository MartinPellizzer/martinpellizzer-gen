    "intro": "Grammitis linkiana, commonly known as the New Zealand fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to New Zealand. It typically grows on tree trunks and branches in cool, moist environments. The plant has a compact rosette of dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the leaves. Grammitis linkiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
