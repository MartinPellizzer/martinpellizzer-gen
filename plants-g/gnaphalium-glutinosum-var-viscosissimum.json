    "intro": "Gnaphalium glutinosum var. viscosissimum, commonly known as sticky everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in compact clusters. The plant produces a sticky resin, which gives it its common name and helps protect it from herbivores. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and long-lasting flowers."
