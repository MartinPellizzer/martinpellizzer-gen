    "intro": "Gastrodia hectorii, commonly known as the Hector's ginseng, is a rare and endangered orchid native to New Zealand. It is a myco-heterotrophic plant, meaning it relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrition, lacking chlorophyll and the ability to perform photosynthesis. The plant produces a single, fleshy, yellowish-brown rhizome that stores nutrients and supports its growth. It flowers in late winter to early spring, producing small, greenish-white flowers that are not showy but are adapted for specific pollination mechanisms. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are critical for its survival."
