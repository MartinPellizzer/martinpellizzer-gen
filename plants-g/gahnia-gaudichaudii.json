    "intro": "Gahnia gaudichaudii, commonly known as the coastal gahnia, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shores and dunes, where it is adapted to salty and windy conditions. Its flowering spikes are usually pale green to brown, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Gahnia gaudichaudii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
