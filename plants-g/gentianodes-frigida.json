    "intro": "Gentianodes frigida, commonly known as the cold gentian, is a perennial herb native to alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Gentianodes frigida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in botanical gardens and mountainous landscapes."
