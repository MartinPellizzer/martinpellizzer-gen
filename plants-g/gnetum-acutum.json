    "intro": "Gnetum acutum, commonly known as the tropical climbing gymnosperm, is a unique plant belonging to the Gnetophyta division. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, simple leaves that are often lance-shaped. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers, which are typically unisexual and arranged in clusters. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, three-lobed aril, a feature that distinguishes it from other gymnosperms. Gnetum acutum is native to tropical regions of the Americas and is known for its ability to climb using tendrils."
