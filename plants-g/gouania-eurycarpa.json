    "intro": "Gouania eurycarpa, commonly known as the broad-fruited gouania, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to Central and South America, particularly found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its small, opposite leaves and clusters of small white to pale yellow flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments. Gouania eurycarpa is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
