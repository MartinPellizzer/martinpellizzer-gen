    "intro": "Grastidium somae, commonly known as the moonlight fern, is a rare and elusive plant species native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, silver-haired fronds that shimmer under moonlight, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in shaded, rocky crevices. Its unique reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered in small, inconspicuous clusters along the fronds. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth rate, Grastidium somae is considered a critically endangered species."
