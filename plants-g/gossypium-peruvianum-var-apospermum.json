    "intro": "Gossypium peruvianum var. apospermum, commonly known as the Peruvian cotton or Andean cotton, is a species of wild cotton native to the Andes region of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and produces small, fluffy bolls containing fibrous seeds. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, temperate climates with well-drained soils. Its fibers are shorter and coarser compared to those of cultivated cotton species, making it less commercially viable but valuable for genetic research. This variant is notable for its unique seed structure, which lacks the typical linty covering found in other cotton varieties."
