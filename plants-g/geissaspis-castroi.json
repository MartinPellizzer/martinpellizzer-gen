    "intro": "Geissaspis castroi, commonly known as the Castro's geissaspis, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly through underground stems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
