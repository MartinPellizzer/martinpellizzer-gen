It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in racemes, followed by distinctive, spiny pods that contain several seeds. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant is often found in dry, rocky habitats.
