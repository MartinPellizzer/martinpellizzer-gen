    "intro": "Grastidium collinum, commonly known as the mountain thistle, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its robust, spiny stems and large, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Grastidium collinum thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often growing in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
