    "intro": "Galega tricolor, commonly known as the three-color vetch, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets, and its clusters of small, colorful flowers that range from white to pink and purple. The plant is a legume, meaning it has the ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through its root nodules, making it beneficial for soil enrichment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as fields and rocky areas. Galega tricolor is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
