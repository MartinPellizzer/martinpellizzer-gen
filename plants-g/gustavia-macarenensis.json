    "intro": "Gustavia macarenensis, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its distinctive red pneumatophores, which are specialized root structures that help the plant breathe in waterlogged soil. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in brackish and saltwater environments, playing a crucial role in coastal ecosystems. Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it an important species for stabilizing shorelines and supporting marine biodiversity."
