    "intro": "Grona nemorosa subsp. nemorosa, commonly known as the forest bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe. It typically grows in shaded, moist woodland habitats, where it thrives in partial to full shade. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. Its leaves are lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators in forest ecosystems."
