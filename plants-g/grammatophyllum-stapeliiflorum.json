    "intro": "Grammatophyllum stapeliiflorum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender, white or pale green stems that resemble ghostly figures, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pale green or white flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture to survive. Due to its unique appearance and limited natural habitat, it is considered a conservation concern."
