It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in wetlands and swampy areas, often forming dense stands that contribute to soil stabilization. Gahnia stokesii is valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its aesthetic appeal in wetland restoration projects."
