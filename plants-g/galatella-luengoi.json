    "intro": "Galatella luengoi, commonly known as the Luengoi orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often on tree trunks or rocks in montane forests. Its botanical features include strap-like leaves and a compact, pseudobulbous structure typical of many orchids. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
