    "intro": "Galactia parvifolia var. heterophylla, commonly known as the small-leaved milkweed, is a variant of the Galactia parvifolia species native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves and clusters of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces distinctive, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed areas. This variant is notable for its role in supporting local pollinators and its ornamental value in native plant gardens."
