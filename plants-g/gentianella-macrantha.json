    "intro": "Gentianella macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered gentian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and meadows. The plant features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Gentianella macrantha is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant color."
