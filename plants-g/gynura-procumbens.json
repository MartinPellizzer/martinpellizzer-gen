    "intro": "Gynura procumbens, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that form a rosette shape, creating a cradle for its aerial roots. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often epiphytic, growing on the trunks of trees. Its unique structure allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Gynura procumbens is popular as a decorative plant due to its attractive appearance and low maintenance requirements."
