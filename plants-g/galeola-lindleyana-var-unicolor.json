    "intro": "Galeola lindleyana var. unicolor, commonly known as the single-colored galeola, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves and a single, showy flower that typically blooms in late spring or early summer. The plant prefers shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories where it can receive indirect light. Its unique floral structure features a prominent lip and intricate petal arrangement, making it a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in some regions."
