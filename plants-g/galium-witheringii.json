It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces tiny white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in early summer. Galium witheringii thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its delicate appearance and preference for specific habitats make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
