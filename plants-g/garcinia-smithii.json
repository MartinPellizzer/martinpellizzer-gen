    "intro": "Garcinia smithii, commonly known as the African yellowwood, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, orange-red fruits that contain a single seed, which is encased in a thick, fleshy pulp. Garcinia smithii thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded areas within forests. Its botanical features make it an important species for both ecological and ornamental purposes."
