    "intro": "Glyceria borreri var. islandica, commonly known as the island glyceria, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the North Atlantic. It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in salt marshes and tidal flats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize coastal soils. This variety is notable for its ecological importance in preventing erosion and supporting coastal biodiversity."
