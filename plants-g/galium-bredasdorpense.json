It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and fynbos areas. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain minute seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
