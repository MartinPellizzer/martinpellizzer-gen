    "intro": "Genista godetii, commonly known as the golden broom, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen make it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
