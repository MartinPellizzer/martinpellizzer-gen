    "intro": "Gagea bohemica var. saxatilis, commonly known as the Bohemian spring beauty, is a perennial bulbous plant native to Central Europe. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant typically blooms in early spring and is adapted to grow in rocky or gravelly soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine regions, thriving in well-drained, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
