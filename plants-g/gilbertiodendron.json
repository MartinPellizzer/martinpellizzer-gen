It consists of several species native to tropical Africa, characterized by their deciduous or evergreen trees with compound leaves. The plants are known for their hard, durable wood, which is highly valued in the timber industry. They also play an important ecological role in their native habitats, providing shelter and food for various wildlife. Gilbertiodendron species are often used in reforestation efforts due to their adaptability and ability to thrive in degraded soils."
