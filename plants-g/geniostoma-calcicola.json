It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows on rocky soils, particularly in limestone areas. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are usually basal, fleshy, and adapted to conserve water. Geniostoma calcicola is well-suited to harsh environments and is often found in rocky outcrops and crevices."
