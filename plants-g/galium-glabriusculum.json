    "intro": "Galium glabriusculum, commonly known as smooth bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the central and eastern United States. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are typically oval to elliptic in shape, with smooth margins. Its flowers are white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems, and bloom in late spring to early summer. Galium glabriusculum is often found in open woods, prairies, and along roadsides, where it thrives in partial to full sunlight."
