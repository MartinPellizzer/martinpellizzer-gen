It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats. Gyrostachys odorata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
