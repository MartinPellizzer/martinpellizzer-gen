It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are small, round, and typically turn red when mature. The vine is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
