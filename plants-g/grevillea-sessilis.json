    "intro": "Grevillea sessilis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed waratah, is a striking shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its showy, red or orange flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant features narrow, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. Grevillea sessilis is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is often found in coastal heathlands. Its unique floral structure attracts nectar-feeding birds and insects, making it an important component of local ecosystems."
