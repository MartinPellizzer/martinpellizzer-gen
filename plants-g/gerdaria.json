    "intro": "Gerdaria, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves and striking, white, ghost-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Gerdaria requires specific environmental conditions, including high humidity and filtered light, to thrive. Due to habitat loss and its rarity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
