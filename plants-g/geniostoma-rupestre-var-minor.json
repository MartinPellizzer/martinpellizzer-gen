    "intro": "Geniostoma rupestre var. minor, commonly known as the lesser rock heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in dense clusters along the stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short, hairy pedicels. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal and rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with similar environmental conditions."
