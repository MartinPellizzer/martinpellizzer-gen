    "intro": "Gazania intrusa, commonly known as the invasive gazania, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its vibrant, daisy-like yellow flowers and succulent, fleshy leaves. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it highly adaptable to various environments. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in many regions, often outcompeting native vegetation. Its rapid spread and ability to establish itself in disturbed areas contribute to its status as an invasive species."
