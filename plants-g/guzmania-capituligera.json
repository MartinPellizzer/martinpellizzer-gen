    "intro": "Guzmania capituligera, commonly known as the compact guzmania, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaf structure that collects rainwater, providing a habitat for small aquatic organisms. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that range in color from red to orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its foliage is often adorned with striking patterns and can display a variety of shades depending on light exposure. Guzmania capituligera is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light."
