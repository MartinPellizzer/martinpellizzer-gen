    "intro": "Galeopsis lactiflora, commonly known as narrowleaf horseweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Galeopsis lactiflora is known for its ability to spread rapidly and is considered a weed in some agricultural areas."
