    "intro": "Gnaphalium glutinosum var. medium, commonly known as sticky willow herb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, erect stems covered in a dense layer of fine, sticky hairs. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom from late spring to early summer. The sticky secretions on its leaves and stems serve as a natural defense mechanism against herbivores."
