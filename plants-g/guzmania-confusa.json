    "intro": "Guzmania confusa, commonly known as the pink torch plant, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, pinkish-red bracts that surround a central spadix, creating a visually arresting display. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, forming a central pool that supports aquatic life. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Guzmania confusa is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
