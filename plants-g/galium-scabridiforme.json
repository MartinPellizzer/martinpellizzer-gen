    "intro": "Galium scabridiforme, commonly known as rough-stemmed bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its stems are covered with rough, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. Galium scabridiforme is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is adapted to arid environments."
