    "intro": "Geissanthus sessiliflorus, commonly known as the broad-leaved geissanthus, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of red or orange. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. It has a compact growth habit and produces distinctive, sessile flowers that are adapted for pollination by specific insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
