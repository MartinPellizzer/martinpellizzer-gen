    "intro": "Guzmania elvallensis, commonly known as the Elvallense Bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that can range from red to orange. The plant features a rosette of grass-like leaves that collect water, creating a microhabitat for small organisms. Its roots are primarily used for anchoring rather than nutrient absorption, as it derives most of its nutrients from rainfall and debris. Guzmania elvallensis thrives in high humidity and indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
