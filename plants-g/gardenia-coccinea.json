    "intro": "Gardenia coccinea, commonly known as the red gardenia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and striking red-orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces elliptical, red fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by birds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Gardenia coccinea is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
