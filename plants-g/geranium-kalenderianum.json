    "intro": "Geranium kalenderianum, commonly known as the Kalenderian geranium, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features upright, branching stems that bear clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink and red. The leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate, with a hairy surface that aids in moisture retention. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its prolonged blooming period, which extends from late spring through early autumn."
