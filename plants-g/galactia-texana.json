    "intro": "Galactia texana, commonly known as the Texas milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Galactia texana plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules."
