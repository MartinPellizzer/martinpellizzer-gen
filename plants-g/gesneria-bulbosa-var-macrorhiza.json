    "intro": "Gesneria bulbosa var. macrorhiza, commonly known as the large-flowered gesneria, is a striking tropical plant native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its swollen, bulb-like base that stores water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in dry conditions. The plant features broad, glossy leaves that are often dark green with a waxy texture. Its most notable feature is its large, showy flowers, which are typically orange or red with a prominent yellow center. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
