    "intro": "Gentiana antarctica var. imbricata, commonly known as the Antarctic gentian, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Antarctic and subantarctic islands. It is a member of the Gentianaceae family, characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers. The plant thrives in cold, rocky environments and is adapted to withstand extreme weather conditions. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to reduce water loss. This variant is distinguished by its tightly overlapping leaves, giving it the species name *imbricata*, which means \"overlapping like roof tiles.\""
