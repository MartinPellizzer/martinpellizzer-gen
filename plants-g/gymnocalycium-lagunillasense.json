It is a small, globular plant with a ribbed structure and typically produces pale yellow flowers. The plant has spines that are often white or pale in color, and it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Gymnocalycium lagunillasense is well adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and low rainfall, making it a resilient member of its ecosystem. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
