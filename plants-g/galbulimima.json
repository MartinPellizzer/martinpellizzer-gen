    "intro": "Galbulimima, commonly known as the \"ghost flower,\" is a rare and striking plant native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its unique, bell-shaped flowers that appear in late winter or early spring. The plant has a low-growing, sprawling habit with small, waxy leaves that help it conserve moisture in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically pale green or white, with a faintly fragrant scent, and are pollinated by insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Galbulimima is considered a vulnerable species."
