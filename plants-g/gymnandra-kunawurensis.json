    "intro": "Gymnandra kunawurensis, commonly known as the Kunawure sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and lance-shaped leaves that are glossy on top and dull underneath. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Gymnandra kunawurensis is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional and contemporary crafts. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
