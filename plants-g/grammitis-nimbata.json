    "intro": "Grammitis nimbata, commonly known as the cloud fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique morphology allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Grammitis nimbata is often seen growing on tree trunks or rocks in forest canopies."
