    "intro": "Galinsoga balbisioides, commonly known as creeping galinsoga, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is an annual herb that typically grows in disturbed soils and open areas. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces and small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters. It produces numerous tiny, achene-like seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
