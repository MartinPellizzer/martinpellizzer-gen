    "intro": "Gourmania, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. These plants are characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors, including red, yellow, and orange. The leaves are typically narrow and adapted to reduce water loss, a feature essential for survival in harsh environments. Gourmania species are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants due to their resilience and aesthetic appeal. They play an important role in supporting local biodiversity by providing nectar for pollinators."
