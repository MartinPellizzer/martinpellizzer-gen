    "intro": "Gilbertiodendron ecoukense, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its hard, heavy wood that is highly valued for its durability. The tree has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by pod-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its slow growth and susceptibility to overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
