    "intro": "Gesneria duchartreoides, commonly known as the dwarf gesneria, is a compact evergreen shrub native to Madagascar. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Gesneria duchartreoides is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
