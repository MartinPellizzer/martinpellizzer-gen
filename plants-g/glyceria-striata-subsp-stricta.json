It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically forms dense mats or clumps and is often found in moist soils, such as those in wetlands, marshes, or along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in a panicle, bearing small, two-lobed flowers. Glyceria striata subsp. stricta plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
