    "intro": "Goniophlebium loriceum var. latipes, commonly known as the broad-leafed bladderwort, is a species of aquatic plant native to temperate regions. It is characterized by its floating, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant has thin, ribbon-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
