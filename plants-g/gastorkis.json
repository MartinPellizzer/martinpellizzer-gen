    "intro": "Gastorkis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba. It is a terrestrial orchid that thrives in shaded, moist environments with rich, organic soil. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, white or pale green flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. Gastorkis is known for its unique ability to form symbiotic relationships with specific fungi to obtain nutrients. Due to its habitat specificity and declining population, it is considered a vulnerable species."
