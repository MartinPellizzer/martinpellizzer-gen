    "intro": "Galanthus reginae-olgae subsp. vernalis, commonly known as the Scottish winter aconite, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Scottish Highlands. It features lance-shaped, dark green leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to naturalize over time. This subspecies is closely related to other Galanthus species but is distinguished by its specific geographic origin and floral characteristics."
