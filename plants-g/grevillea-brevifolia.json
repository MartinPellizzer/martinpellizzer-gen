    "intro": "Grevillea brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf waratah, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and striking, tubular red flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for coastal and sandy environments. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, providing a distinctive appearance, while its flowers attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Grevillea brevifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in harsh climates."
