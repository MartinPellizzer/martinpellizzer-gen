    "intro": "Gaultheria glabra f. brachyphylla, commonly known as the dwarf strawberry bush, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of the southern United States. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are typically shorter and broader than those of the species, giving it a compact appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, edible berries similar to those of the common strawberry. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and seasonal fruiting."
