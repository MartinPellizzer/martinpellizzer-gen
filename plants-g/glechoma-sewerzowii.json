    "intro": "Glechoma sewerzowii, commonly known as the Siberian ground-ivy, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky and alpine habitats. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or violet, arranged in whorls along the stems. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a slightly hairy surface, and it has a strong, somewhat minty aroma. Glechoma sewerzowii is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in high-altitude ecosystems."
