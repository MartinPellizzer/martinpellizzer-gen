    "intro": "Glycine debilis, commonly known as the weak bean vine, is a climbing legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three small, ovate leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale yellow or white, followed by elongated, bean-shaped pods containing several seeds. Glycine debilis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
