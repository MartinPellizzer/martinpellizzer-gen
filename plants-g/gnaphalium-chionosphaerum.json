    "intro": "Gnaphalium chionosphaerum, commonly known as the snowball everlasting, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South America. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow florets that resemble snowballs, giving it its common name. The plant produces fluffy, white to grayish cob-like structures that serve as its seed heads, which are often used in floral arrangements. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its flowering period typically occurs in late summer to early autumn, adding a delicate ornamental touch to the garden."
