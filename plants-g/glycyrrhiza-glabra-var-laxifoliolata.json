    "intro": "Glycyrrhiza glabra var. laxifoliolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved licorice, is a variant of the licorice plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pale green leaves with a reduced number of leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates. This variety is valued for its medicinal properties, similar to the common licorice, and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
