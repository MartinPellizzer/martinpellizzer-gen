    "intro": "Gynochthodes ridleyi, commonly known as the Malayan orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and possesses a unique floral structure with a single, showy flower per stem. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insect species, highlighting its ecological niche. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
