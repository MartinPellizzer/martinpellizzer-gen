    "intro": "Gaultheria lepida, commonly known as the dwarf strawberry or wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces delicate white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible and have a sweet, tangy flavor. These fruits are rich in antioxidants and are often used in culinary applications. Gaultheria lepida thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest environments."
