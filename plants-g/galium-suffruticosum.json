    "intro": "Galium suffruticosum, commonly known as creeping bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces and a branched, prostrate stem that often forms dense mats. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Galium suffruticosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
