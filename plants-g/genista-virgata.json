It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring slender, often thorny stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in dense clusters during the spring, which are followed by elongated, leathery pods containing seeds. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several pairs of small, oval leaflets. Genista virgata is adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or coastal areas."
