    "intro": "Gynochthodes lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help in trapping small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in shallow, slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are often submerged or just at the water's surface. Gynochthodes lanuginosa is a carnivorous plant that uses its specialized structures to capture and digest prey, supplementing its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor aquatic environments."
