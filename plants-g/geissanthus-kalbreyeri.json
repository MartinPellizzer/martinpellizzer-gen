    "intro": "Geissanthus kalbreyeri, commonly known as the Kalbreyer's geissanthus, is a rare and unique plant native to the high elevations of Ecuador. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and ixora, and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in cloud forests, where it relies on specific microclimatic conditions. Its foliage is dense and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
