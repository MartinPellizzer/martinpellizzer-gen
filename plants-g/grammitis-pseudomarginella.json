    "intro": "Grammitis pseudomarginella, commonly known as the narrow-margin maidenhair fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows on tree trunks or branches, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, finely divided fronds with a distinctive, narrow margin that gives it its common name. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Grammitis pseudomarginella is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its forest habitat."
