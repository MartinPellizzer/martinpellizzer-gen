It features compound leaves with lanceolate leaflets and produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. It has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. This species is also valued for its role in nitrogen fixation, benefiting surrounding vegetation."
