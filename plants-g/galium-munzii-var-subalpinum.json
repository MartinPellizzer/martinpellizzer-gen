    "intro": "Galium munzii var. subalpinum, commonly known as the subalpine bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as meadows and forest understories at high elevations. The plant features slender stems covered in fine hairs and small, opposite leaves that are often glandular. Its flowers are white or pale pink, arranged in clusters, and bloom in late spring to early summer. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in alpine ecosystems."
