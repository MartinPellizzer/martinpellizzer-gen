    "intro": "Grastidium trilobulatum, commonly known as the three-lobed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features slender, fibrous roots and upright, branching stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, followed by three-lobed, ovate leaves that are characteristic of its species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its botanical significance lies in its unique leaf morphology and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
