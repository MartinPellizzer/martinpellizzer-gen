    "intro": "Garnotia palniensis var. seminudata, commonly known as the naked-stemmed garnotia, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific regions of South Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, characterized by its aromatic compounds and often hollow stems. The plant is distinguished by its reduced foliage and showy, umbellate inflorescences that attract pollinators. Its botanical features include a slender, unbranched stem and small, greenish-white flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
