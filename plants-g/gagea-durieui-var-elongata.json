    "intro": "Gagea durieui var. elongata, commonly known as the long-stemmed gagea, is a rare and delicate bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its bulbs are small and underground, storing nutrients to support its growth during the short flowering season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
