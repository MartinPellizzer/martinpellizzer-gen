    "intro": "[WRONG START] Geloniurn obtusum, commonly known as the African daisy, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. The plant typically grows as a succulent shrub with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its arid native environment. It produces small, yellow disk flowers surrounded by ray florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Geloniurn obtusum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and drought tolerance."
