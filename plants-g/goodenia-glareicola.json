    "intro": "Goodenia glareicola, commonly known as the glacial goodenia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Goodeniaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking blue to violet flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, alpine environments where it forms dense mats to retain moisture and withstand harsh conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in cold, arid climates. Due to its specialized habitat, Goodenia glareicola is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
