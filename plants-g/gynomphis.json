    "intro": "Gynomphis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble a ghostly apparition, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air, soil, and rain. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Gynomphis is considered critically endangered and is a focus of conservation efforts."
