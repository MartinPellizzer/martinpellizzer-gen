    "intro": "Gleditsia triacanthos f. inermis, commonly known as the silky locust, is a deciduous tree native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in racemes during the spring, followed by elongated, flat pods that contain several seeds. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil conditions. The silky locust is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in urban environments."
