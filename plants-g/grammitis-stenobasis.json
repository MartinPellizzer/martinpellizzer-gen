    "intro": "Grammitis stenobasis, commonly known as narrow-leaf grammitis, is a fern species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, creeping growth habit and dark green, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Grammitis stenobasis is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid conditions."
