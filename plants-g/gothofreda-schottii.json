    "intro": "Gothofreda schottii, commonly known as the Schott's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees rather than in soil, and relies on humid, shaded environments for survival. Its flowers are typically small, with intricate patterns and a unique fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, Gothofreda schottii is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
