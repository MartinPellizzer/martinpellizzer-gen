    "intro": "Guettarda sageretioides, commonly known as the coastal guettarda, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a shrub that typically grows near coastal areas, thriving in sandy or limestone soils. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are often clustered in racemes. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in coastal environments. Guettarda sageretioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
