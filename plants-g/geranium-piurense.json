    "intro": "Geranium piurense, commonly known as the Andean geranium, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink and red. The leaves are typically rounded with a slightly hairy texture, and the plant is often found in rocky or alpine environments. It thrives in cool, moist conditions and is adapted to the harsh climate of its native habitat. Geranium piurense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler regions."
