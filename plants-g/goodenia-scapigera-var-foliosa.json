    "intro": "Goodenia scapigera var. foliosa, commonly known as the leafy goodenia, is a perennial herb native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its erect, often branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom during the cooler months. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
