    "intro": "Glossocalyx zenkeri, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvet tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, ovate leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by elliptical, woody fruits. Glossocalyx zenkeri is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitats."
