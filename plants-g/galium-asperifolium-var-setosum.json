    "intro": "Galium asperifolium var. setosum, commonly known as the roughleaf bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its stems are often covered in fine, stiff hairs, contributing to its rough texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and stream banks."
