    "intro": "Granatum obovatum, commonly known as the Persian pomegranate, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves and clusters of small, red, fleshy flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, round fruits with a thick, leathery skin, similar to true pomegranates, though the fruit is typically less juicy. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid climates. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
