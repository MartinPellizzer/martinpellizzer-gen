    "intro": "Grammitis reinwardtioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf moss fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of South America. It typically grows on tree trunks or branches, forming dense, carpet-like mats. The plant has slender, linear leaves that are arranged in a tight, compact rosette. Its fronds are usually dark green and lack true roots, relying instead on rhizomes for nutrient absorption. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests."
