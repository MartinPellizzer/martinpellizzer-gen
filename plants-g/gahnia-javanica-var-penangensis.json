It is characterized by its tall, slender culms and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are typically greenish or reddish in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. This variant is notable for its ecological importance in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
