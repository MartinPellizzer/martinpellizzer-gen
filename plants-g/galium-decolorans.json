    "intro": "Galium decolorans, commonly known as the fading bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Galium decolorans thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks."
