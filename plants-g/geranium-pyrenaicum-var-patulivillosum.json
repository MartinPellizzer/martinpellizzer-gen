    "intro": "Geranium pyrenaicum var. patulivillosum, commonly known as the Pyrenean geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, featuring upright stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers during the summer months, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are palmately divided with a serrated edge, and the plant thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils. It is often found in open woodland and meadow habitats at higher elevations."
