It is a woody vine that can grow up to 10 meters in length, characterized by its opposite, simple leaves and small, scale-like seeds. The plant is notable for being one of the few gymnosperms with a broad, flat leaf structure. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and a subject of interest in plant morphology."
