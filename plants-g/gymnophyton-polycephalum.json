    "intro": "Gymnophyton polycephalum, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a tall, herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features large, umbrella-like leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, and it produces clusters of small, white flowers in late summer. The plant contains phototoxic sap that can cause severe skin irritation when exposed to sunlight. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils along riverbanks and roadsides. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
