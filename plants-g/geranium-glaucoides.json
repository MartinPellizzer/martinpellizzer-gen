    "intro": "Geranium glaucoides, commonly known as the blue geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features upright stems covered with fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a bluish-gray underside. The plant produces clusters of showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming from late winter to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators."
