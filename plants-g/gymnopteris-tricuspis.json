    "intro": "Gymnopteris tricuspis, commonly known as the three-lobed holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically have a triangular or three-lobed shape. The plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Asia, Europe, and North America. Gymnopteris tricuspis prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
