    "intro": "Gaultheria swartzii, commonly known as the red-flowered wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible and have a sharp, peppery flavor, often used in traditional medicine. Gaultheria swartzii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic and aromatic qualities."
