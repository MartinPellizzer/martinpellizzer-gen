    "intro": "Grumilea macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered grumihua, is a striking member of the Malvaceae family native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red, often with a contrasting white throat. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with smooth, glossy green leaves. Its flowers bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Grumilea macrantha is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral display."
