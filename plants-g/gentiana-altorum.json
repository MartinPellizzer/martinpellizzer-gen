    "intro": "Gentiana altorum, commonly known as the tall gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are tubular, with five prominent lobes, and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Gentiana altorum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats."
