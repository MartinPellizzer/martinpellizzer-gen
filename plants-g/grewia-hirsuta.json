    "intro": "Grewia hirsuta, commonly known as the rough globe-thistle, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems covered in short, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in spherical clusters, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered with fine, glandular hairs, giving them a rough texture. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that contains several small, hard seeds."
