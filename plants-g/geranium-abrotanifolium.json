    "intro": "Geranium abrotanifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved geranium, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, narrow, and slightly hairy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained soil. Its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
