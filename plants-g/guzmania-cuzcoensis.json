    "intro": "Guzmania cuzcoensis, commonly known as the Cuzco flame or Cuzco torch, is a striking bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Peru. It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that resembles a torch, often displaying red, orange, or yellow hues. The plant features a rosette of narrow, dark green leaves that collect water, forming a central pool that supports aquatic life. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Guzmania cuzcoensis is popular as a decorative plant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
