    "intro": "Granadilla rubra, commonly known as the pink granadilla, is a tropical vine native to South America. It produces striking red berries that are both ornamental and edible. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and a strong, somewhat unpleasant odor. Its flowers are small and yellow, clustered in panicles, and it thrives in warm, humid climates. The fruit is often used in jams and beverages due to its tart flavor and high vitamin C content."
