    "intro": "Gormania debilis, commonly known as the weak gorm, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gormania debilis is considered a vulnerable species."
