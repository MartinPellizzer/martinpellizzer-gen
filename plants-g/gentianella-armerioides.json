    "intro": "Gentianella armerioides, commonly known as the creeping gentian, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a mat-forming habit, typically found in dry, rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often prostrate or semi-upright. Gentianella armerioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and colorful blooms."
