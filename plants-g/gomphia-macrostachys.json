    "intro": "Gomphia macrostachys, commonly known as the giant grass or giant reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous rhizomes and tall, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 5 meters. The plant produces large, feathery panicles of small, white to pale green flowers, which are often wind-pollinated. Its leaves are long, narrow, and have a bluish-green color with a rough texture. Gomphia macrostachys is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its striking appearance and adaptability to various soil conditions."
