    "intro": "Glycyrrhiza uralensis f. rariflora, commonly known as the rare-flowered licorice, is a rare subspecies of the licorice plant native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its reduced floral display compared to the typical licorice plant, with fewer and smaller flowers. The plant produces a distinctive root that is used in traditional medicine, similar to common licorice. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
