    "intro": "Gynoxys, commonly known as the golden glume, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the southern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in dry, open habitats. The plant features showy yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Gynoxys species are often used in native plant gardens for their ornamental value and ecological benefits."
