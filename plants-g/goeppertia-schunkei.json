    "intro": "Goeppertia schunkei, commonly known as the Emerald Queen, is a compact, evergreen perennial plant native to South America. It features broad, dark green, waxy leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. The plant produces striking, colorful bracts that resemble flowers, though it does not produce true flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Goeppertia schunkei is prized for its ornamental value and is often used as a decorative houseplant."
