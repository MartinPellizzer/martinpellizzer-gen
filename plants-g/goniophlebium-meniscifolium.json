    "intro": "Goniophlebium meniscifolium, commonly known as the moonleaf fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that often curl into a spiral, giving it a unique appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its fronds are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture. Goniophlebium meniscifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
