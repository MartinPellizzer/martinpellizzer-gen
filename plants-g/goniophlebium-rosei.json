It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive rose-colored underside, giving it its common name. Its fronds are often floating or semi-submerged, contributing to the aesthetic and ecological diversity of its habitat. Goniophlebium rosei plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms."
