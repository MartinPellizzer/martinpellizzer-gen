    "intro": "Gonolobus angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
