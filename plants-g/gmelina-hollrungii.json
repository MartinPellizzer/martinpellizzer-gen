    "intro": "Gmelina hollrungii, commonly known as the Java ash or white ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its hard, heavy wood, it has been historically valued for construction and furniture-making."
