    "intro": "Gymnocalycium glaucum subsp. albertovojtechii, commonly known as the Albertovojtech's globose cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spherical or slightly elongated stem that is typically covered in a dense layer of white, powdery bloom. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by small, edible fruits. It is a slow-growing cactus that requires minimal water and thrives in full sun. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in arid gardens."
