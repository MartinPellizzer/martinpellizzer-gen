    "intro": "Gleichenia parallela, commonly known as the parallel fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically arranged in two rows along the stem. The plant is native to various regions in the Southern Hemisphere, including South America, Africa, and Australia. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Gleichenia parallela thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or on rocky surfaces."
