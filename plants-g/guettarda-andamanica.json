It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, white flowers and glossy, dark green leaves. The plant thrives in coastal and brackish water environments, often forming dense thickets in mangrove ecosystems. Its roots help stabilize soil and prevent erosion, making it ecologically significant in tidal zones. It is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
