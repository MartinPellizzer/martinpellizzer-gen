    "intro": "Galium trichopharum, commonly known as the hairy wood-sorrel, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each leaflet having a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellow, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its hairy stems and leaves are adaptations to its wetland habitat, helping to reduce water loss and deter herbivores."
