    "intro": "Geonoma cuneata subsp. indivisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf geonoma, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of rhizomorphs, which help in nutrient absorption. The leaves are usually bipinnate, with a finely divided structure that enhances its ornamental appeal."
