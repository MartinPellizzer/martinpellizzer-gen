    "intro": "Gmelina integrifolia, commonly known as the white flame tree, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are usually entire. The plant produces small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in panicles, which bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its spread in tropical regions. Gmelina integrifolia is often used in reforestation due to its fast growth and ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
