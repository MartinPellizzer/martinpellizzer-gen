    "intro": "Gymnogramma arifolia, commonly known as the feather fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bioluminescent in certain conditions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Gymnogramma arifolia has small, oval-shaped spore-producing structures called sori located on the underside of its fronds. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological studies."
