    "intro": "Gomphichis, commonly known as the bluemink or blue mistflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are perennial herbs native to North America. The plants typically have slender, branching stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. They are often found in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Gomphichis species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
