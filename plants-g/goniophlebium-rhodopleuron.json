    "intro": "Goniophlebium rhodopleuron, commonly known as the red-stemmed fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and delicate, pinnate fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually bright green with a reddish hue on the stems, which gives it its common name. The fronds are often covered in fine, scale-like structures that help retain moisture."
