It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often harvested for their high concentration of glycyrrhizin, a compound used in traditional medicine and as a sweetener. This variety is valued for its adaptability to harsh climates and its medicinal properties."
