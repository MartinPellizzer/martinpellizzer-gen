    "intro": "Grangea, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which often have a silvery or grayish underside due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The flowers are typically small and clustered in racemes, with a distinctive pea-like shape typical of the Fabaceae family. Grangea species are native to various regions in Africa and are often found in dry, rocky habitats. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
