    "intro": "Glossopetalum tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly milkbush, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils."
