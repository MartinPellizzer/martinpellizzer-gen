It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant is distinguished by its soft, hairy stems and leaves, which are often covered in fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are typically yellow and bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Gynerium pilosum is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
