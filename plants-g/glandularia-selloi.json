    "intro": "Glandularia selloi, commonly known as the Sello's glandular verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces glandular hairs on its leaves and stems, which secrete a sticky substance, a feature common in many members of the Verbenaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas. Glandularia selloi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
