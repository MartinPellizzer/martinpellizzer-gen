    "intro": "Grammitis rosarum, commonly known as the rose moss, is a small, perennial fern-like plant belonging to the family Hypnaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and tiny, scale-like leaves that give it a mossy appearance. Native to the temperate regions of the southern United States, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces spore-bearing capsules that are typically clustered at the tips of its stems. Grammitis rosarum is often found in rocky crevices and on the bases of trees, where it forms dense mats that help retain soil moisture."
