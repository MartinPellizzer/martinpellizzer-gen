    "intro": "Grammitis salticola, commonly known as the jumping fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often appear in clusters on tree trunks or branches. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on its host for support rather than soil. Its spore-producing structures are typically found on the underside of its leaves. Grammitis salticola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
