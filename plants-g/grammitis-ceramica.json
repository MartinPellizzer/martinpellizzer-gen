    "intro": "Grammitis ceramica, commonly known as the Ceramic Fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that often form dense, cascading clusters. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with small, spore-producing structures called sori on the underside. Grammitis ceramica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
