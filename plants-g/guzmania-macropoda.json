    "intro": "Guzmania macropoda, commonly known as the giant bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence that can reach up to 3 meters in height, featuring vibrant red bracts. The plant possesses a central rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, forming a pool that supports small aquatic life. Its foliage is often covered in fine, silky hairs that help retain moisture in humid environments. Guzmania macropoda thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil for optimal growth."
