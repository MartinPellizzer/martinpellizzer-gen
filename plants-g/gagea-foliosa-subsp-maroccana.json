    "intro": "Gagea foliosa subsp. maroccana, commonly known as the Moroccan leafy gagea, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Morocco. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is adapted to dry climates and has a short growing season, often blooming in early spring. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly larger leaves and more robust growth compared to other members of the Gagea genus."
