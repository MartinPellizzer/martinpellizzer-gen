    "intro": "Geoherpum alsinifolium, commonly known as the Alsine-leaved Geoherpum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that resemble those of the genus Alsina. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is often found in moist, sandy soils in open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. Geoherpum alsinifolium is a herbaceous perennial that plays a role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining soil stability."
