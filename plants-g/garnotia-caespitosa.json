It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and vibrant purple to pink flower spikes that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that contrasts with the showy inflorescences. Garnotia caespitosa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
