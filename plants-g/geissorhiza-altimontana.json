It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to anchor firmly in its habitat while storing nutrients. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
