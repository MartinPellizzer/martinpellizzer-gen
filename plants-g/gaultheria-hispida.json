    "intro": "Gaultheria hispida, commonly known as the rough strawberry bush, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and hairy, ovate leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are edible and have a tart, slightly sweet flavor. Gaultheria hispida is adapted to cool, moist environments and thrives in shaded or partially shaded woodland areas. Its berries are also used in traditional medicine for their mild analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties."
