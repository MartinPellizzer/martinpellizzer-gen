    "intro": "Gilia longisepala, commonly known as the long-sepal gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often with a white throat. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its sepals are notably elongated, giving it its scientific name, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Gilia longisepala is an important nectar source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
