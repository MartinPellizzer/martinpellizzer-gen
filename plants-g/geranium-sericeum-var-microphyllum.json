    "intro": "Geranium sericeum var. microphyllum, commonly known as the silver geranium, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its finely hairy, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid regions."
