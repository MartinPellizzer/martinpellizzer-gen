It is characterized by its glossy, waxy leaves and clusters of fragrant, yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in well-drained, fertile soil. It prefers partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. The fruit, which is edible, contains seeds that can be used for propagation."
