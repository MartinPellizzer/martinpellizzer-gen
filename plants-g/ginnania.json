It is native to Australia and consists of several species, many of which are characterized by their silver-gray foliage. The plants typically have narrow, linear leaves and produce small, tubular flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple.

They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate drought conditions."
