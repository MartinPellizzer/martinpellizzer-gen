    "intro": "Gymnadenia hygrophila, commonly known as the marsh gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating to help retain moisture in damp environments. Gymnadenia hygrophila plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates."
