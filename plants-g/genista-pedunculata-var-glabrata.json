It features slender, often branching stems that are typically hairless or nearly so, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are alternate and compound, consisting of several pairs of small, oval leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along roadsides."
