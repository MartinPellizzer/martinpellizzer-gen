    "intro": "Gentiana pyrenaica f. longipedunculata, commonly known as the long pedunculate gentian, is a rare and striking botanical variant of the gentian genus. It is characterized by its elongated peduncles, which support large, showy blue to violet flowers. This subspecies is native to the Pyrenees region and thrives in moist, calcareous habitats. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
