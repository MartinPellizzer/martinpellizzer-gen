    "intro": "Geonoma pohliana subsp. kuhlmannii, commonly known as the Kuhlmann's geonoma, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polypodiaceae. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has slender, wiry rhizomes and produces small, clustered leaves that are usually dark green and leathery in texture. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shady garden settings."
