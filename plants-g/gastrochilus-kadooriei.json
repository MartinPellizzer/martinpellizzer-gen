    "intro": "Gastrochilus kadooriei, commonly known as the Kadoorie's orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is a terrestrial orchid with delicate, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, pale yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it faces significant threats to its survival."
