    "intro": "Gumira acuminata, commonly known as the African ironwood tree, is a medium to large evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its thick, dark bark and dense, spreading crown, which provides shade in its natural habitat. The tree produces small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by hard, woody fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Gumira acuminata is valued for its strong, durable wood and is often used in construction and furniture-making."
