    "intro": "Gossypium multiglandulosum, commonly known as the glandular cotton, is a species of cotton native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which are covered in numerous small glands. The plant produces fluffy, white boll-like fruits that contain the fibrous seeds. Its fibrous material is similar to that of other cotton species, though it is less commonly cultivated for commercial use. Gossypium multiglandulosum plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native habitats."
