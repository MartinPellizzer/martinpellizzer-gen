    "intro": "Genosiris umbrosa, commonly known as the shadow iris, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of the Pacific Northwest. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, and it produces delicate, violet-blue flowers during the spring and early summer. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense colonies over time. Genosiris umbrosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in shaded environments."
