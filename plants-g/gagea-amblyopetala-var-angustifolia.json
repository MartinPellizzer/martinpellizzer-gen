    "intro": "Gagea amblyopetala var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved gagea, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to the western United States, particularly California, where it grows in open, rocky habitats. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant has a bulbous root system typical of the genus Gagea. It is often found in dry, sunny areas and is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils."
