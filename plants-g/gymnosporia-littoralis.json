    "intro": "Gymnosporia littoralis, commonly known as the coastal burr bush, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by distinctive, woody fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a fibrous covering. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found along shorelines and dunes. Gymnosporia littoralis plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
