    "intro": "Gomphocarpus prunelloides, commonly known as the sticky weed or purple milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish to purple flowers that bloom throughout the warmer months. Its fruits are follicles that split open to release seeds with silky filaments, aiding in wind dispersal. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
