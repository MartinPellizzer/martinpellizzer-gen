    "intro": "Gomesa tapiraiensis, commonly known as the Tapiraiensis gomesa, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its striking, large, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, and its fruits are capsule-like structures containing numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat-specific requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
