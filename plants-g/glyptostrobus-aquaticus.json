    "intro": "Glyptostrobus aquaticus, commonly known as the water cedar, is a rare and ancient gymnosperm native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical trunk and its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils. The plant has scale-like leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the branches. Its cones are small and typically contain a single seed, which is adapted for water dispersal. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Glyptostrobus aquaticus is considered critically endangered."
