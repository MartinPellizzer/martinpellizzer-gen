It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and rough, bark-like trunk. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically yellow or greenish in color, and it produces woody capsules as fruit. Guarea pilosa is valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
