It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in primary forest understories. Its rhizomes are used in traditional medicine, and it plays a role in the ecological structure of its habitat. Gomesa culuenensis is an important component of Borneo's biodiversity and is considered a conservation priority due to habitat loss."
