    "intro": "Gymnopsis rudbeckioides, commonly known as the roughleaf milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its hairy, ribbed stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by distinctive, follicle-like fruits. Gymnopsis rudbeckioides is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and desert scrub habitats. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
