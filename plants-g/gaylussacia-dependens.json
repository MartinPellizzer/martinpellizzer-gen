It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces bright red berries that are an important food source for wildlife, particularly birds. Its leaves are typically elliptical with a waxy surface and remain green throughout the growing season. Gaylussacia dependens is often found in acidic, sandy soils in open woods or along stream banks."
