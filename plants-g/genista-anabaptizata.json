It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its legume fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are compound, consisting of multiple small, needle-like leaflets, and it is adapted to thrive in arid and rocky environments. Genista anabaptizata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
