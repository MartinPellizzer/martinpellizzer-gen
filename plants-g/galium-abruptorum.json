    "intro": "Galium abruptorum, commonly known as the abrupt mountain bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing herbaceous plant that typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Galium abruptorum is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
