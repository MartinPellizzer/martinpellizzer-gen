    "intro": "Gossypium arboreum var. neglectum, commonly known as the wild cotton tree, is a species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its woody stems and alternate leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by fluffy, cotton-like bolls that contain the fibrous seeds. Its fibrous material is less commercially valuable than that of domesticated cotton species but is used in traditional textile applications. The plant also serves as a host for certain insect pests and is studied for its ecological and genetic significance."
