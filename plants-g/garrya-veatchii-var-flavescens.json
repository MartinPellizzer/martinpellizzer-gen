    "intro": "Garrya veatchii var. flavescens, commonly known as the yellowleaf holly, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that turn a striking yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark blue, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its seasonal color changes and attractive, spiny foliage."
