    "intro": "Gochnatia calophylla, commonly known as the silky bush, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of northern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming during the warmer months. Its leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs, contributing to its common name. Gochnatia calophylla is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
