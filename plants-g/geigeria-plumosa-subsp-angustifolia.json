It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is typically found in grasslands and rocky outcrops. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
