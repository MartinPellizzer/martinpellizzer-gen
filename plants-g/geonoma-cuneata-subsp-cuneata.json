    "intro": "Geonoma cuneata subsp. cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf geonoma, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that often form dense, low-growing mats. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually bioluminescent, though this trait is more pronounced in certain subspecies. The plant plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
