    "intro": "Geonoma stenothyrsa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf geonoma, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of rhizomorphs, which help in absorbing nutrients from the soil. The fronds are usually bioluminescent in some species, though this trait may vary among different populations."
