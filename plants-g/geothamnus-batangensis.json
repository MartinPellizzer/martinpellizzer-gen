    "intro": "Geothamnus batangensis, commonly known as the Batang goldenbush, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are typically narrow and evergreen, adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. Geothamnus batangensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
