    "intro": "Grammadenia pastensis, commonly known as the Pastensean Grammadenia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, typical of bromeliads. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often in a spadix-like structure, and are typically white or pale pink in color. Grammadenia pastensis is adapted to grow in humid, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests at higher elevations."
