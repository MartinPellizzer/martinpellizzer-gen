    "intro": "Galium viscosum var. flavovirens, commonly known as sticky weed or yellow-green bedstraw, is a herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine, sticky hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are small, dry capsules that release tiny seeds when mature. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in woodland edges and along stream banks."
