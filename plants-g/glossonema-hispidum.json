    "intro": "Glossonema hispidum, commonly known as the hairy tongue plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. Glossonema hispidum is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
