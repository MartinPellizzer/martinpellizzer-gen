    "intro": "Gladiolus splendens, commonly known as the fiery gladiolus, is a striking ornamental plant native to South Africa. It features tall, sturdy stems that bear dense clusters of vibrant, colorful flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The flowers are typically spurred at the base, giving them a distinctive appearance reminiscent of a sword, hence the genus name \"gladiolus.\" The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden borders and floral arrangements. Its botanical characteristics make it both visually appealing and relatively easy to cultivate in temperate climates."
