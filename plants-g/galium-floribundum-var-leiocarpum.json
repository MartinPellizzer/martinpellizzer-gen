    "intro": "Galium floribundum var. leiocarpum, commonly known as the smooth false nettle, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features opposite, elliptical leaves that are usually smooth and dark green. Its small, white or pale pink flowers are clustered in umbels, and it produces small, hairy fruits that disperse seeds by wind. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for invertebrates."
