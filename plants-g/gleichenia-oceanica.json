    "intro": "Gleichenia oceanica, commonly known as the oceanic Gleichenia, is a fern native to coastal regions of the southern hemisphere. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or tidal areas. The plant has a distinctive, creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread along the ground. Its fronds are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating to withstand salt spray. Gleichenia oceanica plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and provides habitat for small marine and terrestrial organisms."
