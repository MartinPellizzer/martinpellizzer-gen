    "intro": "Guettarda tournefortiopsis var. crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved guettarda, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its glossy, broad leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. It typically grows as an evergreen shrub, often reaching heights of up to 3 meters. The leaves are usually leathery and have a slightly waxy texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its native habitat."
