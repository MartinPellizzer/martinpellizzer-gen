    "intro": "Gymnogramma congesta, commonly known as the clustered gymnogramma, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its compact, dense fronds that often grow in clusters, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are typically bright green and covered in fine, silky hairs. Gymnogramma congesta thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns."
