    "intro": "Galtonia viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered squill, is a bulbous perennial plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of bell-shaped, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces a single, upright stem that bears several flowers, which are often tinged with purple or pink. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Galtonia viridiflora is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to bloom reliably in mild climates."
