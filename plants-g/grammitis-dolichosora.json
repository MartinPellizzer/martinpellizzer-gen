    "intro": "Grammitis dolichosora, commonly known as the long-stalked shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that often grow in dense clusters. The plant typically has a short, creeping rhizome with numerous aerial roots, which help it attach to tree trunks or other surfaces. Its leaves are usually narrowly lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Grammitis dolichosora thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests or along stream banks."
