    "intro": "Gleditsia coccinea f. inermis, commonly known as the smooth honey locust, is a cultivar of the honey locust tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, thornless stems, which distinguish it from the typical variety that has spines. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval leaflets that turn a striking red in the fall. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters, which are followed by long, slender pods containing edible seeds. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil conditions."
