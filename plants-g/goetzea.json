    "intro": "Goetzea, commonly known as the bottlebrush plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical inflorescences that resemble a bottlebrush, composed of numerous small, bright red or pink flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a glossy surface. Goetzea species are native to regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and are often found in tropical and subtropical climates. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their vibrant floral displays."
