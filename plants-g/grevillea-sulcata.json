It features narrow, strap-like leaves with a distinctive serrated edge, and it produces striking, red or orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water once established. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is suited to coastal and sandy soils. Grevillea sulcata is also an important plant for local wildlife, providing nectar for birds and insects."
