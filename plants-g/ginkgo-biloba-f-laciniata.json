    "intro": "Ginkgo biloba f. laciniata, commonly known as the Japanese or fan-leaf ginkgo, is a unique variant of the ginkgo tree characterized by its finely lobed, fan-shaped leaves. This form exhibits a more pronounced leaf structure compared to the standard ginkgo, with deeply cut edges that give it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically a bright green in summer and turn a striking golden yellow in autumn. It is a deciduous tree that thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The plant is also notable for its ability to tolerate urban environments, making it a popular choice for city landscaping."
