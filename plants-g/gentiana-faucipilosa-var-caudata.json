    "intro": "Gentiana faucipilosa var. caudata, commonly known as the long-tailed gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The variety 'caudata' is distinguished by its elongated, tapering petals, which give it its common name."
