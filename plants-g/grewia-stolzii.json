    "intro": "Grewia stolzii, commonly known as the red gum tree, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in late winter or early spring. The plant produces small, round, red fruits that are edible and often consumed by birds and mammals. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for cultivation in arid and semi-arid regions. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide shade in landscaping."
