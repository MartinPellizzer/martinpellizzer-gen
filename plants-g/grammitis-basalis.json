    "intro": "Grammitis basalis, commonly known as the common grammitis, is a fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has delicate, linear to lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered closely together. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a soft, velvety texture. Grammitis basalis reproduces via spores, which are released from small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves."
