It is characterized by its bright orange to red flowers with yellow centers, which bloom from summer to fall. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves that are tightly arranged along the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a drought-tolerant species suitable for xeriscaping. Gaillardia pinnatifida is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
