    "intro": "Gymnadenia \u00d7 borelii, commonly known as the Borelian grasspocket, is a hybrid orchid species native to the colder regions of Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and dense clusters of pale yellow or greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are grass-like, narrow, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Gymnadenia \u00d7 borelii is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
