    "intro": "Grammitis oncobasis, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, mat-like structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. Grammitis oncobasis plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
