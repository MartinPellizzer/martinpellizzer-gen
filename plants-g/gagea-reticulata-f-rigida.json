    "intro": "Gagea reticulata f. rigida, commonly known as the rigid netted squill, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features a compact, upright growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, reticulate pattern. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pale blue flowers in early spring. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in rocky or well-drained soils, and it is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This variety is distinguished by its more rigid and upright leaf structure compared to the typical form of Gagea reticulata."
