    "intro": "Grastidium ponapense, commonly known as the Ponape Island cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the Pacific island of Pohnpei. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a tropical climate with high humidity. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
