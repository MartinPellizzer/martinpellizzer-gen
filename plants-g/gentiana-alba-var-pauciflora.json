    "intro": "Gentiana alba var. pauciflora, commonly known as the slender gentian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are usually unbranched. This variety is distinguished by its reduced number of flowers compared to the typical Gentiana alba."
