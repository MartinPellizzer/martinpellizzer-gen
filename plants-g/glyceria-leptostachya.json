    "intro": "Glyceria leptostachya, commonly known as slender spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, forming dense, tussock-like clumps. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lipped flowers. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland habitats. Glyceria leptostachya plays an important ecological role in supporting aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
