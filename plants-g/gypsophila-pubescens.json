    "intro": "Gypsophila pubescens, commonly known as the silky sandflower, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery appearance with clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, textured appearance. Gypsophila pubescens is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and is also valued in traditional medicine in some cultures."
