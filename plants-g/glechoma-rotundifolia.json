    "intro": "Glechoma rotundifolia, commonly known as round-leaf ground ivy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces small, pale blue or purple flowers. The plant has a creeping growth habit, with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread aggressively. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its medicinal properties have been historically used for its anti-inflammatory and antiseptic qualities."
