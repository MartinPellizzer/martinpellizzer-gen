It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit and has slender, hairy stems that often lie on the ground. The leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and covered with fine, stiff hairs. Small white flowers appear in clusters, typically in the axils of the leaves, and bloom from late spring to early autumn. This species is often found in moist, disturbed soils in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
