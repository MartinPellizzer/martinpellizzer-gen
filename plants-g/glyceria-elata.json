    "intro": "Glyceria elata, commonly known as tall glyceria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth surface and a prominent midrib. The small, spike-like inflorescence produces tiny flowers that are wind-pollinated, contributing to its role in wetland ecosystems."
