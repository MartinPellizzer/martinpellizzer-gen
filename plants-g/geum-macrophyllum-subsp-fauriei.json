    "intro": "Geum macrophyllum subsp. fauriei, commonly known as the Faurie's avens, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves and tall, branched stems that bear clusters of showy, pinkish-red flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its flowers bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller leaves and more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of *Geum macrophyllum*."
