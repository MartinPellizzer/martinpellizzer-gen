    "intro": "Gnaphalium minimum, commonly known as common cudweed, is a low-growing annual or biennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant has finely divided, silvery-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into fluffy, white seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Gnaphalium minimum is often found in disturbed soils, lawns, and along roadsides, where it thrives in sunny, dry environments."
