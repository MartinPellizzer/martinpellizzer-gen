    "intro": "Grewia umbellifera, commonly known as the sour fig or wild sour plum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often hairy and have a sour scent. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which are followed by fleshy, yellow or orange berries. These berries are edible but have a tart flavor and are often used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats."
