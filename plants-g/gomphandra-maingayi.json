    "intro": "Gomphandra maingayi, commonly known as the African ghost fern, is a rare and enigmatic fern species native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often in rocky or humus-rich soils. Its reproductive structures are concealed within the fronds, making it challenging to study in the wild. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gomphandra maingayi is considered a species of conservation concern."
