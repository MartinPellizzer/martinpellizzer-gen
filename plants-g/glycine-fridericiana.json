    "intro": "Glycine fridericiana, commonly known as the climbing bean or the sweet pea vine, is a leguminous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its vigorous climbing habit and trifoliate leaves composed of three small, heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer, followed by flat, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. Glycine fridericiana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional herbal medicine. Its growth is favored in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade."
