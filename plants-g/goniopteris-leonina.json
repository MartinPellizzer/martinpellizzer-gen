    "intro": "Goniopteris leonina, commonly known as the Leonine water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into small, feather-like segments. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it can receive ample sunlight. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Goniopteris leonina plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life."
