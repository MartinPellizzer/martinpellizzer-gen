    "intro": "Glaphyropteris carolinensis, commonly known as the Carolina water fern, is a prehistoric fern that lived during the Carboniferous period. It is characterized by its large, complex fronds with a distinctive, shield-shaped structure. The plant thrived in swampy, wet environments, contributing to the formation of coal deposits. Its leaves were typically bipinnate, with a high number of small, closely arranged pinnae. Fossil records indicate that it was a significant component of ancient flora, playing a role in the carbon cycle of that era."
