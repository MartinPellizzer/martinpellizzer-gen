    "intro": "Gesneria leucomalla, commonly known as the white-leaved gesneria, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its glossy, white-variegated leaves that contrast beautifully with its dark green stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming during the warmer months. Gesneria leucomalla thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical plant collections."
