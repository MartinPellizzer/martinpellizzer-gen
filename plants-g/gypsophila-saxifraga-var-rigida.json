It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
