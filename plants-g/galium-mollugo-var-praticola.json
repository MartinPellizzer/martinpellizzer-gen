    "intro": "Galium mollugo var. praticola, commonly known as common bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats of prostrate stems covered with small, opposite leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Its small, capsule-like fruits contain numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
