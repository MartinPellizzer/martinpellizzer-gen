    "intro": "Galliaria patula, commonly known as the common galliaria, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, showy flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces distinctive, spherical galls on its stems, which are a unique botanical feature. These galls are formed in response to insect herbivory, making Galliaria patula an interesting subject in plant-insect interactions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
