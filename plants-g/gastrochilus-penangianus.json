    "intro": "Gastrochilus penangianus, commonly known as the Penang stone orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in Malaysia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in loose inflorescences. Its leaves are usually ovate to elliptic, with a smooth surface and a waxy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native region."
