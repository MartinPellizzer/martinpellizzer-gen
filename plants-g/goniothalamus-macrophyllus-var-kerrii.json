It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length, making it one of the largest ferns in the world. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in swampy areas and along riverbanks. Its fronds are typically floating or semi-submerged, contributing to its role in aquatic ecosystems. The plant's botanical significance lies in its distinctive morphology and its importance in the study of aquatic plant evolution."
