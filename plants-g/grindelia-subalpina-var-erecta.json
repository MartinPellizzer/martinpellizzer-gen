    "intro": "Grindelia subalpina var. erecta, commonly known as the erect giant goldenweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces a sticky resin that is released when the leaves are disturbed. It thrives in dry, sunny environments such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This variety is often found in higher elevation areas, where it adapts to cooler and drier conditions."
