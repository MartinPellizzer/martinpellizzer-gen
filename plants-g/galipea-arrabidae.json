    "intro": "Galipea arrabidae, commonly known as the Arrabida chestnut, is a species of flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces woody capsules that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
