    "intro": "Gymnogramma peruviana var. major, commonly known as the Peruvian gymnogramma, is a fern species native to South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds with a distinctive, narrow, and elongated shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. The leaves are usually bipinnate, with small, linear pinnae that give the plant a lacy appearance."
