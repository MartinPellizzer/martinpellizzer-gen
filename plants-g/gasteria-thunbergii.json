    "intro": "Gasteria thunbergii, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a succulent perennial native to South Africa. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, dark green leaves with white or yellow markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant produces upright, branching stems that bear clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and requiring minimal watering. Gasteria thunbergii is popular as a low-maintenance houseplant due to its attractive appearance and resilience."
