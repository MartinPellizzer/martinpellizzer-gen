    "intro": "Gleichenia monticola, commonly known as the mountain Gleichenia, is a fern that belongs to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically lance-shaped and have a distinctive, rugged texture. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its fronds, a feature common among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or on rock surfaces. Gleichenia monticola is native to various regions in the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Asia, Europe, and North America."
