    "intro": "Gentianella bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine pubescence, while its stems are usually unbranched and hairy. The two-colored gentian is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant, short-lived blooms."
