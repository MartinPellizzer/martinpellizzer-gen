    "intro": "Galium globuliferum, commonly known as globular bedstraw, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a small, round achene enclosed in a persistent calyx, giving it a distinctive appearance. Galium globuliferum typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
