    "intro": "Griffithia latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved griffithia, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the island of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Gnetaceae, which includes gymnosperms, and is considered one of the most primitive living members of this group. The plant is characterized by its simple, broad leaves and small, scale-like seeds. It grows as a shrub or small tree, typically in moist, shaded forest environments. Due to its unique evolutionary traits, it is of great interest to botanists studying the origins of flowering plants."
