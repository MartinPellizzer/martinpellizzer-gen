It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that resemble snowballs, hence its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and has a compact, bushy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its delicate flowers bloom in late summer, adding a charming, airy effect to the landscape."
