    "intro": "Goodyera rubrovenia, commonly known as the red-veined lady's slipper, is a terrestrial orchid native to the forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and a striking, showy flower with a deep red lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly bees, and it produces small, dark brown seeds. Goodyera rubrovenia is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
