    "intro": "Gilia eremica var. yageri, commonly known as the Yager's gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Gilia eremica var. yageri is often found in desert scrub and chaparral ecosystems, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinators and soil stability."
