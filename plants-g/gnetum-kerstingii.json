    "intro": "Gnetum kerstingii, commonly known as the African kemp, is a member of the Gnetophyta, a group of gymnosperms that includes only three genera. It is a woody plant that typically grows as a shrub or small tree, characterized by its opposite, simple leaves and distinctive, often fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, unisexual flowers, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, and it relies on wind pollination. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, red or yellowish aril, which is an adaptation for animal dispersal."
