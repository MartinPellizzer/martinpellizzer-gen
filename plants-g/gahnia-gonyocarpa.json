    "intro": "Gahnia gonyocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wetland and swampy environments, contributing to the ecological stability of these habitats. Gahnia gonyocarpa is an important component of the vegetation in eastern and southern Australia."
