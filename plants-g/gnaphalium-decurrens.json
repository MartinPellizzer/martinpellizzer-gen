    "intro": "Gnaphalium decurrens, commonly known as the creeping cudweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of slender, hair-covered stems that spread along the ground. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by fluffy, white seed heads. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and wetlands. Its foliage is characterized by narrow, linear leaves with a soft, woolly texture."
