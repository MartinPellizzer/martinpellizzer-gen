    "intro": "Genista corsica, commonly known as Corsican broom, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its slender, shrub-like form typically grows in rocky or dry soils, adapting well to coastal and mountainous environments. Genista corsica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid regions."
