    "intro": "Glochidion oreichtitum subsp. tsaratananense, commonly known as the Tsaratanana glochidion, is a species of flowering plant in the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are usually pubescent. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in the rainforests of the eastern part of the island. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
