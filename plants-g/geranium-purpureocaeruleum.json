    "intro": "Geranium purpureocaeruleum, commonly known as the blue geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features upright stems that bear opposite, palmately lobed leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, which bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and ability to attract pollinators."
