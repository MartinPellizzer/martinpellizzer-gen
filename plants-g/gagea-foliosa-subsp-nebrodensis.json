    "intro": "Gagea foliosa subsp. nebrodensis, commonly known as the Nebrodensis spring beauty, is a rare and delicate bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant prefers well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its bulbous structure allows it to survive harsh winter conditions and regenerate in the following growing season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
