    "intro": "Gussonea, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which are adapted to coastal environments. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along shorelines, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, aiding in water retention. Gussonea is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
