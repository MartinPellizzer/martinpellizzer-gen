    "intro": "Guajava pyrifera, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It has compound leaves with multiple ovate to lance-shaped leaflets, and its small, fragrant white flowers are followed by red, fleshy berries. The plant is adapted to coastal and wetland environments, often growing in brackish water areas. It has a deep root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ecological impact."
