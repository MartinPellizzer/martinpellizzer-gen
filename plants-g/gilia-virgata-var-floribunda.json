    "intro": "Gilia virgata var. floribunda, commonly known as the showy gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of vibrant pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, oval leaves that are typically arranged opposite along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry slopes and rocky areas. The showy gilia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
