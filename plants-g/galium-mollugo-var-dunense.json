It features small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks."
