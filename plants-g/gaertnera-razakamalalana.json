    "intro": "Gaertnera razakamalalana, commonly known as the Madagascar ironwood, is a rare and endemic species native to the rainforests of Madagascar. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and thick, bark-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its wood is highly valued for its strength and durability, making it a significant resource in local communities. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered threatened and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
