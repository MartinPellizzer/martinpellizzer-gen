    "intro": "Geissanthus submembranaceus, commonly known as the slender geissanthus, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a shrub characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of branches. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
