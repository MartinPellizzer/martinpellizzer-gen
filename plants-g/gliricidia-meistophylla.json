    "intro": "Gliricidia meistophylla, commonly known as the stinkwood tree, is a fast-growing leguminous tree native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It has compound leaves that are typically trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually pale yellow or white, followed by elongated pods containing flattened, kidney-shaped seeds. It is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in agroforestry and soil enrichment. The tree is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber and fodder."
