It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that give it a feathery appearance, and it is often grown as an ornamental plant in gardens. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for shaded garden areas. Guettarda elegans is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
