    "intro": "Gnetum oblongifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf gnetum, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is a member of the gymnosperm group, although it exhibits some angiosperm-like features, such as vessel elements in its xylem. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, with alternate, simple, and often elliptical or oblong leaves. Its flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. Gnetum oblongifolium is valued for its ornamental leaves and has traditional uses in some cultures for medicinal purposes."
