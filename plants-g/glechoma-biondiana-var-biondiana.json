    "intro": "Glechoma biondiana var. biondiana, commonly known as the silverweed or creeping charlock, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe. It features heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silver-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by four-angled, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its hairy leaves and rapid spread make it both a notable ornamental and a potential weed in certain habitats."
