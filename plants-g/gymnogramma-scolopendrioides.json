    "intro": "Gymnogramma scolopendrioides, commonly known as the creeping maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and have a creeping growth habit. The plant features rhizomes that spread along the soil surface, allowing it to colonize shaded, moist environments. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Gymnogramma scolopendrioides is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, shaded habitats."
