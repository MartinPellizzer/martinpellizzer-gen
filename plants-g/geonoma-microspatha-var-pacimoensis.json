    "intro": "Geonoma microspatha var. pacimoensis, commonly known as the Paci\u00f1o's dwarf fern, is a compact, evergreen fern native to the humid lowland forests of Central and South America. It features a rosette of narrow, leathery, dark green fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and conservation efforts."
