    "intro": "Gregoria vitaliana subsp. praetutiana, commonly known as the Praetutian gregoria, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, velvety foliage that helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale pink or white, adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, with a waxy cuticle that reduces water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat destruction."
