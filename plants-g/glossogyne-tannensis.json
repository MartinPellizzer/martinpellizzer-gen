    "intro": "Glossogyne tannensis, commonly known as the Tanninbark Tree, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark that exudes a tannin-rich sap, which has been historically used in tanning leather. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a waxy coating. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in clusters and are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Glossogyne tannensis is valued for its ecological role and has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes."
