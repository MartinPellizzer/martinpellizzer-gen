    "intro": "Gentiana crinita var. cervantesii, commonly known as the Cervantes' gentian, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often branched and slender. This rare variety is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
