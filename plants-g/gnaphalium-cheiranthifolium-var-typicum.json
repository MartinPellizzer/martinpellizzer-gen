    "intro": "Gnaphalium cheiranthifolium var. typicum, commonly known as the woolly bluemink, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers that are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. Its leaves are typically narrow, linear, and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving the plant a soft, woolly appearance. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands, often growing in nutrient-poor soils."
