    "intro": "Gnaphalium cuneifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cudweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is typically found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks. It produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Gnaphalium cuneifolium is often used in native plant gardens due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
