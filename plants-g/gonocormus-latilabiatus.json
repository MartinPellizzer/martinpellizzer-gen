    "intro": "Gonocormus latilabiatus, commonly known as the broad-lipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature a wide, flat lip and vibrant colors such as yellow and orange. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with each stem producing a series of leaves and flower spikes. Its roots are often rhizomatous, allowing it to spread and form clumps in suitable habitats. The orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
