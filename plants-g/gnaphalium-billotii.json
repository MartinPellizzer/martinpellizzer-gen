It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to survive in dry, hot environments. Its small, yellowish flowers are surrounded by pale green bracts, and it produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Gnaphalium billotii is often found in coastal areas and is considered a resilient species in its native habitat."
