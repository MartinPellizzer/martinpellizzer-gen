It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves and yellow-orange flower heads that bloom in late summer. Its flowers are composed of both ray and disk florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
