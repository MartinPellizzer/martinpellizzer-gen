    "intro": "Goodenia stolonifera, commonly known as the stoloniferous goodenia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Australia. It features a sprawling growth habit with creeping stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Goodenia stolonifera is often found in sandy or rocky soils in open habitats such as grasslands and heathlands."
