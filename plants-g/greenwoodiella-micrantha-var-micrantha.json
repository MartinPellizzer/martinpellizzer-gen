    "intro": "Greenwoodiella micrantha var. micrantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved greenwoodiella, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth texture, and it produces capsules as its fruiting body. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
