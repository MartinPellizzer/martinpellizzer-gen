It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with photosynthesis occurring through its pale green stems. Native to the mountainous regions of southern China, it thrives in cool, humid environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Due to its specialized habitat and conservation status, it is considered endangered and requires careful cultivation."
