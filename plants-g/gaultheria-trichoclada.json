    "intro": "Gaultheria trichoclada, commonly known as the hairy wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants such as blueberries and heathers. The plant is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are covered in fine, whitish hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are typically pink or white and appear in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are edible for both humans and wildlife. Gaultheria trichoclada is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions."
