    "intro": "Guarea pterorhachis, commonly known as the bird's nest tree, is a member of the Sapotaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a large evergreen tree that can reach heights of up to 30 meters, characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, gray bark. The tree produces small, white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by round, yellowish fruits containing a single, large seed. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a distinctive ovate shape with a short petiole. The plant is valued for its hard, heavy wood and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
