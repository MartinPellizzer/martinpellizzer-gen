    "intro": "Gongylolepis terramarae, commonly known as the terramarae gongylolepis, is a rare and elusive plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes caraway and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental changes. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies."
