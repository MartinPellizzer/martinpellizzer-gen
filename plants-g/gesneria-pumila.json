    "intro": "Gesneria pumila, commonly known as the dwarf gesneria, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It features lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green, with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically blooming in the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Gesneria pumila is prized for its compact size and vibrant floral display, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
