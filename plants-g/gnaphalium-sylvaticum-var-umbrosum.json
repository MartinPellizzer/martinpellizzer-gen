    "intro": "Gnaphalium sylvaticum var. umbrosum, commonly known as the shade gentian, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in shaded environments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora."
