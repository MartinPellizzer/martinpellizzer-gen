    "intro": "Goodyera denticulata, commonly known as the toothed maidenhair fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bright green, lance-shaped leaves with finely toothed margins. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded forest environments. Its rhizomes are short and produce a dense rosette of foliage. Goodyera denticulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady garden settings."
