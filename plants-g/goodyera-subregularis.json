    "intro": "Goodyera subregularis, commonly known as the irregular lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and possesses narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky texture. The plant produces showy, dark green to brownish purple flowers arranged in a loose, irregular spike. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and is often found in association with decaying organic matter. Goodyera subregularis is an epiphytic or lithophytic species, meaning it can grow on trees or rocks, and it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
