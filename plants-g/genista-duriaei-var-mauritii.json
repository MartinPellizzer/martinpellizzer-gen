It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. The plant features small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, and its leaves are typically trifoliate, with three leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the tropical climate of its native habitat. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
