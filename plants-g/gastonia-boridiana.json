    "intro": "Gastonia boridiana, commonly known as the red-stemmed cycad, is a unique cycad species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk that is often reddish in color, giving it its common name. The plant produces large, feather-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern around the trunk. Its cones are separate, with male and female cones occurring on different plants, a feature typical of cycads. Gastonia boridiana is adapted to arid environments and requires well-drained soil to thrive."
