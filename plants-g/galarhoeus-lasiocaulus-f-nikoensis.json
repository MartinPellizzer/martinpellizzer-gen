    "intro": "Galarhoeus lasiocaulus f. nikoensis, commonly known as the Niko's haircap, is a rare and unique plant species belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its small, spike-like inflorescences bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, a common trait among sedges. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
