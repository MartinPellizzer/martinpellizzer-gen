It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and bright red or orange flowers that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant is adapted to dry, sandy soils and thrives in full sun. It is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance. The flowers attract nectar-feeding birds and insects, contributing to local biodiversity."
