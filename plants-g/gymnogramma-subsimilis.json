    "intro": "Gymnogramma subsimilis, commonly known as the similar shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its small, leathery, and often densely packed fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in small, rounded structures called sorangia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Gymnogramma subsimilis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in indoor settings."
