    "intro": "Gymnopogon rigidus, commonly known as the rigid grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its erect, stiff stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Gymnopogon rigidus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
