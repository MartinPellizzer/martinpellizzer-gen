    "intro": "Grindelia paludosa, commonly known as marsh gumweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. This species typically grows in wet meadows and marshy areas, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into fluffy, white seed heads. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
