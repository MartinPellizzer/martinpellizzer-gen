    "intro": "Gesneria pedunculosa, commonly known as the mountain gesneria, is a flowering plant native to the humid forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat, and it has thick, waxy leaves that help retain moisture. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Gesneria pedunculosa is popular among horticulturists for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation indoors."
