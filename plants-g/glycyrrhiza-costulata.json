It is characterized by its erect stem, pinnately compound leaves, and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its medicinal roots, which are rich in glycyrrhizin.
