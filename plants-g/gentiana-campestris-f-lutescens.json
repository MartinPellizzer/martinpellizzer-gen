This perennial plant features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in the species, but in this form, they exhibit a distinctive yellow hue. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and grasslands. The plant has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in the summer months. Its unique coloration makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and botanical study."
