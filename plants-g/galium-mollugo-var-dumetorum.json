    "intro": "Galium mollugo var. dumetorum, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces clusters of tiny, white, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, and it spreads through both seeds and rhizomes. It is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a common weed in cultivated areas."
