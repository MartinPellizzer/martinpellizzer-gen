    "intro": "Gnaphalium paniculatum, commonly known as the clustered everlasting, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, fluffy white flowers that are often used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. Its foliage is typically gray-green, covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss."
