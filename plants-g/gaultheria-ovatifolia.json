    "intro": "Gaultheria ovatifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaved wintergreen, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the Americas. It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its leaves contain methyl salicylate, a compound responsible for its distinctive wintergreen scent. Gaultheria ovatifolia is often found in moist, acidic soils in forested areas."
