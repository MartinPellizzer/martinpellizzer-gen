    "intro": "Guzmania zahnii var. longiscapa, commonly known as the long-spurred guzmania, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that displays a range of colors, including red, orange, and yellow. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect rainwater, providing a habitat for small aquatic organisms. Its flowers are borne on a tall, branching stem, with elongated bracts that give it its varietal name. This species is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
