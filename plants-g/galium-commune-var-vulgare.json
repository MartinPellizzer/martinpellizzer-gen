    "intro": "Galium commune var. vulgare, commonly known as common bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Galium commune var. vulgare is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodland floors and stream banks."
