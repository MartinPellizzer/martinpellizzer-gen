    "intro": "Gochnatia hypoleuca subsp. obtusata, commonly known as the broad-leaved gochnatia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and oval, leathery leaves that are usually arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, which bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or disturbed habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
