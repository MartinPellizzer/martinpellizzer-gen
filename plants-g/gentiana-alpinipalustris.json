    "intro": "Gentiana alpinipalustris, commonly known as the alpine gentian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, rocky habitats at high altitudes, often in alpine meadows and tundra. The plant is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are basal, lance-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Gentiana alpinipalustris is valued for its ornamental beauty and its role in supporting local pollinators in its native ecosystems."
