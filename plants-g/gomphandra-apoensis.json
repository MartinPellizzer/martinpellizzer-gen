    "intro": "Gomphandra apoensis, commonly known as the Philippine water fern, is a rare aquatic fern native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are adapted for life in freshwater environments. The plant typically grows in slow-moving streams and marshy areas, where it thrives in moist, shaded conditions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family. Due to habitat loss, Gomphandra apoensis is considered endangered and is of significant interest in botanical research."
