    "intro": "Grewia retusa, commonly known as the red bush willow, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has simple, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds. Grewia retusa is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
