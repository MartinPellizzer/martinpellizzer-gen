    "intro": "Gesneria melittifolia, commonly known as the honeybee gesneria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are glossy and dark green, often with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Gesneria melittifolia is prized for its ornamental value and requires bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive."
