    "intro": "Gynura angulosa, commonly known as the angular gynura, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its serrated, angular leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are often overlooked due to the plant's more striking foliage. Gynura angulosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its unique leaf structure and ability to thrive in shaded environments. It is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures for its purported health benefits."
