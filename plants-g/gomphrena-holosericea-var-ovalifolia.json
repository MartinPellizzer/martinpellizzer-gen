    "intro": "Gomphrena holosericea var. ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf gomphrena, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces clusters of small, spiky, pink or red bracts that resemble tiny flowers. The leaves are ovate to elliptical in shape, often with a slightly hairy surface, and are arranged alternately along the stems. This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value lies in its long-lasting, colorful bracts that add visual interest throughout the growing season."
