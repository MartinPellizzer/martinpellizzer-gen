    "intro": "Geum rivale ambiguum, commonly known as the water avens, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. The plant features basal leaves that are heart-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
