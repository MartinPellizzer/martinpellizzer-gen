    "intro": "Gymnadenia helferi, commonly known as the Helfer's grasspinks, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the orchid family (Orchidaceae). It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear whorls of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, with a distinctive spurred lip. Gymnadenia helferi is native to parts of Europe and is often found in meadows and grassy habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
