    "intro": "Grammitis azorica, commonly known as the Azorean fern, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the Azores. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Grammitis azorica is considered a vulnerable species."
