    "intro": "Gahnia filifolia, commonly known as the slender tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in wetland or swampy areas, where it forms extensive tussocks that help stabilize the soil. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets, which are usually pale green to brown in color. Gahnia filifolia plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for various invertebrates and birds."
