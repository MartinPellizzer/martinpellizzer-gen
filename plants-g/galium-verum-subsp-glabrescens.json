    "intro": "Galium verum subsp. glabrescens, commonly known as yellow bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems covered with small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are opposite, simple, and usually have a slightly hairy texture, though the subspecies glabrescens is generally smoother than the typical form. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can spread through rhizomes, forming dense mats."
