    "intro": "Gentiana kurroo var. kurroo, commonly known as the Kuroo gentian, is a striking perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear clusters of blue to violet flowers, which bloom during the summer months. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help protect it from harsh weather conditions. This species is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological importance in supporting local biodiversity."
