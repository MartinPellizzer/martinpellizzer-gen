    "intro": "Gentiana trailliana var. minima, commonly known as the dwarf gentian, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of the western United States. It features dark blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
