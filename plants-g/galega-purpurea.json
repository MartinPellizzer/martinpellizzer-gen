It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, purple or pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces pod-like fruits containing several seeds, and its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets. Galega purpurea is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a useful plant in agricultural settings. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields."
