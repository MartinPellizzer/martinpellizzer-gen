    "intro": "Gentiana faucipilosa, commonly known as the blue gentian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its stem is unbranched and bears the flowers at the top. Gentiana faucipilosa is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant color."
