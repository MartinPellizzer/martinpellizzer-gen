    "intro": "Genlisea hispidula subsp. subglabra, commonly known as the slender bladderworts, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic habit. The plant possesses specialized bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. Its leaves are typically reduced to tendrils, and it lacks true stems. This subspecies is distinguished by its smooth, glabrous leaves, which set it apart from the more hairy form of the species."
