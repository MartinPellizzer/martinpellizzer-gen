It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in saline soils and is often found in marshes, dunes, and other coastal habitats. Its adaptability to salt-rich environments makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
