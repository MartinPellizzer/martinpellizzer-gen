    "intro": "Gomphichis fernandezii, commonly known as the Fernandez's gomphichis, is a rare fern species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often exhibit a bluish-green hue. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in cloud forests at high elevations. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in the Polypodiaceae family. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
