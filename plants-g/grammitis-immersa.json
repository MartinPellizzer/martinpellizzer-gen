    "intro": "Grammitis immersa, commonly known as the submerged fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are often found growing on the surfaces of trees or rocks in moist, shaded environments. The plant typically has a creeping rhizome with short, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety layer. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are usually located on the undersides of the fronds. Grammitis immersa is adapted to thrive in humid conditions and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
