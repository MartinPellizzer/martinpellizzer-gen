    "intro": "Galium bussei var. glabrum, commonly known as smooth bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with fine hairs, though the variety 'glabrum' is distinguished by its smoother, hairless surface. Galium bussei var. glabrum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
