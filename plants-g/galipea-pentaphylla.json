    "intro": "Galipea pentaphylla, commonly known as the Mexican rosewood, is a species of flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant is valued for its hard, dark wood, which is used in the production of musical instruments and furniture. Galipea pentaphylla typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in dry or semi-arid environments. Due to overharvesting, it is considered an endangered species in many areas."
