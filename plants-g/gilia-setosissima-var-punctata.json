    "intro": "Gilia setosissima var. punctata, commonly known as the spotted gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The leaves are usually narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, cylindrical fruits that contain several seeds. It is often found in sandy or rocky soils along dry streambeds and in open woodlands."
