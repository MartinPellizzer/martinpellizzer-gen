    "intro": "Galium erectum var. pubescens, commonly known as hairy bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, often hairy stems that rise from a rhizomatous root system, and its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its fruits are small, dry capsules that release tiny seeds, aiding in its spread. Hairy bedstraw is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
