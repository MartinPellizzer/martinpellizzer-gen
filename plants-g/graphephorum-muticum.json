    "intro": "Graphephorum muticum, commonly known as the common staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, tree-like appearance with a thick, fibrous root system that anchors it to host trees. The plant produces a large, fleshy, shield-shaped frond that can grow up to 1 meter in diameter. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its unique morphology and ability to absorb moisture from the air make it well adapted to its ecological niche."
