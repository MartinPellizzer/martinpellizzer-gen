    "intro": "Gordonia brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved gordonia, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats. Gordonia brevifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
