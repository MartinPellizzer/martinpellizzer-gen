    "intro": "Genlisea pusilla, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a small carnivorous plant native to South America. It is notable for its unique trapping mechanism, which consists of bladder-like structures that capture tiny aquatic invertebrates. The plant's leaves are modified into complex, root-like structures that function as traps. It thrives in nutrient-poor wetlands and requires consistent moisture and indirect light. Its delicate appearance and specialized adaptations make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies."
