    "intro": "Gyrostachys scopulariae, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with small, narrow leaves adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy and rocky soils. Gyrostachys scopulariae plays a vital role in stabilizing desert soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
