    "intro": "Gentianella raimondiana, commonly known as the Raimond's gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and often branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in several European countries."
