    "intro": "Glyceria fluitans var. declinata, commonly known as the leaning watergrass, is a variant of the watergrass species native to wetland environments. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, creeping stems that often grow along the surface of water or moist soil. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often floating or partially submerged, adapting to aquatic conditions. This variant is often found in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and stream edges."
