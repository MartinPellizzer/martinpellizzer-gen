    "intro": "Geissois bradfordii, commonly known as the golden rain tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its compound leaves that turn bright yellow in the fall, and its showy, drooping clusters of golden yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adaptable to various soil types. It prefers full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. The golden rain tree is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
