It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its unique, candle-like appearance with thick, cylindrical stems. The plant features spines and produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening. Gayophytum is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and resilience."
