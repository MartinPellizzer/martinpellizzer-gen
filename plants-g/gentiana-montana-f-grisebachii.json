    "intro": "Gentiana montana f. grisebachii, commonly known as the gray gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and alpine meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with a fine, grayish-white down, which gives the species its common name. The flowers are tubular with five lobes and are pollinated primarily by insects like bees and flies."
