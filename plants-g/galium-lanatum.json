    "intro": "Galium lanatum, commonly known as sticky willow or woolly bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It features slender, creeping stems covered in dense, soft white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine, silky hairs, contributing to its distinctive look. Galium lanatum is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
