    "intro": "Glycine borianii, commonly known as the Chinese evergreen, is a climbing legume native to China. It features trifoliate leaves with three small, ovate leaflets and produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters. The plant is characterized by its vigorous growth and ability to twine around supports, making it suitable for trellises or arbors. Its seeds are enclosed in hairy pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Glycine borianii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its foliage and climbing habit."
