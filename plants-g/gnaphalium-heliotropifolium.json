    "intro": "Gnaphalium heliotropifolium, commonly known as the sunflower leaf everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its small, showy composite flowers. The plant produces fluffy, white to pale yellow florets that are often used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a scent reminiscent of heliotrope, contributing to its common name."
