    "intro": "Gossypium australiense, commonly known as the Australian cotton tree, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems and capsule fruits that contain fluffy, white fibers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss. The fibers produced by Gossypium australiense have been historically used by Indigenous Australians for making textiles and other crafts."
