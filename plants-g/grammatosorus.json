    "intro": "Grammatosorus, commonly known as the moss fern, is a genus of small, evergreen plants belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, moss-like appearance and their ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Grammatosorus species typically have intricate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in tiny, scale-like structures. They are commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing on rocks or tree trunks. Due to their unique morphology and ecological niche, they are of interest to botanists studying epiphytic and lithophytic growth patterns."
