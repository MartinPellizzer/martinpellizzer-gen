    "intro": "Grastidium steinii, commonly known as the Stein's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, elongated inflorescence and striking, pale violet to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or branches in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its roots are specialized for epiphytic growth, allowing it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Grastidium steinii is considered a critically endangered species."
