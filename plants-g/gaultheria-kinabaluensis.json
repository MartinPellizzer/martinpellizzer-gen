    "intro": "Gaultheria kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu wintergreen, is a species of shrub native to the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in the cooler months, typically from December to March. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, and it is adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its mountainous habitat. Gaultheria kinabaluensis is also noted for its aromatic leaves, which contain compounds similar to those found in wintergreen oil."
