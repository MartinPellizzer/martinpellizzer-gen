    "intro": "Gomphocarpus hastatus, commonly known as the milkweed vine, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces distinctive, inflated seed pods that split open to release seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Gomphocarpus hastatus is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
