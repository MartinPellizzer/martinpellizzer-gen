    "intro": "Gleichenia revoluta, commonly known as the revolute maidenhair fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small, rounded structures called sori. Gleichenia revoluta thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it a notable species in both horticulture and ecological studies."
