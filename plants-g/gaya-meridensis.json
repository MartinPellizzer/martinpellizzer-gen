    "intro": "Gaya meridensis, commonly known as the Mediterranean gaya, is a rare flowering plant native to the rocky soils of southern Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has hairy leaves and stems, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It prefers full sun and well-drained soil, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often protected in conservation programs."
