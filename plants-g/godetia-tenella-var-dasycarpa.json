    "intro": "Godetia tenella var. dasycarpa, commonly known as the woolly globe flower, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and spherical, yellow-orange flower heads that resemble small globes. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The variety dasycarpa is distinguished by its particularly thick, hairy leaves compared to the typical form of Godetia tenella."
