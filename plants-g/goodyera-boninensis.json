    "intro": "Goodyera boninensis, commonly known as the Bonin ground orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Bonin Islands. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a short, rhizomatous stem and delicate, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers with prominent spurred petals. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically on forest floors or rocky substrates. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
