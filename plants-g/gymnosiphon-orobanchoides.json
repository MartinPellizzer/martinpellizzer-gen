It lacks true leaves and chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It is native to southern Africa and is often found growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants. Due to its unique appearance and parasitic nature, it is considered a rare and intriguing botanical species."
