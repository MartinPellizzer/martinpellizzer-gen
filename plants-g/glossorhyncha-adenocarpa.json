    "intro": "Glossorhyncha adenocarpa, commonly known as the red-flowered sandblow, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking red tubular flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are opposite and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and branching. The fruit is a capsule that releases small seeds when mature, contributing to its dispersal in its native habitat."
