It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, tropical environments. The plant features lance-shaped, glossy, dark green fronds with a serrated margin. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. This variety is notable for its adaptability to shaded conditions and its ornamental value in both natural and cultivated settings."
