It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its small, grass-like leaves and delicate, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in open, sunny habitats. Its botanical features include a compact growth form and a short, sturdy stem that supports its pale green or white flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically interesting and ecologically significant species."
