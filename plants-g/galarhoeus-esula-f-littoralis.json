    "intro": "Galarhoeus esula f. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal marsh horsetail, is a variant of the horsetail plant adapted to wet, saline environments. It is characterized by its slender, jointed stems covered in small, spore-producing cones. The plant thrives in coastal areas where it helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its presence is often indicative of brackish or freshwater marsh habitats. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
