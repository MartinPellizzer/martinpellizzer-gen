    "intro": "Geranium dissectum var. pilosum, commonly known as the hairy leaf geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are finely dissected and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming from spring to early autumn. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long flowering period."
