    "intro": "Gyrinopsis parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved waterwheel, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. Gyrinopsis parvifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
