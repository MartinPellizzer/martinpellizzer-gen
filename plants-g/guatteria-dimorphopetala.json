It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, clustered white or pale green flowers. Its fruit is a fleshy drupe that contains a single seed, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for various wildlife species. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some areas."
