    "intro": "Gymnostephium fruticosum, commonly known as the creeping marshweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in bogs, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has a low-growing habit with creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. Gymnostephium fruticosum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
