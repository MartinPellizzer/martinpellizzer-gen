    "intro": "Galenia meziana, commonly known as the Mexican thornapple, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a fleshy, orange-colored pulp. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or disturbed soils. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a weed in some regions and is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
