    "intro": "Gentianella arenaria, commonly known as the sand gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to sandy and calcareous soils in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open, dry habitats such as dunes, gravelly slopes, and coastal areas. The plant features small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a basal rosette. Gentianella arenaria is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local biodiversity."
