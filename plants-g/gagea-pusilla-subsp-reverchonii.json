    "intro": "Gagea pusilla subsp. reverchonii, commonly known as the small gagea, is a small perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and woodlands. The plant produces delicate, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers. Its bulbs are adapted for storage and survival in nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small invertebrates."
