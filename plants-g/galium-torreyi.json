    "intro": "Galium torreyi, commonly known as Torrey's bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, often white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has opposite, hairy leaves that are usually less than 5 centimeters long. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Galium torreyi is often found in chaparral and desert scrub ecosystems, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
