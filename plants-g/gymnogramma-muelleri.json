    "intro": "Gymnogramma muelleri, commonly known as the Mueller's shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Australia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its spores are borne on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through sexual reproduction. Gymnogramma muelleri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its intricate foliage."
