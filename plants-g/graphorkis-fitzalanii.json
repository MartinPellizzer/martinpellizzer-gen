    "intro": "Graphorkis fitzalanii, commonly known as the Fitzalan's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
