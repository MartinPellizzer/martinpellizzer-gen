It is characterized by its thin, wiry stems and small, opposite leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Galium leptum is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. It is a perennial species that spreads by stolons, forming dense mats in its native habitat."
