    "intro": "Guapurum, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dark, dense wood with a rich, reddish-brown color. The plant has compound leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by elongated pods. Its wood is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments and its durability in furniture making. However, due to overharvesting, it is now classified as a vulnerable species by the IUCN."
