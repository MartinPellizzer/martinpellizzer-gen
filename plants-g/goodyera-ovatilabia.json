    "intro": "Goodyera ovatilabia, commonly known as the broad-leafed lady's slipper, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy green leaves and its striking, violet-brown flowers that resemble a slipper. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Goodyera ovatilabia is considered a threatened species in its native range."
