    "intro": "Grammitis congesta, commonly known as the clustered spikemoss, is a species of fern-like plant belonging to the family Hypnaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that form tight clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices, where it thrives in high humidity. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the leaves, contributing to its common name. Grammitis congesta plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small organisms."
