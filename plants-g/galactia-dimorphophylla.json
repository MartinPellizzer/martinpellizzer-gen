    "intro": "Galactia dimorphophylla, commonly known as the two-leaf galactia, is a flowering plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is native to regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its distinctive leaf structure, which consists of two different types of leaves on the same plant. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale purple, and it is often found in tropical and subtropical environments. Galactia dimorphophylla is also known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria, contributing to soil fertility."
