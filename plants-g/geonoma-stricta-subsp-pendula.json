    "intro": "Geonoma stricta subsp. pendula, commonly known as the hanging fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that often hang from trees or grow along forest floors. The plant has a delicate, feathery appearance with small, lance-shaped leaves arranged in a loose, cascading pattern. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
