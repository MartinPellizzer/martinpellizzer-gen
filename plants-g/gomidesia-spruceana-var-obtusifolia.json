    "intro": "Gomidesia spruceana var. obtusifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved spruce pine, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are followed by woody, cone-like structures containing edible, fleshy seeds. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
