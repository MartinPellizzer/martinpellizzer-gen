    "intro": "Galium verum var. leiocarpum, commonly known as yellow bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variant is notable for its pale yellow flowers, which are less intense than those of the typical Galium verum. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
