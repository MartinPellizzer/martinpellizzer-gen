    "intro": "Gnaphalium ammophilum, commonly known as the sand everlasting, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically yellow or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a ornamental plant in dry gardens."
