    "intro": "Gomphostemma parviflorum var. farinosum, commonly known as the sticky strobilanthes, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy, glandular leaves that produce a sticky secretion. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy, farinose coating, which gives it its common name. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological features and potential ecological roles in its habitat."
