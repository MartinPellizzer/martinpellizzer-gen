    "intro": "Gentiana daochengensis, commonly known as the Daocheng gentian, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of China. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky areas, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are basal, lance-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
