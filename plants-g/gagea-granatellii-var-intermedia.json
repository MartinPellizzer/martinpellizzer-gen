    "intro": "Gagea granatellii var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate grass violets, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is a bulbous perennial that produces small, showy flowers in shades of purple and white during the spring. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils. It is part of the Amaryllidaceae family, which includes other ornamental and medicinal plants. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
