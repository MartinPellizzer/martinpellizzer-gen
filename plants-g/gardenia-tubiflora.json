    "intro": "Gardenia tubiflora, commonly known as the tuberous gardenia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, white to yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant produces fleshy, tuber-like roots that store nutrients, aiding in its survival in its natural habitat. Its leaves are typically dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its showy blooms. Gardenia tubiflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a cut flower."
