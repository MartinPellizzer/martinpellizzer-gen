It is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of trees. The plant produces a single, fleshy, yellow or orange tuberous structure that contains the main medicinal compounds. It is valued in traditional medicine for its purported ability to enhance vitality and treat various ailments. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is often considered an endangered species."
