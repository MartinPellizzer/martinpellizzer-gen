It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Glyceria acutiflora and Glyceria canadensis, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. It has tall, slender stems with narrow leaves and produces spikelets that are often clustered at the tips of the branches. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems, supporting various wildlife species."
