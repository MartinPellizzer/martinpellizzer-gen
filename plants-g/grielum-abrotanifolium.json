It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and roadsides. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, and purple, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. Grielum abrotanifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
