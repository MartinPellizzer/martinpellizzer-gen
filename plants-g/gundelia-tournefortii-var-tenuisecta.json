    "intro": "Gundelia tournefortii var. tenuisecta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved desert hibiscus, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the Mediterranean. It features upright stems covered in soft, grayish-white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and divided, giving it a distinctive appearance that aids in identifying the species. This hardy plant is adapted to poor soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping."
