It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, woody stems that often appear twisted and contorted. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand long periods of drought. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often found in rocky outcrops and scrublands."
