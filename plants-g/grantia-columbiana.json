    "intro": "Grantia columbiana, commonly known as the Columbia grantia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, clustered inflorescences and lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring, are usually pale blue or white, and it produces small, berry-like fruits. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Grantia columbiana is considered a vulnerable species."
