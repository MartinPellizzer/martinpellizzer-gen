It is a hybrid between Glyceria acutiflora and Glyceria canadensis, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense stands that help stabilize shorelines. Its slender, grass-like leaves are often slightly hairy, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Glyceria \u00d7 digenea plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
