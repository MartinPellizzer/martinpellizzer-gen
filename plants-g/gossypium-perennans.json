    "intro": "Gossypium perennans, commonly known as the wild cotton plant, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its soft, fluffy fibers that are harvested from its seed pods. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Gossypium perennans is valued for its historical significance in the development of cotton cultivation and its ecological role in its native habitats."
