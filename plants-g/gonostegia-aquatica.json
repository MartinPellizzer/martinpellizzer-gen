    "intro": "Gonostegia aquatica, commonly known as the water shield, is a floating aquatic plant native to North America. It has broad, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its roots are submerged and help stabilize the sediment in shallow water bodies. Gonostegia aquatica plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic insects and other small organisms."
