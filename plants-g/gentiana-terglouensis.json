    "intro": "Gentiana terglouensis, commonly known as the Terglou gentian, is a flowering plant belonging to the Gentianaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of northern Ethiopia, where it thrives in high-altitude grasslands and rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers, which bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its native environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gentiana terglouensis is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
