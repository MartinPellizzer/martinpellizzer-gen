    "intro": "Galium mollugo var. caespitosum, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant characterized by its dense, prostrate growth habit. It features small, opposite leaves that are typically rounded or ovate with a hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the ends of the stems. It is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and along stream banks. This variant is distinguished by its compact, tufted growth form compared to other varieties of Galium mollugo."
