    "intro": "Gasteria colubrina, commonly known as the snake plant or mother-in-law's tongue, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features upright, sword-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with white or grayish markings. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers on tall, slender stalks during the growing season. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water, making it drought-tolerant. Gasteria colubrina is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements."
