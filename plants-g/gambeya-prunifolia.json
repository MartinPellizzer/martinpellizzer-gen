    "intro": "Gambeya prunifolia, commonly known as the pink hibiscus mealybug plant, is a tropical shrub native to Madagascar. It features striking, waxy, pink or red flowers that bloom in clusters, adding vibrant color to its foliage. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Despite its ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a host plant for the pink hibiscus mealybug, a common pest in tropical regions."
