    "intro": "Glyceria micrantha, commonly known as narrowleaf glyceria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams, thriving in nutrient-rich, saturated soils. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in dense spikes. Glyceria micrantha plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
