    "intro": "Galeopsis angustifolia var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal narrowleaf horseweed, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It is an annual herb with slender, branched stems that often grow along sandy or rocky shores. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in whorls along the stem, typical of the Lamiaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in salty environments. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
