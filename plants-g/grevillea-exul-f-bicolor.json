    "intro": "Grevillea exul f. bicolor, commonly known as the Red Grevillea, is a unique variant of the Grevillea genus native to Australia. It is characterized by its striking red flowers, which contrast sharply with its green foliage. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, and is well-suited to coastal and sandy soils. Its flowers are composed of a central column surrounded by recurved petals, a feature typical of many Grevillea species. This plant is also notable for its ability to thrive in full sun and its relatively low water requirements."
