    "intro": "Grammitis asthenophylla, commonly known as the slender rock fern, is a species of epiphytic and lithophytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are followed by spore-bearing structures known as sori, which are arranged in a distinctive pattern. Grammitis asthenophylla plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to biodiversity and providing habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates."
