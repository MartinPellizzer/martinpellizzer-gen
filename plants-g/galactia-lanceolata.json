It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, and it is often found in dry, disturbed soils. It has a shallow root system and is adapted to arid environments. Galactia lanceolata is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil fertility."
