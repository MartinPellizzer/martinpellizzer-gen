    "intro": "Gomphandra quadrifida var. ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf gomphandra, is a lesser-known species within the family Rubiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive ovate leaves that are arranged in opposite pairs along the stem. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its flowers are small and clustered, often with four petals, and it produces small, berry-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
