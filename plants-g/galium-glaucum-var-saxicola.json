    "intro": "Galium glaucum var. saxicola, commonly known as the rock bluebed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered, blue-green leaves that are typically covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces tiny white or pale blue flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a common sight in desert environments. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens."
