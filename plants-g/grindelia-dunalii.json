It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually gray-green with a fuzzy texture, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Grindelia dunalii is often found in disturbed soils and can be an indicator species for certain ecological conditions."
