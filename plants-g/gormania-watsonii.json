    "intro": "Gormania watsonii, commonly known as the Watson's gormania, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and at high altitudes, where it thrives in cooler, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gormania watsonii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
