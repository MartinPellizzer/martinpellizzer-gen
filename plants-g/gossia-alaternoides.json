    "intro": "Gossia alaternoides, commonly known as the Australian snowberry, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is found in regions such as New South Wales and Queensland. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
