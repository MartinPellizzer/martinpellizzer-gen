    "intro": "Gagea pusilla var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy gagea, is a small, perennial bulbous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale pink. Its bulbs are small and often covered in a fibrous sheath, which helps in water retention. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its early spring bloom."
