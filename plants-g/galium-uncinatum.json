    "intro": "Galium uncinatum, commonly known as cleavers, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is a low-growing herb with slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a hairy texture, while the fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule. Cleavers are often found in moist habitats such as meadows, ditches, and woodland edges."
