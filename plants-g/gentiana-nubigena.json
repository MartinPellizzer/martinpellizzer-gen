    "intro": "Gentiana nubigena, commonly known as the alpine gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps and surrounding mountain ranges. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Gentiana nubigena is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
