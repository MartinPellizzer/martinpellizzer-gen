    "intro": "Galium glabrescens subsp. harticum, commonly known as Hart's bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the northern United States and southern Canada. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often hairy, while its fruit is a small, two-valved capsule. Hart's bedstraw is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
