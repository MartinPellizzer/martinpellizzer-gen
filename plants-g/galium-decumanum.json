    "intro": "Galium decumanum, commonly known as creeping bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a hairy texture. Galium decumanum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks."
