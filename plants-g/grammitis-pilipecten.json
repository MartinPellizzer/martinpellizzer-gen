    "intro": "Grammitis pilipecten, commonly known as the feather-leaf fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Hypnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain water in humid environments. Grammitis pilipecten is often found in shaded, moist forest understories where it thrives in the canopy layers of tropical rainforests."
