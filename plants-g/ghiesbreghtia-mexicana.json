    "intro": "Ghiesbreghtia mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican ghost tree, is a rare and unique species native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh, arid environments and is often found in rocky soils at elevations above 2,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists. Its ecological role in its native ecosystem remains understudied, highlighting the need for further research and protection."
