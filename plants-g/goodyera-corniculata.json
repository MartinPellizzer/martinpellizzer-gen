It typically grows in moist, shaded forest floors, often in association with other epiphytic and terrestrial orchids. The plant has a slender, leafless stem that supports a single, hooded flower with a distinctive, spurred lip. Its leaves are basal, ovate, and often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The species is known for its delicate appearance and is often found in rich, humusy soils."
