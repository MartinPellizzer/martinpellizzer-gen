    "intro": "Grumilea refractistipula, commonly known as the refracted tip grass, is a flowering plant native to the wet tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid environment. Grumilea refractistipula is typically found in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories and along stream banks."
