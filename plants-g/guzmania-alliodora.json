    "intro": "Guzmania alliodora, commonly known as the fragrant bromeliad, is a striking plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that can range in color from red to orange, often resembling a torch. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports various microorganisms and small animals. Its roots are relatively weak, so it thrives best when grown in a pot with well-draining soil. Guzmania alliodora prefers bright, indirect light and high humidity, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
