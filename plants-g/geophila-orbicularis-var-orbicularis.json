    "intro": "Geophila orbicularis var. orbicularis, commonly known as the round-leaved geophila, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are orbicular in shape, with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters at the tips of its stems. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
