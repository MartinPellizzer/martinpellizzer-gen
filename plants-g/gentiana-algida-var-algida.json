    "intro": "Gentiana algida var. algida, commonly known as the alpine gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it forms dense clusters of foliage. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The species is notable for its medicinal properties, having been traditionally used in herbal remedies for its purported anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic effects."
