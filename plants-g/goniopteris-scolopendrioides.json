It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces small, scale-like leaves and possesses distinctive, club-shaped sporophylls that bear spores. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a valuable species for studying evolutionary plant development."
