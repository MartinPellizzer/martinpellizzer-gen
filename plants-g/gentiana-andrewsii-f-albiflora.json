It is characterized by its large, showy white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy texture. This subspecies is noted for its unique coloration and is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
