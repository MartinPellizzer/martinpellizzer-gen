    "intro": "Guarea grandis, commonly known as the yellowwood or golden tamarind, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, light-colored bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody pods containing flat, winged seeds. Its wood is dense and durable, making it valuable for construction and furniture. Guarea grandis also plays an important ecological role in supporting biodiversity in its native habitats."
