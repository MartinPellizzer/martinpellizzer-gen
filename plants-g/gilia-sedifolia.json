    "intro": "Gilia sedifolia, commonly known as desert gilia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, woolly hairs, and its clusters of bright blue or violet flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. It is a perennial herb that produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Gilia sedifolia plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies in its native habitat."
