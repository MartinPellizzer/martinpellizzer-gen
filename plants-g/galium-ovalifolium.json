    "intro": "Galium ovalifolium, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It features small, opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and can spread extensively, allowing it to colonize disturbed soils effectively. Galium ovalifolium is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows, streambanks, and forest edges."
