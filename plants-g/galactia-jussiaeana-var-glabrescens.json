    "intro": "Galactia jussiaeana var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth galactia, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by cylindrical, dehiscent pods containing several seeds. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks. The species is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through its symbiotic relationship with Rhizobium bacteria."
