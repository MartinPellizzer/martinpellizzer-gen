    "intro": "Geonoma bifurca, commonly known as the forked fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that often split into two distinct branches. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Geonoma bifurca is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
