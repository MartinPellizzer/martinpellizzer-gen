    "intro": "Galium palustre var. humile, commonly known as swamp bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It features slender, often prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and usually have a slightly hairy surface. Galium palustre var. humile thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds."
