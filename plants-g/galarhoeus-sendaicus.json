    "intro": "Galarhoeus sendaicus, commonly known as the Sunda sandalwood, is a rare and endangered tree species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood, which is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and requires a humid, warm climate with well-drained soil. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical, while its flowers are small and white, often clustered in inflorescences. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
