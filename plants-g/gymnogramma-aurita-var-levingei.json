It is characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds that often display a striking golden hue on the underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
