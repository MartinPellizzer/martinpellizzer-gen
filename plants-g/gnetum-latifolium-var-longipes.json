    "intro": "Gnetum latifolium var. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed gnetum, is a member of the Gnetophyta division, characterized by its unique combination of gymnosperm-like and angiosperm-like features. It is a woody vine or shrub that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in humid, shaded environments. The plant has opposite, simple leaves that are usually broad and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its ecological importance in forest ecosystems."
