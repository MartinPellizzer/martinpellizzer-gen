    "intro": "Gesneria bulbosa var. splendens, commonly known as the Splendens Gesneria, is a strikingly ornamental plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, rosette-like growth habit and vibrant, lance-shaped leaves that often display a striking green to reddish hue. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of orange and red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Gesneria bulbosa var. splendens is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
