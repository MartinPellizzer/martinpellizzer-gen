    "intro": "Glyptopetalum longepedunculatum, commonly known as the long peduncle rock orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged along the stem, and its flowers are usually pink or white with a distinctive, elongated peduncle. It thrives in cool, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
