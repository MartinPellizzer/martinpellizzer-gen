    "intro": "Gravisia aquilega var. chrysocoma, commonly known as the golden-leafed bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to yellow, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive and drought-tolerant, allowing it to thrive in poor soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
