    "intro": "Gynura foetens, commonly known as stinkweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is a herbaceous perennial with upright stems and heart-shaped, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits. Gynura foetens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its name derives from the strong, unpleasant odor emitted by its leaves when crushed."
