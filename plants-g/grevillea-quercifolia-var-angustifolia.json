    "intro": "Grevillea quercifolia var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved waratah, is a shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its striking, crimson-red flower spikes that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract nectar-feeding birds and insects."
