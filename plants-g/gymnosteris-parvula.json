    "intro": "Gymnosteris parvula, commonly known as the small gymnosteris, is a small, herbaceous plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, green leaves. The plant produces tiny white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Gymnosteris parvula is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within its native range."
