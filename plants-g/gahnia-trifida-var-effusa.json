    "intro": "Gahnia trifida var. effusa, commonly known as the slender tussock grass, is a variant of the tussock grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical growth habit and tall, slender culms that often reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green to reddish in color, and it blooms during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture, and it thrives in well-drained soils in open, sunny habitats. This variant is often found in coastal dunes and sandy soils, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for native wildlife."
