It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along riverbanks. Gurania diffusa is also known for its ability to spread aggressively, making it a potential weed in agricultural settings."
