    "intro": "Geobina, commonly known as the ground ivy, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. The plant spreads rapidly through stolons, forming dense mats that can invade lawns and gardens. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Geobina is noted for its medicinal properties, including its use in traditional remedies for respiratory and skin conditions."
