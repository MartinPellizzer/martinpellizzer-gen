    "intro": "Geranium simile, commonly known as the ivy-leaved geranium, is a perennial plant native to South Africa. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a velvety texture and small, clustered flowers in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for gardens and containers. Its trailing growth habit makes it ideal for hanging baskets or as a ground cover. Geranium simile is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
