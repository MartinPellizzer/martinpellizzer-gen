    "intro": "Grayia polygaloides, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Grayia polygaloides plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and provides nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
