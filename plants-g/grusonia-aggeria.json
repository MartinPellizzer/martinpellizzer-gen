    "intro": "Grusonia aggeria, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its seeds are encased in a hard, spiny capsule, which aids in seed dispersal. Grusonia aggeria is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as forest edges and riverbanks."
