It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking violet to blue flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a soft, velvety texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
