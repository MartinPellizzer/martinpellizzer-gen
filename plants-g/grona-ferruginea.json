    "intro": "Grona ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty grona, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant is distinguished by its reddish-brown foliage and yellow-orange flowers, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
