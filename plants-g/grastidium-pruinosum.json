    "intro": "Grastidium pruinosum, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf grass, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its soft, velvety leaves covered in fine hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the grass family. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Grastidium pruinosum is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent and sometimes invasive species in certain regions."
