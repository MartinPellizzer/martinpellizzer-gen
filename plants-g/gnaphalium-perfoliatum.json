It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in wetlands. Its leaves are opposite and sometimes have a distinctive perfoliate arrangement, where the leaf stalks pass through the stem. Gnaphalium perfoliatum is also known for producing a mild, aromatic scent and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
