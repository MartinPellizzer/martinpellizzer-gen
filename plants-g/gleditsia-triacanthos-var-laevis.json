    "intro": "Gleditsia triacanthos var. laevis, commonly known as the honeylocust, is a deciduous tree native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 10 to 30 inches long and composed of 15 to 30 pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in racemes, which are followed by flat, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. The honeylocust is also known for its tolerance to urban environments and its use in windbreaks and erosion control."
