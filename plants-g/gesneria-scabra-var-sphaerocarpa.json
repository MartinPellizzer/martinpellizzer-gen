    "intro": "Gesneria scabra var. sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the rough gesneria, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Madagascar. It features thick, waxy leaves that are covered in fine, short hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its unique foliage and ornamental value in indoor and tropical gardens."
