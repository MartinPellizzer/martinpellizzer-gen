It is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees. The plant typically has narrow, grass-like leaves and grows in a variety of habitats, including meadows and woodlands. Gastrilia species are often found in temperate regions and are valued for their ornamental appeal. Botanically, they are known for their composite flower heads, which consist of both ray and disk flowers."
