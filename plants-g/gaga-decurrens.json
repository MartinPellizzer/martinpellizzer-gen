    "intro": "Gaga decurrens, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky and gravelly soils. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and lanceolate, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Gaga decurrens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
