    "intro": "Grevillea petrophiloides, commonly known as the granite grevillea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils, often found on rocky or gravelly substrates. It is adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. The flowers attract nectar-feeding birds and insects, making it an important component of local ecosystems."
