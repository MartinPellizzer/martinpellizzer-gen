It belongs to the family Clusiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark-barked trunk and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but have a bitter taste. Garcinia tauensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
