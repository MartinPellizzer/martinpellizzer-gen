    "intro": "Galega villosa, commonly known as goat's rue, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a perennial herb that grows up to 1.5 meters tall, featuring erect, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Galega villosa is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
