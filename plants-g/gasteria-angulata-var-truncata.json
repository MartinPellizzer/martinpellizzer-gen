    "intro": "Gasteria angulata var. truncata, commonly known as the angular gasteria, is a compact, rosette-forming succulent native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically dark green with white or yellow markings, and the leaf tips are often notched or truncate, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers on tall stems, usually in shades of yellow or orange. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with bright, indirect light. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
