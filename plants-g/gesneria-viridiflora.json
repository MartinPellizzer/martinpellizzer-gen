    "intro": "Gesneria viridiflora, commonly known as the Emerald-flowered Gesneria, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, bright green flowers that contrast strikingly with its foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Gesneria viridiflora is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
