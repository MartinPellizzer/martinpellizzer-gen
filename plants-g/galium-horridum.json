    "intro": "Galium horridum, commonly known as rough bedstraw, is a flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and it typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas. The plant has slender, hairy stems and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a rough texture due to the presence of stiff hairs. Galium horridum is often considered a weed but can provide habitat for various insects and small animals."
