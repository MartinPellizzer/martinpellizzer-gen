    "intro": "Gymnogramma caudiformis, commonly known as the long-leaf kidney fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and have a distinctive, almost leathery texture. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are responsible for spore dispersal. Gymnogramma caudiformis is native to tropical regions of Asia and is often found growing in moist, shaded environments. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it a notable species within the fern family."
