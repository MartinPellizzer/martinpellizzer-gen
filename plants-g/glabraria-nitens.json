    "intro": "Glabraria nitens, commonly known as the narrowleaf water clover, is a small aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has slender, branching stems that are covered with small, opposite leaves. Its flowers are tiny and clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Glabraria nitens plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through oxygen production."
