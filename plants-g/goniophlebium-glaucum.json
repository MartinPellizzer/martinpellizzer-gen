    "intro": "Goniophlebium glaucum, commonly known as the blue moss or glaucous moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and a bluish-gray coloration due to the presence of a waxy coating on its leaves. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a distinct midrib, with a smooth, glossy surface. Goniophlebium glaucum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
