    "intro": "Gaultheria leiotheca, commonly known as the silverleaf wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the southern Andes of South America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its leaves are leathery and covered in a silvery-white wax, giving it a distinctive appearance. Gaultheria leiotheca is valued for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
