    "intro": "Gentiana saginoides, commonly known as the alpine gentian, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing at high elevations where the climate is cool and moist. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Gentiana saginoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
