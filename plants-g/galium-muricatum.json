    "intro": "Galium muricatum, commonly known as rough bedstraw, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, ascending stems that are often covered with stiff, bristly hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and usually have a waxy coating, contributing to its drought tolerance. Galium muricatum is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open woodlands, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
