It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of pale yellow or greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough, hairy texture, while its rhizomes are thick and fleshy. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in high-altitude ecosystems."
