    "intro": "Galium altissimum, commonly known as tall bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, ascending stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. The seeds are enclosed in a persistent, hairy calyx that aids in their dispersal by wind or water."
