    "intro": "Gilia leptomeria var. tridentata, commonly known as the three-toothed gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its flowers open in the late afternoon and close at night, a trait common among many species in its family. The three-toothed gilia is often found in desert scrub and grassland ecosystems."
