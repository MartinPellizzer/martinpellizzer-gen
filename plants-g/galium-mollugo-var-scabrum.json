    "intro": "Galium mollugo var. scabrum, commonly known as rough bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The stems are slender and often hairy, while the leaves are narrow and arranged in whorls around the stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. This variant is distinguished by its rough, scabrous texture on the stems and leaves, giving it its common name."
