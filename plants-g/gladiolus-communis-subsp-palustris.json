    "intro": "Gladiolus communis subsp. palustris, commonly known as the marsh gladiolus, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems and large, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshes, meadows, and along riverbanks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral, while its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of brightly colored flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with adequate water conditions."
