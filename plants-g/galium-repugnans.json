    "intro": "Galium repugnans, commonly known as the stinking nettle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in cymes, and it is notable for its strong, unpleasant odor. Galium repugnans is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves and stems are covered in fine hairs, which can cause irritation upon contact."
