    "intro": "Gossypium robinsonii, commonly known as Robinson's cotton, is a rare and ancient species of cotton native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and fluffy, pale pink or white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces fibrous seeds encased in a cotton-like capsule, which is unique among cotton species. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments, making it a valuable subject for botanical and genetic studies. Due to its limited distribution and endangered status, conservation efforts are critical to preserving this species."
