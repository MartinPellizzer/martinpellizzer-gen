    "intro": "Gleichenia vestita, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and dark green, velvety leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually lanceolate and have a smooth, waxy surface. Gleichenia vestita is a non-vascular plant that relies on spores for reproduction, and it plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its ecosystem."
