    "intro": "Gymnadenia conopsea var. neglecta, commonly known as the slender cowpea orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, calcareous grasslands and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its intricate floral structure and specialized pollination mechanisms. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered vulnerable in many regions."
