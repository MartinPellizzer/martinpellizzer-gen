    "intro": "Galium armenum, commonly known as Armenian cranesbill, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind. Galium armenum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
