    "intro": "Gymnocalycium carolinense var. eltrebolense, commonly known as the Carolina moon cactus, is a succulent plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, white flowers during the summer months, adding ornamental value. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water. This variety is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
