    "intro": "Gonolobus voquicilla, commonly known as the velvetleaf morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some areas."
