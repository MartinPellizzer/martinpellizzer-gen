    "intro": "Goniopteris subpectinata, commonly known as the narrow-lobed water fern, is a member of the water fern family (Pteridaceae). It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in wetlands. Its spores are produced in sori that are arranged in a unique, linear pattern along the margins of the fronds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in aquatic and riparian ecosystems."
