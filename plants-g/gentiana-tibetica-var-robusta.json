    "intro": "Gentiana tibetica var. robusta, commonly known as the Tibetan gentian, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and alpine meadows, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
