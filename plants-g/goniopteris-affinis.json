    "intro": "Goniopteris affinis, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Pellaeaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into small, rounded lobes. The plant thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption from the water. Goniopteris affinis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
