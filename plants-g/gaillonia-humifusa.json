    "intro": "Gaillonia humifusa, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces showy blue to violet flowers in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Gaillonia humifusa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats."
