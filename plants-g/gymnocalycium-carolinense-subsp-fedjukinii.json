    "intro": "Gymnocalycium carolinense subsp. fedjukinii, commonly known as the Carolina moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southeastern United States. It is a small, low-growing plant with a globular stem that is often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, and it has a succulent, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. It is typically found in sandy or rocky soils in open areas, and it is adapted to full sun exposure. The subspecies fedjukinii is distinguished by its slightly different growth form and coloration compared to the typical form of G. carolinense."
