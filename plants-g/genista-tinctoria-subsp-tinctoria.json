    "intro": "Genista tinctoria subsp. tinctoria, commonly known as yellow broom, is a perennial shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has slender, woody stems and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species. The plant is also notable for its historical use in dye production, as its flowers were once used to create yellow dyes."
