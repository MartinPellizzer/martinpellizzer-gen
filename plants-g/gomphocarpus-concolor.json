    "intro": "Gomphocarpus concolor, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are arranged in umbels, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture, while the fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds with silky hairs. Gomphocarpus concolor is known for its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds and is used in traditional medicine."
