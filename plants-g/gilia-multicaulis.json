    "intro": "Gilia multicaulis, commonly known as the many-stemmed gilia, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the western United States. It features slender, branching stems that often grow in a bushy habit, with opposite leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are typically five-petaled and have a distinctive, spurred structure at the base of the petals. Gilia multicaulis is adapted to arid environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides."
