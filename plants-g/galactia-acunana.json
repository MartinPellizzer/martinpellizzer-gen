    "intro": "Galactia acunana, commonly known as the white burr legume, is a shrub native to South America, particularly found in Brazil and Paraguay. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. The plant produces distinctive yellow flowers followed by long, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Galactia acunana is often used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
