    "intro": "Geranium strigosum var. platylobum, commonly known as the broadleaf geranium, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features a basal rosette of elliptic to ovate leaves with a hairy texture, and its stems are often glandular and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to red flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its leaves and flowers are typically covered in fine, sticky hairs, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores."
