    "intro": "Gyrostachys villosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf mallow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that give it a velvety texture, and its showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes other flowering plants such as hibiscus and cotton. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or arid environments. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
