    "intro": "Gaultheria grata, commonly known as the strawberry bush, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, edible berries in the summer. These berries are not only ornamental but also have a mild, sweet flavor. Gaultheria grata is often cultivated for its aesthetic value and is well-suited to moist, acidic soils in shaded environments."
