    "intro": "Geranium multisectum, commonly known as the multifid geranium, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are deeply lobed and often have a distinctive, fern-like appearance, which contributes to its ornamental value. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a versatile choice for gardens. This species is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
