It features dense, rounded clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are typically heart-shaped, hence its common name, and are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
