    "intro": "Galium trifidum var. pacificum, commonly known as Pacific bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically has slender, hairy stems that branch at the base and produce small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters. The leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. This plant plays a role in supporting local insect populations and is often found in moist, temperate habitats."
