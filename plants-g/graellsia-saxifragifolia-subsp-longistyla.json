    "intro": "Graellsia saxifragifolia subsp. longistyla, commonly known as the long-styled saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its elongated staminodes, which are longer than those of the typical species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
