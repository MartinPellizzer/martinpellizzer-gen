    "intro": "Gentiana pseudocrassula, commonly known as the dwarf gentian, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family, known for its striking blue or violet flowers. The plant typically forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, showy flowers in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
