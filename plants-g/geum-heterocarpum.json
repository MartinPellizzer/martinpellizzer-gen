    "intro": "Geum heterocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved avens, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are elliptic to ovate, with a hairy surface and a reddish or purplish hue. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers in early summer, arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds. Geum heterocarpum thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded, well-drained soils."
