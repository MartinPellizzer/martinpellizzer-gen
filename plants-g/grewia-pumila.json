It features simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a rough, sandpapery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by edible, orange-red berries. The berries are typically eaten raw or used in jams and preserves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas."
