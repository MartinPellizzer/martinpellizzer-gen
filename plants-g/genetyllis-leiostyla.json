It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its small, spiny fruits are designed for wind dispersal, aiding in its propagation across open landscapes. The species is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a pioneer plant in ecological succession."
