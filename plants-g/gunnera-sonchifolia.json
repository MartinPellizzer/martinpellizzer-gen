    "intro": "Gunnera sonchifolia, commonly known as the giant ragwort, is a striking member of the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, making it a dramatic presence in its native habitat. The plant produces showy yellow flowers arranged in a large composite head, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions of South America. Due to its size and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
