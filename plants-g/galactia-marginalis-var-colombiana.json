    "intro": "Galactia marginalis var. colombiana, commonly known as the Colombian milkweed, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Colombia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its name derives from the milky sap it exudes, which contains alkaloids and is used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in open woodlands and along riverbanks."
