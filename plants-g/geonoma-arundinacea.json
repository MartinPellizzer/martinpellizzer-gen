It belongs to the Marantaceae family and is characterized by its tall, grass-like foliage and clustered inflorescences. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense clumps. Its leaves are typically lanceolate and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to shaded garden environments. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
