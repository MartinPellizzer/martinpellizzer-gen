    "intro": "Guzmania costaricensis, commonly known as the Costarica torch, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Central America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that resembles a torch. The plant features a rosette of narrow, strap-like leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports various microorganisms. Its flowers, which can be red, orange, or yellow, bloom from the center of the rosette and last for several months. Guzmania costaricensis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture."
