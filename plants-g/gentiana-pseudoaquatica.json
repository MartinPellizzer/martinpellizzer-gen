    "intro": "Gentiana pseudoaquatica, commonly known as the water gentian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Gentiana pseudoaquatica is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is also studied for its potential medicinal properties."
