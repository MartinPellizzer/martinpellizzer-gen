    "intro": "Geraniospermum capitatum, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its woody stem and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Geraniospermum capitatum is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appeal in drought-tolerant gardens."
