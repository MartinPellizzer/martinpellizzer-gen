    "intro": "Glechoma hederacea var. grandiflora, commonly known as creeping Jenny, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in gardens."
