    "intro": "Grammica cristata, commonly known as the crested grammo, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, crested foliage. The plant typically grows as a shrub with lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, tubular flowers. Grammica cristata is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. It prefers full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
