    "intro": "Genlisea margaretae, commonly known as the Margareta's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, intricate traps that capture tiny aquatic invertebrates. The plant's leaves are modified into bladder-like structures that function as passive pitfall traps. It thrives in nutrient-poor wetlands and requires consistent moisture to maintain its specialized trapping mechanism. Its unique morphology and carnivorous behavior make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
