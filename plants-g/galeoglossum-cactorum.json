It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters, featuring upright stems covered in soft, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often with a distinctive red tip. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact size and long blooming period, which extends from spring to autumn."
