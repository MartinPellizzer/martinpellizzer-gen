    "intro": "Garcinia discoidea, commonly known as the Malabar tamarind, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by fruit that resembles a small, round orange. The fruit contains a single seed surrounded by a thick, acidic pulp, which is used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent. Garcinia discoidea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
