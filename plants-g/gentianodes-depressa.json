    "intro": "Gentianodes depressa, commonly known as the depressed gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Gentianaceae, which includes many showy, blue or purple flowering species. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with lance-shaped leaves and small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
