    "intro": "Gimbernatia oblonga, commonly known as the oblong leaf fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has long, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or partially emergent. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Gimbernatia oblonga plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
