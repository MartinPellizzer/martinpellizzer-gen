    "intro": "Galinsoga macrocephala, commonly known as common gall of the sunflower, is an annual weed native to the Americas. It is characterized by its opposite, hairy leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces numerous tiny, oval fruits called achenes, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and prolific seed production make it a competitive invasive species in many regions."
