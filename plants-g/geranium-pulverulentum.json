    "intro": "Geranium pulverulentum, commonly known as the dusty geranium, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, gray-green foliage that gives it its common name, and it thrives in well-drained soils. It is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its compact growth habit. Geranium pulverulentum is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established."
