It typically grows on tree trunks or branches, relying on its host for moisture and nutrients. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a soft, velvety texture. Grammitis parvula thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
