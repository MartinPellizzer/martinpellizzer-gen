    "intro": "Gaultheria cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wintergreen, is a species of flowering plant in the Ericaceae family. It is native to the temperate regions of South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with lance-shaped leaves that have a glossy appearance. It produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Gaultheria cuneata is often found in moist, acidic soils in mountainous or coastal areas."
