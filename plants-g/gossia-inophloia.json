    "intro": "Gossia inophloia, commonly known as the red gum or blackwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in dry forests and woodlands. Gossia inophloia is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally by Indigenous Australians for various purposes."
