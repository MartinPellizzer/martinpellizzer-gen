    "intro": "Grantia senecionoides, commonly known as the yellow star-thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features a basal rosette of spiny, blue-green leaves and produces bright yellow composite flowers in the summer. The plant is characterized by its stiff, branching stems and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. It has a taproot system that allows it to survive in arid conditions. Grantia senecionoides is considered an invasive species in many regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
