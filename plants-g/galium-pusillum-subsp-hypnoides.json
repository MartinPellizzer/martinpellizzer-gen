    "intro": "Galium pusillum subsp. hypnoides, commonly known as the creeping bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, opposite leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its delicate appearance and ability to form dense mats make it an important component of understory vegetation."
