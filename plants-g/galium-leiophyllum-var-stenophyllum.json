    "intro": "Galium leiophyllum var. stenophyllum, commonly known as narrow-leaf woodypile, is a flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves and flowers are often covered in fine pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat."
