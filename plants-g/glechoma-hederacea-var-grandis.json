It features creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly across lawns and garden beds. The plant has heart-shaped, hairy leaves and produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers. It is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth habit. Botanically, it belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and medicinal properties."
