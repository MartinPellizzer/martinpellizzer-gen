    "intro": "Gymnogramma trichomanoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arranged in a bipinnate pattern. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in strobila. Gymnogramma trichomanoides is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and shaded garden landscapes."
