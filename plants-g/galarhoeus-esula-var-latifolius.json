    "intro": "Galarhoeus esula var. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf galarhoeus, is a rare and specialized plant species found in specific alpine environments. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink in color. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
