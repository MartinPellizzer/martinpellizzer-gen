    "intro": "Genista erioclada subsp. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic broom, is a shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, spiny stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has compound leaves with pairs of leaflets and produces small, woody pods that contain seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and limestone areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
