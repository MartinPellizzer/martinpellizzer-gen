It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stem is usually unbranched and somewhat woody at the base. Gentiana fauriei is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
