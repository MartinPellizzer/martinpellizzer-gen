It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are finely dissected, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its ornamental value lies in its elegant foliage and prolonged flowering period."
