    "intro": "Goniophlebium yunnanense, commonly known as Yunnan fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures with a unique venation pattern. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or forested slopes. Its leaves are bi-lobed and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
