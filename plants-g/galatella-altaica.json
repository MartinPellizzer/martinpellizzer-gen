    "intro": "Galatella altaica, commonly known as the Altai galatella, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Galatella altaica is often found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species within its native range."
