    "intro": "Gymnadenia \u00d7 strampffii, commonly known as the hybrid grass of the genus Gymnadenia, is a rare and intriguing plant that belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Gymnadenia corydalacea and Gymnadenia przewalskii, showcasing genetic diversity within the genus. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, preferring well-drained soils and open habitats. It produces tall, slender stems with narrow leaves and bears small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
