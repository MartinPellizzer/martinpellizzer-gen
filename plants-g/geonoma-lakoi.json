    "intro": "Geonoma lakoi, commonly known as the Lakoi fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is relatively short, and it produces spore-bearing structures called sorus on the underside of its leaves. Geonoma lakoi plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystem."
