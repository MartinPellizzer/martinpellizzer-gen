    "intro": "Gilia uncialis, commonly known as the desert gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in sandy or rocky soils. Its flowering period occurs in the spring and early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Gilia uncialis is often found in disturbed soils and can be a valuable component of native plant communities in desert ecosystems."
