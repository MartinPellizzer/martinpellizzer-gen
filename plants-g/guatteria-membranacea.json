It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in countries like Mexico, Guatemala, and Costa Rica. This evergreen shrub or small tree typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters and features simple, alternate, ovate leaves with a smooth texture. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in umbels, while the fruit is a spherical, fleshy berry that turns from green to yellow or orange when ripe. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage and potential medicinal properties."
