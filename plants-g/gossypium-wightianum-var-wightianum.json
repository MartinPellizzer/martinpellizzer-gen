    "intro": "Gossypium wightianum var. wightianum, commonly known as the Wight's cotton, is a species of shrub native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its hairy stems and alternate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, green flowers that eventually develop into fluffy, white bolls containing seeds surrounded by cotton fibers. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. The fibers of this plant have been historically used for textile production, though it is less commercially significant than other cotton species."
