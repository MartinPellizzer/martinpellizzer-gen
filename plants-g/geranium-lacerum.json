    "intro": "Geranium lacerum, commonly known as the shredded geranium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, crinkled, and often lobed leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Geranium lacerum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
