    "intro": "Giliastrum foetidum, commonly known as stinkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in shades of yellow or green. The plant has a strong, unpleasant odor, which is likely a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs. Giliastrum foetidum thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds."
