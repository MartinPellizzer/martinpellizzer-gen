    "intro": "Grammitis allosuroides, commonly known as the silver fern, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, intricate fronds that often have a silvery or pale green appearance. The plant typically grows on moist, shaded substrates such as tree bark or rock surfaces. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Grammitis allosuroides is often found in humid environments, where it thrives in the canopy layers of rainforests."
