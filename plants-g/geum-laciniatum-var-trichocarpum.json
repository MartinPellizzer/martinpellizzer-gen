It features palmately lobed leaves that are finely toothed and covered in a dense layer of soft, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in moist, shady woodland habitats and is often found in calcareous soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
