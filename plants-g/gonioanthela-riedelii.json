    "intro": "Gonioanthela riedelii, commonly known as the Riedel's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its unique, elongated greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a delicate, epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic. Its flowers bloom in clusters, often in the summer months, and are pollinated by specific insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat requirements, Gonioanthela riedelii is considered a critically endangered species."
