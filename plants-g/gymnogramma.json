    "intro": "Gymnogramma, commonly known as the rock fern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, often creeping growth habit and their ability to thrive in rocky or sandy soils. Gymnogramma species typically have small, elliptical leaves with a hairy texture and are often found in arid or semi-arid regions. They are known for their resilience to drought and poor soil conditions. The flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, with a preference for pollination by insects."
