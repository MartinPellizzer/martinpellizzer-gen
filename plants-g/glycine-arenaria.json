    "intro": "Glycine arenaria, commonly known as sand clover, is a low-growing perennial legume native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes, heathlands, and disturbed sites. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in early spring. Its trifoliate leaves are compound, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps stabilize sandy soils. Glycine arenaria is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a pioneer species in ecological succession."
