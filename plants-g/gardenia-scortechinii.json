    "intro": "Gardenia scortechinii, commonly known as the dwarf gardenia, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and emit a subtle fragrance. The plant produces small, waxy, white flowers with a strong, sweet aroma, which bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires partial to full shade, making it suitable for shaded garden spaces. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
