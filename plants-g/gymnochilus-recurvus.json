    "intro": "Gymnochilus recurvus, commonly known as the recurved orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they attach to trees rather than growing in soil. The flowers bloom in clusters, adding a delicate beauty to its natural habitat."
