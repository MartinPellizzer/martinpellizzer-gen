    "intro": "Grammitis nesiotica, commonly known as the New Zealand fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate rainforests. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Grammitis nesiotica plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
