    "intro": "Glyceria retroflexa, commonly known as the narrowleaf glyceria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like in appearance. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Glyceria retroflexa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
