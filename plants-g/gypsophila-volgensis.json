It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, clustered blooms that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its small, pea-like flowers are often used in floral arrangements due to their ornamental value.
