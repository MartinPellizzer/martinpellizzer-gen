    "intro": "Gagea pratensis subsp. gussonei, commonly known as the Alpine spring beauty, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in open, rocky habitats at high elevations, where it forms dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in early spring. It has a short rhizomatous root system that helps it survive in harsh mountainous conditions. This subspecies is characterized by its compact growth form and is often found in association with other alpine flora."
