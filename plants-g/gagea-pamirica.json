    "intro": "Gagea pamirica, commonly known as the Pamir spring beauty, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the high mountain regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows at elevations above 3,000 meters, where it thrives in rocky and alpine environments. Its bulbs store nutrients, allowing it to survive harsh winter conditions and bloom in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
