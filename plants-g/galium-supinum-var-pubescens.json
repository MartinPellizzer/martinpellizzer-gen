    "intro": "Galium supinum var. pubescens, commonly known as creeping bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
