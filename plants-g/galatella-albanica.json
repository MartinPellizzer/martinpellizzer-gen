    "intro": "Galatella albanica, commonly known as the Albanian bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the Balkan Peninsula. It typically grows in rocky and limestone soils, often in mountainous regions. The plant features slender stems with lance-shaped leaves and produces bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet. It blooms during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
