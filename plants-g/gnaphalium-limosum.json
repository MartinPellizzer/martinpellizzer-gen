    "intro": "Gnaphalium limosum, commonly known as bog myrtle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland areas in the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, branched clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and other wetland habitats. Gnaphalium limosum is also known for its aromatic properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
