    "intro": "Gymnogramma finlaysoniana, commonly known as the finlayson's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bioluminescent fronds that emit a faint blue glow in the dark. Native to Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments near water sources. The fronds are typically pinnately divided with a distinctive, narrow shape. Its unique glow is due to the presence of bioluminescent bacteria that colonize its leaves."
