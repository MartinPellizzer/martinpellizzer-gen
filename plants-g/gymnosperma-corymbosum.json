    "intro": "Gymnosperma corymbosum, commonly known as the American chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Fagaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves. The tree produces small, spiky fruits called nuts, which are encased in a prickly husk. Gymnosperma corymbosum was once a dominant species in forests but has been nearly wiped out by the chestnut blight, a fungal disease. Its ecological and historical significance remains a focus of conservation efforts."
