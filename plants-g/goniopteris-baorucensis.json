    "intro": "Goniopteris baorucensis, commonly known as the Baorucun fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to China. It is characterized by its distinctive, large, and intricately veined fronds that resemble those of its fossil relatives from the Carboniferous period. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with a short, creeping rhizome and bipinnate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, Goniopteris baorucensis is considered a valuable species for studying evolutionary botany and paleobotanical research."
