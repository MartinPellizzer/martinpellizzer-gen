    "intro": "Gaultheria fragrantissima var. punctata, commonly known as the spotted wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features elliptical, dark green leaves with distinctive white or pale spots along the midrib, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in late summer. These berries are edible and have a sharp, aromatic flavor, often used in culinary applications. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest environments."
