It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with slender, wiry stems covered in small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in racemes and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits. Genista libanotica is also valued in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
