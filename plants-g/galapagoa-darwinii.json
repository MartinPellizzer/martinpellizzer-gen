    "intro": "Galapagoa darwinii, commonly known as Darwin's galapagoa, is a unique flowering plant native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant's flowers are typically red or orange, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and insects. It thrives in humid, coastal environments and is adapted to the island's unique climate. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
