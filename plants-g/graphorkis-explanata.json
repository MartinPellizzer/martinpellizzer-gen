    "intro": "Graphorkis explanata, commonly known as the broad-leafed orchid, is a species of orchid native to the wet tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its ornamental value and habitat specificity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
