    "intro": "Gentiana damyonensis subsp. hicksii, commonly known as the Hicks' gentian, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom during the summer months. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
