    "intro": "Grammitis scabristipes, commonly known as the rough-stemmed maidenhair fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky outcrops. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces delicate, feather-like fronds with a distinctive scaly appearance. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. The plant's unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
