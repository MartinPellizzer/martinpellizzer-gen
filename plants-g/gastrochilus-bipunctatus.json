    "intro": "Gastrochilus bipunctatus, commonly known as the two-spotted lip, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a unique morphology, featuring a slender rhizome and a single, fleshy, green pseudobulb. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a lip that has two distinct spots, giving it its common name. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its natural habitat."
