    "intro": "Glechoma glutinosa, commonly known as sticky willow herb, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a sticky, glandular substance, which gives the plant its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Glechoma glutinosa is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
