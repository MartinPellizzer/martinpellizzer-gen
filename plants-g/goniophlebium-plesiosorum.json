    "intro": "Goniophlebium plesiosorum, commonly known as the pleiosorus fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. The botanical features of Goniophlebium plesiosorum make it a distinctive and ecologically significant component of its native habitats."
