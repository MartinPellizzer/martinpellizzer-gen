    "intro": "Galium sterneri, commonly known as the dwarf bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny white to pinkish flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. Galium sterneri thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its delicate appearance and ecological role in supporting insect life make it an important component of its native habitat."
