    "intro": "Galium attenuatum, commonly known as slender bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features thin, wiry stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and usually have a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Galium attenuatum is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in cultivated areas."
