    "intro": "Grammitis glabra, commonly known as the smooth grammitis, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant has slender, dark green fronds that are usually less than 30 centimeters in length. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Grammitis glabra plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
