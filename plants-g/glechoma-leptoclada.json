    "intro": "Glechoma leptoclada, commonly known as creeping Jenny, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating and produces small, blue or violet flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Glechoma leptoclada is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in garden settings."
