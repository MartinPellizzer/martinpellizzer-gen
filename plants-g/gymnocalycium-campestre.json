    "intro": "Gymnocalycium campestre, commonly known as the desert rose or the moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its globular shape and thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant flowers in shades of pink, yellow, and red, which bloom during the warmer months. Its spines are short and often covered in a fine, white coating. Gymnocalycium campestre is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
