    "intro": "Graphorkis pratensis, commonly known as the meadow graphorkis, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to parts of Europe and is typically found in moist meadows and grasslands. The plant has slender, upright stems that bear lance-shaped leaves arranged in a basal rosette. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in a spike, with a distinctive violet or purple coloration. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest in ecological studies due to its habitat specificity."
