    "intro": "Gnaphalium glutinosum var. puberulum, commonly known as sticky everlasting or sticky cudweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with numerous small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically covered in a fine, sticky resin, which gives the plant its common name and helps protect it from herbivores. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white flowers that are clustered in dense heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along streambanks."
