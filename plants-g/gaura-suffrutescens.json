    "intro": "Gaura suffrutescens, commonly known as the everlasting gaura, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, typically arranged alternately along the stem. Gaura suffrutescens is well-suited for garden use due to its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators."
