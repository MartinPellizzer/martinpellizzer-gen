    "intro": "Gesneria gracilis, commonly known as the slender gesneria, is a species of flowering plant in the Gesneriaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. This evergreen shrub is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Gesneria gracilis is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its attractive foliage and ornamental flowers."
