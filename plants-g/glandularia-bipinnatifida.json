    "intro": "Glandularia bipinnatifida, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, bipinnatifid leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, clustered purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Its glandular surfaces and hairy stems are notable botanical features. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as fields and woodland edges."
