    "intro": "Galanthus panjutinii, commonly known as the Panjutin's snowdrop, is a rare and delicate perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It produces slender, white flowers with a distinctive greenish tinge, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
