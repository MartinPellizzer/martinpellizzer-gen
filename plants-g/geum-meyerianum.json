It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its basal leaves that are palmately lobed and its clusters of small, showy flowers. The flowers, which are typically pink or red, bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to naturalize in suitable environments."
