    "intro": "Glossoloma wiehleri, commonly known as the Madagascar ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid native to the rainforests of Madagascar. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with pale green, leaf-like structures that resemble foliage rather than typical orchid leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often hidden within its vegetative mass, making them difficult to spot. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
