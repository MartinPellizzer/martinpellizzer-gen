    "intro": "Gynandriris torta, commonly known as the twisted gynandriris, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as under forest canopies, and thrives in tropical climates. Its leaves are usually elliptical with a slightly waxy texture, and the flowers are often pale green or white. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and understudied species in botanical research."
