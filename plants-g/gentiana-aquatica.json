    "intro": "Gentiana aquatica, commonly known as water gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, along stream banks, and in lake margins. The plant features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in aquatic habitats."
