    "intro": "Gymnelaea sandwicensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian gymnelaea, is a rare endemic plant found exclusively in the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers and hairy leaves. This plant typically grows in rocky or disturbed habitats, often in low elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Conservation efforts are essential to protect this unique botanical species from further decline."
