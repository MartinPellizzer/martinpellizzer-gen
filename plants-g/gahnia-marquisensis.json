    "intro": "Gahnia marquisensis, commonly known as the Marquis sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its triangular, fibrous stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland or swampy habitats, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It produces small, clustered spikelets that are often reddish-brown in color, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
