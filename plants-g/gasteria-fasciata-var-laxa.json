This compact, evergreen succulent is native to South Africa and features rosettes of thick, fleshy, dark green leaves with white or yellowish markings. The leaves are arranged in a tight spiral, giving the plant a distinctive, almost geometric appearance. It produces small, pale greenish-white flowers on tall, slender stems during the warmer months. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with bright, indirect light."
