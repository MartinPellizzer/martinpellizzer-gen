    "intro": "Genlisea minor, commonly known as the bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its unique bladder-like structures, which it uses to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and wetlands. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface. Genlisea minor is a carnivorous plant, relying on its specialized traps for nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor environments."
