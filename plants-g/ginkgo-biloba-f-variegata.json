    "intro": "Ginkgo biloba f. variegata, commonly known as the variegated ginkgo, is a unique cultivar of the ginkgo tree characterized by its striking leaf patterns. The leaves are typically a mix of green, yellow, and sometimes white, creating a visually appealing contrast. This form is a naturally occurring variant, though it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic value. It retains the same dioecious nature as the common ginkgo, with separate male and female trees. The tree is well-suited to urban environments and is valued for its tolerance to pollution and urban conditions."
