    "intro": "Gypsophila haussknechtii, commonly known as the desert candytuft, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, clustered white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand harsh, dry conditions. Its small, fleshy leaves help reduce water loss, and it often thrives in full sun. Gypsophila haussknechtii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-maintenance gardens."
