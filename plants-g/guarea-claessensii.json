It is characterized by its dense, hard wood, which is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The tree has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a leathery texture. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, typically appearing in yellow or greenish-white colors. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its role in local ecosystems and traditional uses."
