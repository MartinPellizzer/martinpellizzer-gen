    "intro": "Grammatophyllum fastuosum, commonly known as the giant spider orchid, is a striking tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences that can reach up to 3 meters in height, adorned with intricate, spider-like flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its leaves are broad and leathery, typically arranged in a rosette pattern to conserve moisture. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
