It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in high-altitude forests and is adapted to cool, moist environments. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of hair. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
