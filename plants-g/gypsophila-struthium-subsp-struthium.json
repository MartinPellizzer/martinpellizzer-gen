    "intro": "Gypsophila struthium subsp. struthium, commonly known as the common teasel, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely leafed stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and the stems are covered in a dense layer of fine, bristly hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides."
