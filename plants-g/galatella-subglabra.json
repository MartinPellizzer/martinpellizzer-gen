    "intro": "Galatella subglabra, commonly known as the smooth galatella, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the eastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along streambanks. Galatella subglabra is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
