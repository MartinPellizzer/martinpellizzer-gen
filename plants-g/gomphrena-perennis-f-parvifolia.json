It features small, tightly packed, rose-purple to pink bracts that resemble tiny flowers, giving it a delicate, ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked in favor of its showy bracts. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its drought tolerance and long-lasting blooms make it a hardy and low-maintenance addition to gardens."
