    "intro": "Geissorhiza ornithogaloides subsp. ornithogaloides, commonly known as the yellow rain lily, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features a fleshy, underground bulb that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking yellow, star-shaped flowers during the rainy season, typically in summer. Its leaves are strap-like and grass-like, often with a reddish tinge at the base. It is well adapted to rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats."
