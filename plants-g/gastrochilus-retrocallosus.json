    "intro": "Gastrochilus retrocallosus, commonly known as the wrinkled lip orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, wrinkled lip that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its flowers are small, usually white or pale pink, and bloom during the spring and early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
