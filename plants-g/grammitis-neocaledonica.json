    "intro": "Grammitis neocaledonica, commonly known as the New Caledonian fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the island of New Caledonia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often clustered in dense tufts. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are usually bright green and have a distinct, serrated margin. Grammitis neocaledonica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
