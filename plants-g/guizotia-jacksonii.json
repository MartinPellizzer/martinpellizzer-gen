    "intro": "Guizotia jacksonii, commonly known as Jackson's guizotia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows as a low-growing shrub with hairy leaves and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in spring. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
