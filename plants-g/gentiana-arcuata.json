    "intro": "Gentiana arcuata, commonly known as the curved gentian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The genus Gentiana belongs to the family Gentianaceae, known for its showy, often blue or yellow flowers."
