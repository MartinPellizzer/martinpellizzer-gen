    "intro": "Geonoma bartletii, commonly known as the Bartlett's bryophyte, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is a small, terrestrial bromeliad that typically grows in shaded, humid environments. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a water-holding cup at the center. Its foliage is often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Geonoma bartletii is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America."
