    "intro": "Gymnocalycium kuehhasii subsp. corneispinum, commonly known as the horned moon cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its globular, ribbed stem that can reach up to 30 cm in height, with a thick, spiny coating that provides protection against herbivores. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to desert environments. It is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
