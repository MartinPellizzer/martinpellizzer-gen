    "intro": "Grielum cuneifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf false heather, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in wetlands and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist, sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. Grielum cuneifolium is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
