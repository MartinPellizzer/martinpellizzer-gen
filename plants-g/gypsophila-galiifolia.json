    "intro": "Gypsophila galiifolia, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking, spiky flower heads that resemble small, delicate thrones. The plant has silvery-gray leaves that help reflect sunlight and reduce water loss, adapting it to its arid environment. It produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. Gypsophila galiifolia is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
