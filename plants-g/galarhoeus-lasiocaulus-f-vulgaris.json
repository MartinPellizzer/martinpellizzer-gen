    "intro": "Galarhoeus lasiocaulus f. vulgaris, commonly known as the common woolly heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, hairy foliage. It typically features small, leathery leaves covered in fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. This species is often found in coastal and inland heathlands, contributing to the ecological diversity of such habitats."
