    "intro": "Galium subvelutinum subsp. pseudokurdicum, commonly known as the Kurdish bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Turkey and the Caucasus. It typically features slender, hairy stems that lie close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes."
