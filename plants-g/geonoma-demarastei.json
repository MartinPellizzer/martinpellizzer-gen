The plant features a rosette of lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its reproductive structures, called sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Geonoma demarastei plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to the biodiversity of the understory vegetation."
