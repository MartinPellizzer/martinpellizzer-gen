    "intro": "Gleichenia linearis var. tetraphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the Gleichenia linearis species. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 20\u201340 cm in length. The plant produces sporangia in clusters, which are arranged in four rows along the fertile fronds, giving it its specific epithet *tetraphylla*. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. This fern is notable for its intricate morphology and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
