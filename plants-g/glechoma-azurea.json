    "intro": "Glechoma azurea, commonly known as blue dead-nettle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its creeping growth habit allows it to spread along the ground, forming dense mats. Glechoma azurea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
