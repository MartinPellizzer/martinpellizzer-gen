    "intro": "Gentiana gaspensis, commonly known as the Gasp\u00e9 gentian, is a flowering plant native to the Gasp\u00e9 Peninsula in eastern Canada. It is a member of the Gentianaceae family, known for its striking blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along stream banks and in shaded woodlands. It produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
