    "intro": "Glaucium flavum var. vestitum, commonly known as the yellow flax or yellow hound's tongue, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a taproot system and produces a capsule fruit containing numerous small, rounded seeds. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, powdery coating that gives them a bluish-gray appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
