    "intro": "Gomphostemma strobilinum subsp. acaule, commonly known as the naked-stemmed false indigo, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody, shrub-like structure with a distinct lack of a true stem, as the plant grows from a caudex. The leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, while the flowers are clustered in racemes and are typically blue or violet in color. This subspecies is part of the Loganiaceae family and is known for its ornamental value and ecological importance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats."
