    "intro": "Galium sylvestre var. microphyllum, commonly known as lesser woodcrushers, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a slightly hairy texture, and it typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. This variant is distinguished by its smaller leaves compared to the typical G. sylvestre."
