    "intro": "Gagea nabievii, commonly known as the Nabievo's spring beauty, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are basal, narrow, and grass-like, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gagea nabievii is considered a rare and endangered species."
