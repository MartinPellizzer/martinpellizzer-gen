    "intro": "Griselinia scandens, commonly known as the climbing griselinia, is a vigorous evergreen shrub or climber native to New Zealand. It features dark green, glossy, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along its stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-white flowers that appear in clusters, followed by egg-shaped berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for hedging and landscaping. Due to its fast growth rate, it requires regular pruning to maintain its shape and prevent it from becoming invasive."
