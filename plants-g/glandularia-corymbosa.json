    "intro": "Glandularia corymbosa, commonly known as the clustered glandular mint, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves that emit a strong mint-like scent when crushed. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Glandularia corymbosa thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or arid environments. Its unique botanical features make it an attractive and hardy addition to xeriscapes and native plant gardens."
