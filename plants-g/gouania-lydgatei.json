    "intro": "Gouania lydgatei, commonly known as the Lydgate's gouania, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many economically important plants such as coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
