    "intro": "Grammitis fusca, commonly known as the pale fern or slender wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically light green to pale yellow in color. This epiphytic plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found growing on tree trunks or branches in tropical and subtropical regions. Its small, spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds, which are covered in a fine, hairy layer. Grammitis fusca is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
