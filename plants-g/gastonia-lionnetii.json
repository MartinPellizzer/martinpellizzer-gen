    "intro": "Gastonia lionnetii, commonly known as the lionnet's gastonia, is a rare and striking plant native to the understory of tropical rainforests in Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, velvety, heart-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the early morning, releasing a subtle fragrance. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected reserves."
