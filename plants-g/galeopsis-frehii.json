    "intro": "Galeopsis frehii, commonly known as the Mexican horseweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Galeopsis frehii is also known for its ability to spread rapidly through seeds dispersed by wind."
