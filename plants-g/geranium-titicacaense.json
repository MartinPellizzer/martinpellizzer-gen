    "intro": "Geranium titicacaense, commonly known as the Andean geranium, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink and red. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. It is often found in rocky or alpine regions, where it adapts well to harsh climatic conditions. Geranium titicacaense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
