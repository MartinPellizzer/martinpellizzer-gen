    "intro": "Gaultheria fragrantissima, commonly known as the fragrant wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, waxy leaves that emit a strong, pleasant scent when crushed. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories. Gaultheria fragrantissima is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has historical uses in herbal medicine."
