    "intro": "Gnaphalium, commonly known as the everlasting flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their compact, often tufted growth habit and small, daisy-like flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Many species produce a fine, powdery substance called myrrh, which gives them a distinctive aromatic quality. They are native to various regions across Europe, Asia, and Africa, often thriving in dry, sunny environments. Gnaphalium species are frequently used in horticulture for their ornamental value and are also valued in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
