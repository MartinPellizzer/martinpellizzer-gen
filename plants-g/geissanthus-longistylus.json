    "intro": "Geissanthus longistylus, commonly known as the long-styled geissanthus, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of red and orange. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in cloud forests and rocky slopes. Its unique floral structure features elongated stamens and a prominent pistil, which are adaptations for specific pollinators. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
