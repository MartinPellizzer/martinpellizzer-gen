    "intro": "Gnaphalium nudifolium, commonly known as the nakedleaf cudweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It typically features small, thread-like leaves that are often absent or reduced, giving it its \"nudifolium\" designation. The plant produces tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in dense clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and stream banks. Its fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds contribute to its ability to spread and colonize new areas."
