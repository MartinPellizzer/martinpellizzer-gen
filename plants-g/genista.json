    "intro": "Genista, commonly known as buckthorn, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These shrubs are characterized by their small, often spiny leaves and yellow or orange flowers that bloom in spring. They are native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of western Asia. Genista species are often found in dry, rocky soils and can thrive in sunny, well-drained environments. Some species are used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
