    "intro": "Gentiana pleurogynoides var. abbreviata, commonly known as the dwarf gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a food source for certain pollinators and its ornamental value in horticultural settings."
