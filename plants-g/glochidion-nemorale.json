    "intro": "Glochidion nemorale, commonly known as the forest glochidion, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers, which are often overlooked due to their inconspicuous nature. Glochidion nemorale is typically found in moist, shaded forest understories, where it thrives in humid and well-drained soil conditions. Its ecological role includes providing shelter and food for various insect species."
