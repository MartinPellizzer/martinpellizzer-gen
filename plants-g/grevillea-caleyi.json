    "intro": "Grevillea caleyi, commonly known as the coastal grevillea, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Western Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking, feather-like inflorescences that range in color from red to orange, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and strong winds. Grevillea caleyi is an important component of the local flora and is often found in sandy or rocky coastal habitats."
