    "intro": "Grammitis davalliacea, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows on trees or rocks, forming dense, low-growing mats with intricate, feather-like fronds. The plant's leaves are usually a striking silver-gray color, which helps reflect excess sunlight in its shaded habitat. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Grammitis davalliacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native environments."
