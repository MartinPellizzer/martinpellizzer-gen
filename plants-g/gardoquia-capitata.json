    "intro": "Gardoquia capitata, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its yellow flowers bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy seed heads that disperse seeds by wind. Gardoquia capitata is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability."
