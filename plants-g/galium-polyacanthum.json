    "intro": "Galium polyacanthum, commonly known as the hairy bedstraw, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers clustered in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. Galium polyacanthum is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
