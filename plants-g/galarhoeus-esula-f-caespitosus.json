    "intro": "Galarhoeus esula f. caespitosus, commonly known as the tufted sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically succulent and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. This subspecies is often found in rocky or sandy soils, where it thrives in full sun."
