    "intro": "Gardenia resinosa subsp. resinosa, commonly known as the resinous gardenia, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant, white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces a resinous substance in its bark, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a perfume ingredient. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and greenhouses in warmer climates."
