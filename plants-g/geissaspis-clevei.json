    "intro": "Geissaspis clevei, commonly known as the Cleveland's spider orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its intricate, spider-like appearance, with long, slender petals and a distinctive, elongated spur. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in dense forest undergrowth. Its flowers are usually a combination of white, green, and yellow, with a strong, sweet fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its rarity and unique morphology, it is highly valued in both botanical research and horticultural collections."
