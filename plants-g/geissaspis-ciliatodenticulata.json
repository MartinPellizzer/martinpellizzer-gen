It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves that are covered in soft, hairy structures, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Its root system is fibrous and often grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands or stream banks. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare species with limited distribution."
