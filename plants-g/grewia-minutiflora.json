    "intro": "Grewia minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered bushwillow, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It features small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The leaves are simple, opposite, and often covered with fine hairs, giving them a soft texture. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that are typically red or yellow when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to semi-arid climates."
