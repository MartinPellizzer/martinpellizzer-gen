    "intro": "Gomphia floribunda var. major, commonly known as the giant gomphia, is a striking plant native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 3 meters. The plant produces large, showy inflorescences composed of numerous small, pale yellow flowers arranged in a dense cluster. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The species is notable for its unique morphology and ecological significance in its native habitat."
