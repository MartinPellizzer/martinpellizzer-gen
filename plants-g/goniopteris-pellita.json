    "intro": "Goniopteris pellita, commonly known as the small shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, shield-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a creeping underground stem that allows it to spread across the forest floor. Its leaves are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, almost triangular appearance when unfurled. Goniopteris pellita thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests."
