    "intro": "Grammitis parva, commonly known as the small grammitis, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Grammitis parva is often found in humid forests and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture."
