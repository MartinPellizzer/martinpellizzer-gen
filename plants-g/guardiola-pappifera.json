    "intro": "Guardiola pappifera, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant has finely divided leaves and produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its diet with captured prey. Its unique adaptations make it an interesting subject for studying plant evolution and ecological niches."
