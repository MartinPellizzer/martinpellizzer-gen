    "intro": "Gayophytum humile var. robustum, commonly known as the dwarf fireplant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a red or purple tint, especially when exposed to sunlight. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of yellow or orange, which bloom in summer. It is a low-growing species, often forming dense mats or clusters. Due to its compact size and attractive foliage, it is popular in rock gardens and as a container plant."
