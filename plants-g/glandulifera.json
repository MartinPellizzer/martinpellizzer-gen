    "intro": "Glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular-leaved plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. Its leaves are characterized by the presence of glandular structures, which secrete various substances. These glands can play roles in defense against herbivores or in attracting specific pollinators. The flowers are typically small and clustered, with pea-like petals, a common feature in the Fabaceae family. Glandulifera species are often found in temperate regions and can thrive in a variety of soil types."
