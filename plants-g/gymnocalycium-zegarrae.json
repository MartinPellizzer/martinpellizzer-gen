    "intro": "Gymnocalycium zegarrae, commonly known as the Zegarra's moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Andes Mountains of Peru. It is a small, globular plant with a thick, ribbed stem that can store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to rocky soils. Gymnocalycium zegarrae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its low maintenance requirements."
