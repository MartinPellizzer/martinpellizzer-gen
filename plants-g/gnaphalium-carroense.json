    "intro": "Gnaphalium carroense, commonly known as the Carribean feather grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to the Caribbean region and thrives in moist, sandy soils along coastal areas. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are surrounded by white or pale green bracts, giving it a feathery appearance. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. Gnaphalium carroense is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize coastal soils."
