It is characterized by its pubescent (hairy) leaves and stems, which give it its varietal name. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, often with a distinctive coloration that aids in pollination. The botanical features of this plant make it an interesting subject for study in ecological and taxonomic research."
