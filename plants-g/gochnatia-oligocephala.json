It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in shrubland and grassland habitats, often in regions with a Mediterranean climate. Its small, yellow flowers are arranged in dense clusters, and the plant produces small, woody fruits known as cypsela. Gochnatia oligocephala is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its compact growth habit."
