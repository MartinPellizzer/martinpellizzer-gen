    "intro": "Grewia populifolia, commonly known as the silky bush or silky leaf tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are soft and silky to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences, followed by small, red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in coastal and coastal plain areas. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
