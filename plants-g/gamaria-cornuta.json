    "intro": "Gamaria cornuta, commonly known as the horned water plant, is a species of aquatic plant found in freshwater environments. It is characterized by its distinctive, horn-like structures on its stems, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and thrives in muddy or sandy substrates. Its leaves are narrow and ribbon-like, often floating or partially submerged. Gamaria cornuta plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
