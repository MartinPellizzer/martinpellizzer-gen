    "intro": "Gnaphalium obtusifolium, commonly known as woolly cudweed, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, white, woolly covering on the stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are broad, rounded, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
