    "intro": "Geniosporum indicum, commonly known as the Indian spore plant, is a unique species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered in specialized clusters called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Geniosporum indicum plays a role in nutrient cycling and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
