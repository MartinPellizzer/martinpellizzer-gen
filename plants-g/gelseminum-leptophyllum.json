    "intro": "Gelseminum leptophyllum, commonly known as the slenderleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and tobacco. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters, with dark green, elliptical leaves. Its flowers are yellow with a distinctive red corolla, and it produces small, toxic berries that are often mistaken for edible fruits. Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care."
