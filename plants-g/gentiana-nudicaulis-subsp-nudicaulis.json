    "intro": "Gentiana nudicaulis subsp. nudicaulis, commonly known as the naked-stem gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, leafless stems that bear striking blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are tubular with five lobes and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees and butterflies. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in botanical gardens and alpine plant collections."
