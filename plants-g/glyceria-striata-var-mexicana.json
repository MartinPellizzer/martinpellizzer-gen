    "intro": "Glyceria striata var. mexicana, commonly known as Mexican wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of riparian and wetland ecosystems."
