    "intro": "Galium aquaticum, commonly known as water chickweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant that thrives in wet environments such as marshes, stream banks, and damp woodlands. It features small, opposite, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of tiny, white, star-shaped flowers. The plant has a sprawling growth habit with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, and it relies on insect pollination. Galium aquaticum is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils."
