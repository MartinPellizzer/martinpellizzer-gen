    "intro": "Galium circaezans var. typicum, commonly known as the common wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are heart-shaped and often have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in the spring, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a common sight in these habitats."
