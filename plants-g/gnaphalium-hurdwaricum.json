    "intro": "Gnaphalium hurdwaricum, commonly known as the Himalayan feather grass, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant produces a fluffy, white to pale yellow inflorescence, which resembles a cloud or feather, giving it its common name. It thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often growing in meadows and slopes at elevations above 3,000 meters. Gnaphalium hurdwaricum is also noted for its medicinal properties, used traditionally in local remedies for respiratory and skin conditions."
