    "intro": "Gaylussacia orocola, commonly known as the Florida huckleberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces clusters of white to pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. These berries are edible and serve as an important food source for wildlife, including birds and mammals. Its ability to thrive in acidic, sandy soils makes it a common plant in coastal and wetland habitats."
