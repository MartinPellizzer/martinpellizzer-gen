    "intro": "Gymnocondylus, commonly known as the naked knuckle orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes a distinctive, often showy labellum. The plants typically grow in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Gymnocondylus species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic. Their botanical significance lies in their specialized adaptations for pollination and their role in diverse ecosystems."
