    "intro": "Grammitis polyhymnia, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a fern species native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green, velvety fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, woolly layer of trichomes, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. Grammitis polyhymnia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
