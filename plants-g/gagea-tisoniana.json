    "intro": "Gagea tisoniana, commonly known as the Tison's bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Mexico. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its tuberous roots and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, often with a greenish tinge. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
