    "intro": "Gnaphalium micranthum, commonly known as the small-flowered cudweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, pale green leaves and produces tiny, clustered flower heads that are often surrounded by pale yellow to white bracts. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, woolly stems and is often found in moist, disturbed soils such as roadsides, meadows, and wetlands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and ragworts, and is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Gnaphalium micranthum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
