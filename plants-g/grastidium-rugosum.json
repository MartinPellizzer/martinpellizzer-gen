    "intro": "Grastidium rugosum, commonly known as the rough-horned orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, rugged, and textured leaf structure. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically blooming during the cooler months. Its growth is slow and requires specific environmental conditions, including high humidity and well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Grastidium rugosum is considered a conservation concern."
