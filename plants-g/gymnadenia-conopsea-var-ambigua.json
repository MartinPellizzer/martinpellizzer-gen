    "intro": "Gymnadenia conopsea var. ambigua, commonly known as the ambiguous goat's-rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in grassy meadows and open woodlands, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it produces small, elongated seed pods that release seeds through a unique mechanical mechanism. This variant is distinguished by subtle morphological differences from the typical form of Gymnadenia conopsea."
