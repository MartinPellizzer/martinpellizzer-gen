    "intro": "Galactia pedunculata, commonly known as the Mexican milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces pods that contain seeds with tufts of white hair, aiding in wind dispersal. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a hairy texture. Galactia pedunculata is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in such habitats."
