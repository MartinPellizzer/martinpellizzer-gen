It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky areas. Its flowers are usually pale purple or white, and it produces elongated, inflated seed pods that split open when mature. Gastrolychnis gracilis is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
