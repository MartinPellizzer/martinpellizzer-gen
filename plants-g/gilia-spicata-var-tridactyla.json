    "intro": "Gilia spicata var. tridactyla, commonly known as the three-fingered gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, often found in desert or semi-arid environments. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by hummingbirds and bees, and the plant produces small, three-lobed seed capsules. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinator populations."
