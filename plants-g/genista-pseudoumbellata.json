    "intro": "Genista pseudoumbellata, commonly known as the Spanish broom, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring slender, woody stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, pea-like flowers in early spring, which are arranged in umbellate inflorescences. Its flowering stems are often covered in fine, soft hairs, and the plant is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun. Genista pseudoumbellata is part of the Fabaceae family, known for its nitrogen-fixing abilities through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules."
