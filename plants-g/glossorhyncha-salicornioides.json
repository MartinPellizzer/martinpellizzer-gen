    "intro": "Glossorhyncha salicornioides, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its succulent, salt-tolerant leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer. Its root system is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils, making it well-suited for harsh maritime environments. Glossorhyncha salicornioides plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
