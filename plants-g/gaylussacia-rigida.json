    "intro": "Gaylussacia rigida, commonly known as black huckleberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its acidic soil preferences. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are edible and often used in jams and wines. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and have a leathery texture, while its stems are densely branched and often covered in short, stiff hairs. This species plays an important ecological role by providing food for wildlife and supporting forest understory biodiversity."
