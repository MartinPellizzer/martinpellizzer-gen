    "intro": "Gomphrena pulchella, commonly known as the red gayfeather, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking, spiky, pink to red bracts that resemble plumes, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Gomphrena pulchella is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
