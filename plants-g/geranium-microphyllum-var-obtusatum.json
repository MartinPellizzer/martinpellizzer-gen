    "intro": "Geranium microphyllum var. obtusatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved geranium, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, giving it its \"microphyllum\" designation. The plant produces clusters of showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink or red, which bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated for both its aesthetic appeal and its ability to attract pollinators."
