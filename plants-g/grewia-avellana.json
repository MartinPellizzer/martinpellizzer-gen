It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate or elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature.
