    "intro": "Grewia ancolana, commonly known as the red gum tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals but not typically for humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland areas. Grewia ancolana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide habitat for wildlife."
