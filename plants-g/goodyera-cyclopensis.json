    "intro": "Goodyera cyclopensis, commonly known as the cyclops maidenhair, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and intricate, spurred flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in forest understories. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in many areas."
