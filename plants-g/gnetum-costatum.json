    "intro": "Gnetum costatum, commonly known as the Costa's gnetum, is a unique gymnosperm native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, often colorful foliage, with leaves that can range from green to red or yellow, depending on the season. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and is known for its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures include both male and female cones, typical of gymnosperms. Gnetum costatum is also notable for its ability to form symbiotic relationships with fungi, enhancing its nutrient uptake in nutrient-poor soils."
