    "intro": "Glycine hispida var. nigricans-virescens, commonly known as the black and green hairy bean, is a climbing legume characterized by its dense, pubescent foliage. The leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet bearing a fine, hairy texture that gives the plant its common name. It produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and nutritional benefits. Its growth habit makes it suitable for use in trellises or as a ground cover in tropical gardens."
