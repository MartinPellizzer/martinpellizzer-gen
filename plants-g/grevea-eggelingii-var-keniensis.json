    "intro": "Grevea eggelingii var. keniensis, commonly known as the Kenyan grevea, is a flowering plant native to East Africa, particularly Kenya. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its woody structure and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested or semi-deciduous habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
