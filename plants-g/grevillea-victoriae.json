    "intro": "Grevillea victoriae, commonly known as the Victorian Grevillea, is a striking evergreen shrub native to southeastern Australia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and vibrant, feather-like red or orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and arid gardens. Its nectar-rich flowers attract nectar-feeding birds, particularly honeyeaters, contributing to local biodiversity. Grevillea victoriae is also valued for its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements."
