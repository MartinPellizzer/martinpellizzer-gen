It is characterized by its large, showy blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows up to 1.5 meters tall, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. The flowers are rich in nectar, making them a valuable resource for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
