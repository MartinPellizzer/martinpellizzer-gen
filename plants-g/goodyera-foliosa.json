    "intro": "Goodyera foliosa, commonly known as the miniature orchid or the ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on the trunks or branches of trees in the understory of forests. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture, and it produces delicate, orchid-like flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and decaying organic matter. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Goodyera foliosa is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
