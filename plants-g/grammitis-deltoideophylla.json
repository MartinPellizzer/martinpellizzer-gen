    "intro": "Grammitis deltoideophylla, commonly known as the deltoid leaf fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on trees in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has delicate, deltoid-shaped fronds that are often clustered together, giving it a compact appearance. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it anchor to its host, while its roots absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The fronds are usually green and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant retain water in humid environments."
