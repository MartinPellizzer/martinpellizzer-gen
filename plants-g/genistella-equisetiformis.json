    "intro": "Genistella equisetiformis, commonly known as the clubmoss fern, is a unique plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a creeping, rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in strobila. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant botanical interest."
