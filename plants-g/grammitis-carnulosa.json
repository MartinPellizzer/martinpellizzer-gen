    "intro": "Grammitis carnulosa, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a silvery or pale appearance due to the presence of trichomes on the leaf surface. This plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as tropical and subtropical forests, where it attaches itself to trees or rocks. Its small, inconspicuous spore-producing structures are located on the undersides of the fronds. Grammitis carnulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitats."
