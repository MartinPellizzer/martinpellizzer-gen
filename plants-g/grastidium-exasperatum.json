    "intro": "Grastidium exasperatum, commonly known as the fiery spurge, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its distinctive, often toxic sap. This herbaceous plant typically features alternate, simple leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia, which are typical of the spurge family. The plant is native to arid and semi-arid regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by both livestock and humans."
