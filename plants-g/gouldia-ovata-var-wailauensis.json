    "intro": "Gouldia ovata var. wailauensis, commonly known as the Wailauensis Gouldia, is a rare and striking plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, grassy leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale pink flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
