    "intro": "Gentiana scopulorum, commonly known as the rock gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds. Gentiana scopulorum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural environment."
