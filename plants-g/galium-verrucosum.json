    "intro": "Galium verrucosum, commonly known as rough bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, prostrate stems that are often covered in fine, warty tubercles, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and typically have a slightly hairy surface. Galium verrucosum is often found in moist, disturbed soils such as along roadsides, in meadows, and in woodland edges."
