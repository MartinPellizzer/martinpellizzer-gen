    "intro": "Getonia, commonly known as the \"buttercup plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Ranunculaceae. These plants are typically herbaceous, with simple, alternate leaves and showy, often yellow or orange flowers. They are native to various regions across the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, Asia, and North America. Getonia species are often found in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Some species are considered invasive in certain areas, outcompeting native flora due to their rapid growth and prolific seed production."
