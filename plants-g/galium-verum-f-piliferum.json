    "intro": "Galium verum f. piliferum, commonly known as yellow bedstraw, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and slender, hairy stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine, soft hairs. This variant is distinguished by its more pronounced hairy foliage compared to the typical form of Galium verum."
