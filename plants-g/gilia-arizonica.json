    "intro": "Gilia arizonica, commonly known as Arizona gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as desert scrub and grasslands. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Gilia arizonica plays an important role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies in its native range."
