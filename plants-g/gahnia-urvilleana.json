    "intro": "Gahnia urvilleana, commonly known as the slender tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical tussocks and slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typically flowering from spring to autumn. It thrives in wetland and swampy environments, often forming dense vegetation that stabilizes soil and provides habitat for various wildlife. Gahnia urvilleana plays an important ecological role in its native ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and water filtration."
