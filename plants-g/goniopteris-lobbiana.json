    "intro": "Goniopteris lobbiana, commonly known as the Lobb's moonwort, is a rare fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided fronds that resemble the shape of a fern's traditional form. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Goniopteris lobbiana is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
