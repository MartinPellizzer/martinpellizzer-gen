    "intro": "Galium humilioides, commonly known as the dwarf bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves and clusters of tiny white flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its stems are often prostrate or creeping, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous minute seeds. Galium humilioides is often found in disturbed or nutrient-rich soils, making it a common sight in early successional habitats."
