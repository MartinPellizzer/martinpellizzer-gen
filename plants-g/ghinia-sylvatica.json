    "intro": "Ghinia sylvatica, commonly known as the woodland bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodland habitats, preferring rich, well-drained soils. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, which are usually blue or violet in color. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stems. Ghinia sylvatica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
