    "intro": "Galenia pallens, commonly known as the coastal bluemink, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often found in coastal dunes and other maritime environments. Galenia pallens is adapted to tolerate salt spray and harsh coastal conditions, making it an important part of the local flora."
