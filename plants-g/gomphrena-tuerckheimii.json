    "intro": "Gomphrena tuerckheimii, commonly known as the dwarf torch flower, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to South Africa. It features striking, spiky, rose-purple to red bracts that resemble small torches, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are surrounded by the showy bracts, which serve to attract pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Gomphrena tuerckheimii is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established."
