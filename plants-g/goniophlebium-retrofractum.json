    "intro": "Goniophlebium retrofractum, commonly known as the reticulate fern, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its intricate, reticulate venation pattern on its fronds, which gives it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as tropical forests and rocky crevices. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a delicate, lace-like appearance. Goniophlebium retrofractum is notable for its evolutionary significance, representing a transitional form in the development of ferns."
