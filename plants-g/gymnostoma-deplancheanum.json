    "intro": "Gymnostoma deplancheanum, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming during the dry season. Its fibrous roots enable it to access deep groundwater, making it well adapted to harsh desert conditions. Gymnostoma deplancheanum plays an important ecological role by providing shelter and food for various desert fauna."
