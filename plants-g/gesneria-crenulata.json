    "intro": "Gesneria crenulata, commonly known as the serrated gesneria, is a species of flowering plant in the Gesneriaceae family. It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its striking, serrated leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically orange or yellow in color, adding visual interest to its foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Gesneria crenulata is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
