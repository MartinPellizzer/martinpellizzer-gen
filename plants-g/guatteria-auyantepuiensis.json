    "intro": "Guatteria auyantepuiensis, commonly known as the Yarumo or \"sacred plant\" of the Pemon people, is a flowering plant native to the tepuis of Venezuela and Guyana. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are used in traditional medicine and as a food source by local communities. Its unique habitat in the isolated highland regions of the Guiana Shield makes it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
