    "intro": "Gilia aggregata f. ventrensis, commonly known as the desert gilia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. The species is also notable for its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
