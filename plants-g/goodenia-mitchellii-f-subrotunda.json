    "intro": "Goodenia mitchellii f. subrotunda, commonly known as the narrow-leaf goodenia, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It features small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, blooming from late autumn to early spring. The leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its dry habitat. This plant is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open woodlands or along creeklines. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for native pollinators."
