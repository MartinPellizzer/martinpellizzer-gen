    "intro": "Grindelia cabrerae, commonly known as the coastal tarplant, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy, gray-green foliage. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and wind exposure. Grindelia cabrerae plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing dunes. However, it is considered endangered due to habitat loss and invasive species competition."
