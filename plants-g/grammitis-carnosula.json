    "intro": "Grammitis carnosula, commonly known as the thick-leaf fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery, and often fleshy foliage, which helps it retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitats. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, forming compact, mat-like structures. Its rhizomes are wiry and often covered in a layer of fine, silky hairs. Grammitis carnosula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden environments."
