    "intro": "Gagea soleirolii var. tenuis, commonly known as the slender gagea, is a rare and delicate bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its compact size and is often found in rocky or limestone soils. It is well adapted to dry, sunny environments and requires well-drained soil to thrive. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
