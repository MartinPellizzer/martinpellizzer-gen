It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense covering of spines. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
