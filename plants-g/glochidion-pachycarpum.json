    "intro": "Glochidion pachycarpum, commonly known as the thick-fruited glabrous wood, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually glabrous or nearly so. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by fleshy, orange-red berries. Its thick, fleshy fruits are adapted for dispersal by animals, and the plant is often found in moist, shaded environments. Glochidion pachycarpum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
