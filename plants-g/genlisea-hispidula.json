    "intro": "Genlisea hispidula, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like traps used to capture prey. The plant typically grows in wet, nutrient-poor soils, such as marshes and bogs. Its leaves are often submerged, and it lacks true roots, relying on its stems for anchorage. The hairy texture of its stems and leaves is a distinguishing feature, aiding in its identification."
