    "intro": "Gagea praemixta, commonly known as the mixed gagea, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to the western United States, particularly California and Oregon, where it grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and forest floors. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early spring. Its bulbs are clustered and often covered in a thin, papery sheath, which helps protect them during dormancy. Gagea praemixta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
