    "intro": "Geunsia furfuracea, commonly known as the fuzzy carpet grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, fibrous leaves that give it a distinctive fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the grass family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Geunsia furfuracea is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in riparian areas."
