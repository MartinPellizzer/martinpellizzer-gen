    "intro": "Goniopteris costata, commonly known as the ribbed water fern, is a member of the fern family with distinctive fronds. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a complex structure that features a central rib and secondary veins. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. It has a long evolutionary history, dating back to the Carboniferous period. The fronds exhibit a unique pattern of venation that aids in its identification and ecological adaptation."
