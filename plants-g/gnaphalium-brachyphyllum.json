    "intro": "Gnaphalium brachyphyllum, commonly known as the cushion dandelion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit, forming a cushion-like structure that helps it survive in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which contribute to its ability to retain moisture. Gnaphalium brachyphyllum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
