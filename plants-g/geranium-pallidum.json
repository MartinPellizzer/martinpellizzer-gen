    "intro": "Geranium pallidum, commonly known as the pale geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features upright, hairy stems that can grow up to 60 cm in height, and its leaves are palmately lobed with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Geranium pallidum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
