    "intro": "Globularia trichosantha, commonly known as the woolly globularia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, compact foliage with a woolly texture due to its fine, white hairs covering the leaves and stems. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer, adding a delicate ornamental touch. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its compact form and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for Mediterranean-style gardens."
