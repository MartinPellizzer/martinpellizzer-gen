    "intro": "Gossypium thurberi, commonly known as Thurber's cotton, is a species of wild cotton native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that produces fluffy, white cotton-like fibers, which are used for textile purposes. The plant has simple, alternate leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It is adapted to arid environments and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Gossypium thurberi is valued for its ecological role and has been studied for its potential in sustainable fiber production."
