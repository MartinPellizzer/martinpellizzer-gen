    "intro": "Grammitis nutata, commonly known as the slender grammitis, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows on trees or rocks, forming dense, mat-like colonies. The plant has delicate, linear leaves that are often arranged in two rows along the stem. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Grammitis nutata thrives in humid environments and is often found in forest understories where it receives indirect light."
