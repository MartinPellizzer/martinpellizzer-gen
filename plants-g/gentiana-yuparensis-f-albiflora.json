    "intro": "Gentiana yuparensis f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered gentian, is a rare and striking plant native to the Andean highlands of South America. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family, characterized by its showy, blue or white flowers that often bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its flowers are tubular with prominent blue or white petals, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
