    "intro": "Goodyera bomiensis, commonly known as the Bomi orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its small, dark green leaves and delicate, translucent flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky substrates or among mosses. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it faces significant threats to its survival."
