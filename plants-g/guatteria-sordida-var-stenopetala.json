    "intro": "Guatteria sordida var. stenopetala, commonly known as the narrow-petaled guatteria, is a species of flowering plant in the family Annonaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in countries like Mexico and Panama. The plant is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and produces fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers. Its fruits are typically berries that contain several seeds, and the plant often grows in shaded, humid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within its family."
