    "intro": "Galium exstipulatum, commonly known as slender bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny white or pale pink flowers, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Galium exstipulatum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves and stems are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance."
