    "intro": "Galium uruguayense, commonly known as the Uruguay bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Uruguay and parts of Argentina. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in cymes, typical of the genus Galium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and wetlands. Galium uruguayense is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
