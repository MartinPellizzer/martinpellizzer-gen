The plant typically blooms in the spring and summer, producing numerous seed pods that are cylindrical and often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in arid and semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it an important species for pollinators and a subject of study in ecological and evolutionary botany."
