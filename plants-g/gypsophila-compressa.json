    "intro": "Gypsophila compressa, commonly known as the cushion gypsophila, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing, cushion-like growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh, arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss and withstand strong winds. Gypsophila compressa is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
