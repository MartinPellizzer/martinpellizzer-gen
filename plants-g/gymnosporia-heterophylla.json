    "intro": "Gymnosporia heterophylla, commonly known as the variable leaf burr bush, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with leaves ranging from narrow and linear to broad and ovate. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by woody, spiny fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and the plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Gymnosporia heterophylla is valued for its ornamental potential and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
