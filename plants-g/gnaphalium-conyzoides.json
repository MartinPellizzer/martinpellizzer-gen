    "intro": "Gnaphalium conyzoides, commonly known as the common cudweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of tiny white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces copious amounts of fine, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its widespread distribution. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils, often in temperate regions. Gnaphalium conyzoides is also noted for its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
