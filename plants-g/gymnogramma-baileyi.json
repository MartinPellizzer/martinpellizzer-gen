    "intro": "Gymnogramma baileyi, commonly known as the Bailey's rock fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its compact, creeping growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates or in shaded, moist environments, showcasing its adaptability to challenging conditions. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are usually smaller and more compact than the sterile ones. Gymnogramma baileyi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
