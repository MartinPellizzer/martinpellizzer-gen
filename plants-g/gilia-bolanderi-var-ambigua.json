    "intro": "Gilia bolanderi var. ambigua, commonly known as the Bolander's gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. It is an annual or biennial species, depending on the region, and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to harsh desert conditions."
