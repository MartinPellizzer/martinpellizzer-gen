    "intro": "Gymnocalycium castellanosii subsp. acorrugatum, commonly known as the rugose moon cactus, is a succulent native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its thick, spiny stems that store water. The plant typically produces vibrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red during the growing season. Its subspecies, acorrugatum, is distinguished by its more pronounced corrugations on the stem surface. It is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
