    "intro": "Gonzalagunia panamensis var. longistipula, commonly known as the Panama longistipula, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific regions of Central America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive floral structures and leaf morphology. The plant typically grows in humid, tropical environments, often in shaded undergrowth within dense forests. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with specialized stamen structures that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change."
