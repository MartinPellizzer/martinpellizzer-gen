    "intro": "Grammitis novoguineensis, commonly known as the New Guinea grammitis, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green and covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread along the forest floor. Grammitis novoguineensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
