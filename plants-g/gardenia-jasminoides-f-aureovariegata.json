    "intro": "Gardenia jasminoides f. aureovariegata, commonly known as the variegated gardenia, is a hybrid plant prized for its ornamental value. It features glossy, dark green leaves with striking yellow and white variegation, enhancing its visual appeal. The plant produces fragrant, waxy white flowers that bloom in summer, adding to its ornamental charm. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to cold, it is often cultivated in containers for easier management."
