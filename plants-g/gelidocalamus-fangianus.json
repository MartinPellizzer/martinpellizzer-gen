    "intro": "Gelidocalamus fangianus, commonly known as the Fang's cold bamboo, is a unique grass species native to high-altitude regions of China. It is characterized by its slender, hollow stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to cold and moist environments. This plant thrives in temperate climates with high humidity and well-drained soils. Its growth is typically slow, and it forms dense clumps that can persist for several years. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
