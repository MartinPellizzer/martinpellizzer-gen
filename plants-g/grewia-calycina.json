    "intro": "Grewia calycina, commonly known as the silverleaf gum, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to southern Africa. It features small, simple leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white layer of hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, three-lobed fruits. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. The plant has a shallow root system and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive foliage and resilience."
