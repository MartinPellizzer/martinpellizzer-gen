It features a rosette of fleshy, silver-blue leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a frosty appearance. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a desirable addition to both indoor and outdoor collections."
