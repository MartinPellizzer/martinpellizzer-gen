It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces vibrant red or orange flower spikes during the spring and summer months, which attract a variety of pollinators such as birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in both natural and landscaped environments."
