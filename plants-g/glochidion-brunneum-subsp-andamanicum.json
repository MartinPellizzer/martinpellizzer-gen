    "intro": "Glochidion brunneum subsp. andamanicum, commonly known as the Andaman glabrous tamarind, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Andaman Islands. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually glabrous or nearly so. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, fleshy fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in tropical rainforest environments and is often found in moist, shaded areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
