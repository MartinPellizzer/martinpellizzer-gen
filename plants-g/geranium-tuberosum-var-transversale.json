    "intro": "Geranium tuberosum var. transversale, commonly known as the Transverse Geranium, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features upright stems with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long flowering period."
