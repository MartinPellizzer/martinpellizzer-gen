    "intro": "Genista verae, commonly known as the Spanish broom, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, sunny environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Its leaves are small, narrow, and usually appear in pairs along the stems. Genista verae is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other regions for horticultural purposes."
