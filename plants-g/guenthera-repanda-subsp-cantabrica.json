    "intro": "Guenthera repanda subsp. cantabrica, commonly known as the Cantabrian guenthera, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller, more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of Guenthera repanda. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or semi-shaded habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
