    "intro": "Geranium procurrens, commonly known as the creeping geranium, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a mat-forming habit with slender stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, or violet, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Geranium procurrens is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
