    "intro": "Genista hirsuta f. trichoacantha, commonly known as the hairy bursch or hairy genista, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine, hairy glands, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is particularly noted for its thick, spiny branches, which give it a rugged, ornamental look. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and visual appeal."
