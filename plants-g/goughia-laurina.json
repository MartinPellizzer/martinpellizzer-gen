    "intro": "Goughia laurina, commonly known as the silverleaf goughia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a small shrub that typically grows in coastal and mountainous regions. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are leathery and covered in a fine silvery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Goughia laurina is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
