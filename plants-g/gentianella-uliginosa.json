    "intro": "Gentianella uliginosa, commonly known as the marsh gentian, is a flowering plant native to wetland and bog environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers, which typically bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. It thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshy areas. Gentianella uliginosa plays an important ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining wetland biodiversity."
