    "intro": "Gallitrichum anglicum, commonly known as the English gall or gall-weed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and small, alternate leaves that are typically oval to lance-shaped. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and is native to Europe. Gallitrichum anglicum is sometimes considered a weed due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
