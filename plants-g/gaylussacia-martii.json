    "intro": "Gaylussacia martii, commonly known as the Florida huckleberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heaths and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces bell-shaped, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, dark red berries in the fall. These berries are an important food source for wildlife, including birds and small mammals. The shrub thrives in acidic, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and pine flatwoods."
