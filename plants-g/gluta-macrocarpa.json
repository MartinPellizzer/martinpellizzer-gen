It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its native habitat. It produces fleshy, red berries that are edible and often consumed by local wildlife. Gluta macrocarpa is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
