It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of the leaves, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Gymnogramma bidentata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
