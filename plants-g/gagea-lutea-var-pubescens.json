    "intro": "Gagea lutea var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy yellow bulbous plant, is a perennial species native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellow, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features a bulbous base with fibrous roots and narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from the base. Its hairy stems and foliage are adaptations to its arid and rocky habitats. It is often found in open woodlands and meadows, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
