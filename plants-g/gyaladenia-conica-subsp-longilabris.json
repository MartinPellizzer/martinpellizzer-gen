    "intro": "Gyaladenia conica subsp. longilabris, commonly known as the long-lipped bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its elongated, narrow lips on the flower corolla, which give it its specific epithet. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in open meadows or on slopes. The plant is relatively rare and is considered a specialist species adapted to cold, harsh environments."
