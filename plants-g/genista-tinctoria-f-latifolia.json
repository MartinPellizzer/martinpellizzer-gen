It is a shrub characterized by its slender, often branching stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are typically broader than those of the typical species, giving it a distinct appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or dry landscapes. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in dye production."
