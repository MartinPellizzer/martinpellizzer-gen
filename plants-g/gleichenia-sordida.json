    "intro": "Gleichenia sordida, commonly known as the dirty maidenhair fern, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Gleicheniaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that often appear somewhat dull or sooty. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Gleichenia sordida is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
