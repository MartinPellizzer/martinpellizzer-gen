It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically white or pale green in color, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually purple or blue, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Glechoma leucophylla is known for its spreading habit and is sometimes used in ornamental gardening."
