    "intro": "Galium orbibracteatum, commonly known as the orb-bract evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant has hairy, linear leaves and develops distinctive orbicular bracts around its flower clusters. It is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Galium orbibracteatum is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
