It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers in early spring. The plant belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its underground bulbs that store nutrients for growth. Its flowers are typically borne on long, slender stems and are often pollinated by insects. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens."
