    "intro": "Gerardia keyensis, commonly known as Key Island gerardia, is a flowering plant native to the Florida Keys. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and coastal areas, and thrives in saline or brackish conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are small and clustered, often with a yellow center and white petals. Gerardia keyensis plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for local wildlife."
