    "intro": "Genoplesium sagittiferum, commonly known as the arrow-leaved orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its linear, arrow-shaped leaves and produces striking, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and understoreys. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is known for its delicate, ephemeral blooms that appear in spring. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and threatened species in some regions."
