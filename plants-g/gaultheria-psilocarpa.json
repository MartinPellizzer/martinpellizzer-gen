    "intro": "Gaultheria psilocarpa, commonly known as the red-berried wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and clusters of small, red berries that ripen in the fall. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by the distinctive red berries. Gaultheria psilocarpa contains aromatic compounds such as methyl salicylate, which contribute to its sharp, wintergreen scent. It is often found in moist, acidic soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
