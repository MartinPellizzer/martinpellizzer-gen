    "intro": "Galipea macrophylla, commonly known as the great-leafed guayacan, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody fruits containing several seeds. Its bark is thick and often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. The plant is also valued for its durable wood, which has been historically used in construction and furniture-making."
