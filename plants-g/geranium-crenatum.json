    "intro": "Geranium crenatum, commonly known as the notched geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features upright stems that are covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are deeply notched, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Geranium crenatum prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
