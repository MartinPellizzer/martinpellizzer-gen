    "intro": "Gastrodia molloyi, commonly known as the Molloy's thunder god, is a rare and unique orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is a myco-heterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrients. The plant produces a single, fleshy, club-shaped pseudobulb that stores energy and water. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and emit a strong, spicy odor to attract insect pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
