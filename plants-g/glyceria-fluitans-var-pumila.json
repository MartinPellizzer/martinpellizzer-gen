    "intro": "Glyceria fluitans var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf floating grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of rivers. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that float on the water's surface, with small, narrow leaves arranged in a spiral pattern. Its flowers are tiny and clustered in spikelets, which are usually submerged or just above the water. This species plays an important role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
