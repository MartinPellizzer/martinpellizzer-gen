    "intro": "Gymnolaema, commonly known as the star orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive star-shaped flowers, which are often brightly colored and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Gymnolaema species are typically epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. They are native to tropical regions of South America, particularly the Amazon basin, where they thrive in humid, shaded environments. The botanical features of Gymnolaema make it an important subject in the study of orchid diversity and ecological interactions."
