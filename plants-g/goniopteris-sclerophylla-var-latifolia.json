    "intro": "Goniopteris sclerophylla var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved rock fern, is a variant of the rock fern genus Goniopteris. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically broad and serrated, adapted to thrive in rocky and arid environments. The plant is native to regions with Mediterranean climates, where it often grows on limestone or sandstone substrates. Its leaves are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 50 centimeters, making it a striking feature in its natural habitat. This fern is well-suited to dry conditions and is often found in coastal or mountainous areas with well-drained soils."
