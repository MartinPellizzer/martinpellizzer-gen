It features upright, branched stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are typically palmately lobed with serrated edges. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of red, pink, or white, which bloom from summer to autumn. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and drought tolerance."
