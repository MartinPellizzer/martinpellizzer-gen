    "intro": "Glinus, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in loose inflorescences. Its seeds are encased in a fleshy, three-lobed capsule that splits open when mature. Glinus is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
