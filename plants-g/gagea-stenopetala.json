    "intro": "Gagea stenopetala, commonly known as the narrow-petaled gagea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. Its bulbs are fleshy and serve as storage organs for nutrients, enabling the plant to survive in harsh alpine conditions. Gagea stenopetala is often found in association with other alpine flora, contributing to the biodiversity of its high-altitude environment."
