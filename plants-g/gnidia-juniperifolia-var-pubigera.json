    "intro": "Gnidia juniperifolia var. pubigera, commonly known as the rough-leaved gnidia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, pubescent foliage that gives it a rough texture. The leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with a prominent midrib and a leathery surface. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas."
