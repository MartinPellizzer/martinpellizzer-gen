    "intro": "Gagea anisopoda, commonly known as the narrow-leaved gagea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like foliage and clustered, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and forest floors. Its bulbs are fleshy and serve as storage organs for nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor soils. The flowering period usually occurs in early spring, adding a delicate floral display to its habitat."
