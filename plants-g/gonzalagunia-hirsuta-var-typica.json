    "intro": "Gonzalagunia hirsuta var. typica, commonly known as the hairy gonzalagunia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which are often covered in fine, soft trichomes. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soils. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native habitat."
