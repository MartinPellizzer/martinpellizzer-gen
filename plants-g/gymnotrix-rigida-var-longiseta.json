    "intro": "Gymnotrix rigida var. longiseta, commonly known as the rigid gymnotrix, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its upright, rigid stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or streamside habitats. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or white, arranged in dense clusters at the tips of the stems. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its texture and aiding in water retention. This variant is distinguished by its longer, more robust setae compared to the typical form of Gymnotrix rigida."
