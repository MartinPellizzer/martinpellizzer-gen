    "intro": "Gamblea longipes, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its enormous, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the water's surface. The plant's thick, spongy petioles provide buoyancy and support for its massive foliage. Its flowers, which are typically white or pale pink, bloom at night and emit a sweet fragrance to attract pollinators. Gamblea longipes plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic life and contributing to water filtration."
