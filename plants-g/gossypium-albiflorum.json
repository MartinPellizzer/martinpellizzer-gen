    "intro": "Gossypium albiflorum, commonly known as the whiteflower cotton, is a species of flowering plant in the mallow family. It is native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico, where it thrives in warm, arid climates. The plant is characterized by its white, showy flowers and fluffy, seed-filled bolls that resemble cotton. It has hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. While not as economically significant as other cotton species, it is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in its native habitat."
