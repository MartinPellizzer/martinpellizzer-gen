    "intro": "Geanthus longipetiolatus, commonly known as the long-petioled bellflower, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the Campanulaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile. The plant is characterized by its elongated petioles, which support its bell-shaped, blue or purple flowers. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cooler, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in the wild."
