    "intro": "Glycine ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty soybean, is a climbing legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces elongated, hairy pods containing several round seeds. Glycine ferruginea is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. It is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
