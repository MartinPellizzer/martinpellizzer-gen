    "intro": "Gesneria saxatilis, commonly known as the rock gesneria, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the humid forests of western Africa. It features broad, leathery leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy coating, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Gesneria saxatilis is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
