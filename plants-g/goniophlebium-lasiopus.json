    "intro": "Goniophlebium lasiopus, commonly known as the rough-stemmed liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its leafy, thalloid structure with a distinctive, rough-textured stem. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. Its leaves are usually arranged in a spiral pattern and are often covered in tiny, raised structures called papillae. Goniophlebium lasiopus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
