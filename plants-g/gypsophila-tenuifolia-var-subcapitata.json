    "intro": "Gypsophila tenuifolia var. subcapitata, commonly known as the slender milkweed or narrow-leaved gypsophila, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its botanical features make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable in its native habitat."
