    "intro": "Gypsophila elata, commonly known as the baby's breath, is a flowering plant native to central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like clusters of small white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 10 to 30 inches and thrives in full sun and well-drained soil. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often overlooked but contribute to its overall appearance. Gypsophila elata is widely used in floral arrangements due to its ability to add a soft, ethereal touch to bouquets."
