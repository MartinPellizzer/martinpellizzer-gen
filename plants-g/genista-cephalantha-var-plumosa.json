    "intro": "Genista cephalantha var. plumosa, commonly known as the plumy genista, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, needle-like leaves that are softly hairy, giving it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for coastal and Mediterranean gardens."
