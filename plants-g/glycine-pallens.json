It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in racemes. Its pods are elongated and contain edible seeds that are used in traditional cuisines. Glycine pallens is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits soil fertility in agricultural settings."
