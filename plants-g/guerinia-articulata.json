    "intro": "Guerinia articulata, commonly known as the African mouse ear, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a succulent perennial that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant features small, fleshy leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink and bloom in summer. Guerinia articulata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact size and drought tolerance."
