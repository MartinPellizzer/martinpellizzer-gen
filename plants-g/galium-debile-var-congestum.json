    "intro": "Galium debile var. congestum, commonly known as the clustered bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features small, opposite, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowering stems are often sprawling and can form dense mats, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing soil."
