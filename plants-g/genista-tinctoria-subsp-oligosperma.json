    "intro": "Genista tinctoria subsp. oligosperma, commonly known as the lesser yellow broom, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and pairs of opposite, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are followed by cylindrical, woody pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in dye production, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
