    "intro": "Galearia lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, which are usually blue or violet in color. Its leaves are lanceolate, hence the species name \"lancifolia,\" and are covered in a fine pubescence. Galearia lancifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
