    "intro": "Geonoma olfersiana, commonly known as the Olfers' fern, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often hidden within the leaf rosette. Geonoma olfersiana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions."
