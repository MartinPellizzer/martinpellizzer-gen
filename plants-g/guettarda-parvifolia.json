    "intro": "Guettarda parvifolia, commonly known as the small-flowered guettarda, is a species of flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and sandy soils. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Guettarda parvifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its hardy nature."
