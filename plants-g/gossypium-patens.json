    "intro": "Gossypium patens, commonly known as the Patagonian cotton, is a species of flowering plant in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It is native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Chile, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves, and it produces small, pale yellow flowers. Its cotton-like fibers are used in traditional textiles by local communities. However, it is less cultivated than other cotton species due to its lower yield and specific environmental requirements."
