    "intro": "Galeopsis pubescens, commonly known as hairy water hemlock, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a biennial or perennial herb that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and roadsides. The plant has slender stems covered in fine hairs and produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a hairy texture, and it is often mistaken for other toxic plants due to its similar appearance. However, it is not as toxic as true water hemlock and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
