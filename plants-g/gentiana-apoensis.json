    "intro": "Gentiana apoensis, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada gentian, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountains in California. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in meadows and along streams. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, adapted to the cool, arid conditions of its habitat. Gentiana apoensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its mountainous environment."
