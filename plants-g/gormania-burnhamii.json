    "intro": "Gormania burnhamii, commonly known as the Burnham's gormania, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep red. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its humid habitat. Gormania burnhamii is known for its limited distribution and is considered a species of conservation concern due to habitat loss and fragmentation."
