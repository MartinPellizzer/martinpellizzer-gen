It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit. The plant features short, stout rhizomes and produces small, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a distinctive, abbreviated shape that gives it its common name. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
