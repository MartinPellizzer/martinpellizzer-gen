    "intro": "Glechoma glabrescens, commonly known as creeping ground-ivy, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces small, blue or purple flowers in early spring. The plant spreads via stolons, forming dense mats that can cover the ground effectively. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Glechoma glabrescens is also known for its medicinal properties, traditionally used to treat respiratory and digestive ailments."
