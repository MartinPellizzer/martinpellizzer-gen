    "intro": "Gasteranthus timidus, commonly known as the shy or timid gloxinia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that are often brightly colored, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. The plant produces fleshy, berry-like structures called gasteria, which are adapted to attract specific pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Gasteranthus timidus is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
