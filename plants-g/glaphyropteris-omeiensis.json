    "intro": "Glaphyropteris omeiensis, commonly known as the Omei fern, is a prehistoric plant belonging to the genus Glaphyropteris, which is part of the order Marattiopsida. It is characterized by its large, complex fronds with a distinctive, often bipinnate structure, indicating a high level of evolutionary development. The plant is primarily known from fossil records, particularly from the late Carboniferous to early Permian periods. Its leaves typically exhibit a broad, feather-like arrangement, suggesting it was a shade-tolerant species. The study of Glaphyropteris omeiensis provides valuable insights into the paleobotany and paleoenvironmental conditions of ancient swamp forests."
