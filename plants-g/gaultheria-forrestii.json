    "intro": "Gaultheria forrestii, commonly known as the Forster's wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of western China. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible and contain a high concentration of methyl salicylate, giving them a peppery taste. Gaultheria forrestii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in acidic, well-drained soils."
