It belongs to the Gentianaceae family, which is known for its showy, often blue or purple flowers. The subspecies is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
