    "intro": "Gentiana prostrata f. imbricata, commonly known as the prostrate gentian, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe. It features small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has a creeping habit, with stems that lie flat on the ground and produce numerous leaves that are lance-shaped and hairy. Its flowers are characterized by five petals that are tightly fused at the base, forming a distinctive, bell-shaped corolla. This subspecies is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
