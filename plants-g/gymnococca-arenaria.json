    "intro": "Gymnococca arenaria, commonly known as sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It has a dense, cushion-like growth habit, which helps it retain moisture and withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant features small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, reducing water loss. It produces clusters of pale yellow to greenish flowers, which are typically borne on short stalks. Gymnococca arenaria is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky habitats."
