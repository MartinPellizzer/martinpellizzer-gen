    "intro": "Gerardia galvesiana, commonly known as the Galveston gerardia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Texas. It is a low-growing perennial with slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand salty air and sandy soils. Gerardia galvesiana plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
