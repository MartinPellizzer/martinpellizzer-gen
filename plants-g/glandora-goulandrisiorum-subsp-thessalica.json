    "intro": "Glandora goulandrisiorum subsp. thessalica, commonly known as the Thessalian glandora, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the mountainous regions of Greece. It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and distinctive floral structures that are adapted to its specific ecological niche. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in subalpine or alpine environments. Its flowers, which are typically pale pink to white, are arranged in dense inflorescences and are pollinated by a variety of insects. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
