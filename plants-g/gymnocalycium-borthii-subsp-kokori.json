    "intro": "Gymnocalycium borthii subsp. kokori, commonly known as the Kokori cactus, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family native to the arid regions of northern Chile. It is characterized by its globose or slightly cylindrical stem that is often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly spines. The plant produces pale yellow flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically in spring. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and cactus enthusiasts. Due to its fragile nature and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
