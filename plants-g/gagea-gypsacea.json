    "intro": "Gagea gypsacea, commonly known as the gypsum gagea, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its bulbs are adapted to store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments. Gagea gypsacea is also noted for its delicate, grass-like foliage and its role in supporting local pollinators."
