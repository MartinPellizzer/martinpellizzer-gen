    "intro": "Galium ruthenicum f. piliferum, commonly known as the silky bedstraw, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. Its flowering stems are usually shorter than the vegetative stems, and the leaves are usually more densely hairy. This form is distinguished by its more pronounced pubescence compared to the typical form of Galium ruthenicum."
