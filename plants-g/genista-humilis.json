    "intro": "Genista humilis, commonly known as the creeping yellow broom, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a vibrant touch to its foliage. The plant has slender, woody stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its leaves are narrow and feather-like, contributing to its overall delicate appearance. Genista humilis is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soils."
