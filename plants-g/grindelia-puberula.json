    "intro": "Grindelia puberula, commonly known as the woolly gumweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as hillsides and grasslands. Grindelia puberula is also known for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional herbal practices."
