It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its slender, branching stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silky hair, contributing to its unique appearance."
