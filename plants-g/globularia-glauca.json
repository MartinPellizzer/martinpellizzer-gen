    "intro": "Globularia glauca, commonly known as blue globularia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, rounded clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage that adds a striking contrast to its floral display. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Globularia glauca is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
