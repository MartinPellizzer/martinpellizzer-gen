    "intro": "Geum geoides, commonly known as marsh cinquefoil, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features basal leaves that are palmately divided into five lobes, with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in early spring, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of stems. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, often saturated soils. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing nectar for early pollinators."
