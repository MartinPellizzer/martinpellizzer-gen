    "intro": "Guzmania izkoi, commonly known as the pink star bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy inflorescence, which features a cluster of pink flowers surrounded by long, strap-like leaves. The plant's rosette of narrow, waxy leaves collects rainwater, creating a micro-ecosystem that supports various small organisms. Guzmania izkoi thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
