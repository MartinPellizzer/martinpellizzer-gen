    "intro": "Geum molle, commonly known as soft avens, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features upright, branching stems covered in soft, fuzzy hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of yellow to red, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately divided, with lobes that are often hairy and slightly toothed. Geum molle thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks."
