    "intro": "Goniophlebium moupinense, commonly known as the Moupin fern, is a rare and distinctive member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its intricate fronds with a unique pattern of veins that give it a striking appearance. Native to the mountainous regions of China, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
