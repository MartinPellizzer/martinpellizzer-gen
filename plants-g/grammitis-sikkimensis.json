    "intro": "Grammitis sikkimensis, commonly known as the Sikkim chain fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to the Himalayan region. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on trees in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a distinctive, compact rosette of lance-shaped, glossy leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, hair-like structures. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Grammitis sikkimensis plays an important ecological role in its ecosystem by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for various small organisms."
