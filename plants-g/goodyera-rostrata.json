    "intro": "Goodyera rostrata, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, strap-like leaves and a distinctive pink or purple flower with a deep, spurred lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, often on decaying wood or mossy substrates. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it reproduces through seeds or vegetative propagation. Goodyera rostrata is an ephemeral plant, often blooming briefly in early spring before the foliage dies back."
