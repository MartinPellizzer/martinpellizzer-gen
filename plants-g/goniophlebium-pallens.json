    "intro": "Goniophlebium pallens, commonly known as the pale-veined liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, mat-forming liverwort that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a thallus with distinct lobes and pale green coloration, and its leaves are usually arranged in a spiral pattern. G. pallens lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a flattened, ribbon-like structure called a thallus. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporophytes."
