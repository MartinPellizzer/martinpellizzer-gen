    "intro": "Galium chloroionanthum, commonly known as the coastal bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features slender, prostrate stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, elliptic to ovate, and have a slightly hairy surface. Galium chloroionanthum is adapted to sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal scrub and dune environments."
