    "intro": "Guapeba psammophila, commonly known as the sand flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the sandy soils of southern Africa. It typically grows in open, dry habitats such as coastal dunes and sandy plains, where it thrives in well-drained conditions. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets. Its root system is adapted to stabilize loose sand and prevent erosion. Guapeba psammophila plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its arid environment."
