    "intro": "Galium brunneum, commonly known as brown bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, opposite leaves that are typically oval to elliptic in shape, with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. Its fruit is a dry, two-lobed capsule that contains several small seeds. Galium brunneum is often found in moist meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
