    "intro": "Gonianthes, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with long, slender leaves and striking, pale pink or white flowers. The plant lacks roots in the traditional sense and instead absorbs nutrients through its leaves, which are adapted for aerial growth. Gonianthes thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found growing on trees or rocks in the understory of dense forests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its range."
