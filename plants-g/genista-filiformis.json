    "intro": "Genista filiformis, commonly known as the narrowleaf broom, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in ecological restoration projects."
