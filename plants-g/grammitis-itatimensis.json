    "intro": "Grammitis itatimensis, commonly known as the Itatim fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes and small, clustered fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The leaves are usually dichotomously divided, with a delicate, feathery appearance, and they often exhibit a bluish-green hue. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
