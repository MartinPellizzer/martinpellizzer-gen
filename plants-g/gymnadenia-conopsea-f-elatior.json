    "intro": "Gymnadenia conopsea f. elatior, commonly known as the greater purple orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to Europe. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is a perennial herb that thrives in moist, calcareous soils, often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its flowers are typically arranged in a dense spike, with a distinctive lip that is often darker in color. This orchid is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements."
