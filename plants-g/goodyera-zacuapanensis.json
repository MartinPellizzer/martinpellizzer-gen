    "intro": "Goodyera zacuapanensis, commonly known as the Zacuapan orchid, is a species of epiphytic plant native to Central America. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its dense, rosette-like growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
