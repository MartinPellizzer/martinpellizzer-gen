    "intro": "Galium uruguayense var. echinulatum, commonly known as the Uruguay bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Uruguay and parts of Argentina. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant features opposite, oval-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces, and its stems are often covered in fine, glandular hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
