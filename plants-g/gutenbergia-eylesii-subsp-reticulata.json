    "intro": "Gutenbergia eylesii subsp. reticulata, commonly known as the reticulate Gutenbergia, is a rare and distinctive member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is native to New Zealand and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
