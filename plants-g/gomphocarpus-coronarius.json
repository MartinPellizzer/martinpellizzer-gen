It is characterized by its striking, hairy stems and showy yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels. The plant produces distinctive, crown-like seed pods that split open when mature, releasing small, hairy seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Gomphocarpus coronarius is a member of the Apocynaceae family, which includes many milkweed species known for their toxic alkaloids."
