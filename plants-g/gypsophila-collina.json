    "intro": "Gypsophila collina, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to harsh alpine environments. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces numerous tiny flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Gypsophila collina is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in garden settings."
