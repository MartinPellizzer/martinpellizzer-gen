    "intro": "Gaultheria urceolata, commonly known as the evergreen wintergreen, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dense, leathery evergreen leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are edible for humans and birds. Gaultheria urceolata thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its use in traditional herbal medicine."
