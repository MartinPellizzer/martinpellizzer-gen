    "intro": "Geboscon inodorum, commonly known as the scentless gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Despite its lack of fragrance, the plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
