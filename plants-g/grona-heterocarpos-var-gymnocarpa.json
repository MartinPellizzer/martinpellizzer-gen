    "intro": "Grona heterocarpos var. gymnocarpa, commonly known as the smooth-seeded grona, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is native to the Andes mountains of South America, where it thrives in high-altitude, temperate climates. The plant features slender, hollow stems and compound leaves with finely divided lobes, contributing to its ornamental value. Its flowers, which bloom in late summer, are white to pale yellow and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a dry, two-lobed schizocarp, typical of the Apiaceae family, and contains small, hard seeds."
