    "intro": "Geonoma simplicifrons, commonly known as the simple-fruited geonoma, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that often have a waxy coating. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Geonoma simplicifrons is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
