    "intro": "Galium palustre var. humifusum, commonly known as swamp milkweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers clustered in umbels, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. This variant is closely related to other Galium species but is distinguished by its habitat preference and morphological characteristics."
