    "intro": "Galium sylvestre var. nevadense, commonly known as the Sierra bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly found in alpine and subalpine regions. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, often hairy stems that are usually prostrate or ascending. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The species is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in mountainous habitats."
