    "intro": "Gentianodes urnula, commonly known as the urn-shaped gentian, is a striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The flowers have five petals that are fused at the base, forming a tubular shape that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies."
