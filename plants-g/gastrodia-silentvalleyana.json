    "intro": "Gastrodia silentvalleyana, commonly known as the Silent Valley orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively in the Western Ghats of India. It is a myco-heterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrition. The plant produces small, yellowish-brown pseudobulbs and has a unique underground structure that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soil. It flowers during the monsoon season, typically between July and September, and is highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, it is considered critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
