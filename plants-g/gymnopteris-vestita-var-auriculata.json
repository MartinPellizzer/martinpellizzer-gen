    "intro": "Gymnopteris vestita var. auriculata, commonly known as the auriculate shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often adorned with auriculate (ear-shaped) lobes along the margins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters. The fronds are pinnately divided, with a delicate, feathery appearance that contributes to its ornamental value in horticulture."
