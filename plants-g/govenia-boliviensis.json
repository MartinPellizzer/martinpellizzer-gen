    "intro": "Govenia boliviensis, commonly known as the Bolivian evergreen, is a rare shrub native to the high-altitude regions of Bolivia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid climates. Its small, bell-shaped flowers are usually pink or white, and it produces dark blue or black berries. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Govenia boliviensis is considered a vulnerable species."
