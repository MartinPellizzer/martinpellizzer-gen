    "intro": "Gilia dichotoma var. integra, commonly known as the desert gilia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils. The plant produces striking clusters of bright red, pink, or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also an important food source for pollinators like bees and butterflies."
