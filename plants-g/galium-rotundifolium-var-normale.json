    "intro": "Galium rotundifolium var. normale, commonly known as roundleaf bedstraw, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It features small, rounded leaves that are often hairy and arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in early summer. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in suitable habitats."
