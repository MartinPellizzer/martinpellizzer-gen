    "intro": "Glyceria striata subsp. difformis, commonly known as the variable flatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to eastern North America. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has slender, somewhat flattened stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slight sheen, and it is characterized by its variability in leaf and inflorescence morphology. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in moist environments."
