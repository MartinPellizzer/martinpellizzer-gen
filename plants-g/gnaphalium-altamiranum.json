It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, fluffy white to pale yellow flowers that are often used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature. It thrives in dry, sunny conditions and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its scientific name honors the Brazilian botanist and physician, Dr. Altamirano, who contributed to the study of South American flora."
