    "intro": "Galium trifidum var. subbiflorum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender stems and small, opposite leaves that are usually divided into three parts. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are followed by small, bladder-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal."
