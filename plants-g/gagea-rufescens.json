    "intro": "Gagea rufescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed spring beauty, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist, open woodlands and meadows, preferring well-drained soils. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are clustered in umbels. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a reddish tinge, contributing to its common name. Gagea rufescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
