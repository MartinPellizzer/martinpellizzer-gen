    "intro": "Genista albida var. pontica, commonly known as the Pontic yellowbriar, is a flowering shrub native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and along coastal areas. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
