    "intro": "Geniostoma sarasinii, commonly known as the Sarasin's rock orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, intricately shaped flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its flowering period occurs during the late spring to early summer months. Due to its limited habitat and susceptibility to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
