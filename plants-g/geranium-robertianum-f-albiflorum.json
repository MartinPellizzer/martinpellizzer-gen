    "intro": "Geranium robertianum f. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered cranesbill, is a botanical variant of the common geranium. It is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind, contributing to its natural distribution. This variety is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments."
