    "intro": "Geitonoplesium montanum, commonly known as the mountain starfruit, is a climbing shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by orange to red berries that contain several seeds. Its fruit is edible and resembles a starfruit in appearance, though it is less commonly cultivated than the more famous Carambola. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments in tropical and subtropical regions."
