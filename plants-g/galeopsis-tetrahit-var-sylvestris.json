    "intro": "Galeopsis tetrahit var. sylvestris, commonly known as the wild blueweed, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, blue to violet flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, while the plant produces small, four-lobed fruits called nutlets. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as fields and woodland edges, and is often found in disturbed soils. This variety is distinguished from the typical Galeopsis tetrahit by its more robust growth and slightly different floral characteristics."
