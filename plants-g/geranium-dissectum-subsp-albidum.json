    "intro": "Geranium dissectum subsp. albidum, commonly known as the white geranium, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features delicate, dissected leaves that are often silvery-white underneath, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink to white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
