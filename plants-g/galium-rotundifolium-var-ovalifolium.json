    "intro": "Galium rotundifolium var. ovalifolium, commonly known as roundleaf bedstraw, is a perennial herb native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces tiny white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its hairy stems and clustered leaves make it easily distinguishable from other similar species."
