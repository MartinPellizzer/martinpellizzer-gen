    "intro": "Gouania pubidisca, commonly known as the hairy gouania, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. Its small, clustered flowers are typically white or pale yellow, and it produces small, round berries as fruit. Gouania pubidisca is primarily of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitats."
