    "intro": "Goniopteris malacothrix, commonly known as the Malacothrix water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes, where it can receive adequate sunlight. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. The plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
