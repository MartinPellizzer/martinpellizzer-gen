    "intro": "Galium baldensiforme, commonly known as the slender bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense mats of prostrate stems covered with fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy surface. Galium baldensiforme is adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
