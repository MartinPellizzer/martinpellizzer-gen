It is characterized by its striking, showy clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. It has slender, branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
