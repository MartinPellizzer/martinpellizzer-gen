    "intro": "Ginkgo biloba var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed ginkgo, is a variant of the ginkgo tree characterized by its wider, more rounded leaves compared to the standard ginkgo. This variety is native to China and is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its distinctive fan-shaped foliage. The leaves turn a striking yellow in autumn, making it a popular choice for urban landscaping. It is a deciduous tree that thrives in a variety of soil types and is highly tolerant of pollution, making it well-suited for city environments. The plant is also noted for its ability to produce viable seeds, although these are encased in a fleshy, malodorous outer layer."
