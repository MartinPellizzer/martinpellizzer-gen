    "intro": "Glossanthus zeylanicus, commonly known as the Ceylon sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Sri Lanka. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood that is highly valued in perfumery and traditional medicine. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a waxy surface. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits containing smooth, black seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species and is protected in its native habitat."
