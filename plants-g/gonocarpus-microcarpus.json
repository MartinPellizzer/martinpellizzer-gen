    "intro": "Gonocarpus microcarpus, commonly known as the small-fruited gonocarpus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and palmate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as riverbanks and swampy areas. Due to its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its potential medicinal properties, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
