    "intro": "Galactia albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered milkvetch, is a herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the legume family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert scrub habitats. Galactia albiflora is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it ecologically significant in nutrient-poor environments."
