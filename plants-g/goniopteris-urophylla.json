    "intro": "Goniopteris urophylla, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically broad and undulating, with a distinctive, wavy margin. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of roots, which help anchor it to moist soil or rock surfaces. The fronds are usually bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
