    "intro": "Gleditsia heterophylla, commonly known as the Chinese honeylocust, is a deciduous tree native to China and parts of Korea. It is characterized by its compound leaves that change shape along the stem, with upper leaves being trifoliate and lower ones being pinnate. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in racemes, which are followed by flat, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and tolerance to urban conditions. The tree has a shallow root system, making it suitable for small spaces but potentially problematic in certain landscapes."
