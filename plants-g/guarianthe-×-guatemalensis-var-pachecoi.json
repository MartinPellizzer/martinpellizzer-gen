    "intro": "Guarianthe \u00d7 guatemalensis var. pachecoi, commonly known as the Guatemalan orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature vibrant colors such as red, orange, and yellow. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, tropical climates with high light exposure and well-draining substrates. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
