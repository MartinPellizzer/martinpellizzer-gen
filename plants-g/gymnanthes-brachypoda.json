    "intro": "Gymnanthes brachypoda, commonly known as the short-stemmed gymnanthes, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes a diverse group of plants known for their milky sap and often showy flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female structures, a common feature in many members of the Euphorbiaceae family. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, contributing to its dispersal in the wild."
