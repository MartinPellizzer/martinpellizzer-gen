    "intro": "Geranium cuneatum subsp. cuneatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf geranium, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring upright stems and lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to red flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
