    "intro": "Galenia papulosa var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved galenia, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, fleshy, and often hairy leaves that are smaller than those of the typical variety. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its succulent leaves help it store water, adapting it to arid environments. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
