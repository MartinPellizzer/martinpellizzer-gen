    "intro": "Galium musyaense, commonly known as the Musyaense bedstraw, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Galium musyaense is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and it has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in rocky or clay soils."
