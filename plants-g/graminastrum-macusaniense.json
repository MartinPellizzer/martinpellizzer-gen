    "intro": "Graminastrum macusaniense, commonly known as the Macusani grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high Andes of Peru. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the grass family. It thrives in cool, high-altitude environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
