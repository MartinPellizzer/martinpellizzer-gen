    "intro": "Gypsophila uralensis, commonly known as the Siberian snowball, is a flowering plant native to the cold regions of Siberia and Central Asia. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of small, white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Its delicate appearance contrasts with its hardy nature, allowing it to survive in extreme climates. Gypsophila uralensis is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and winter interest."
