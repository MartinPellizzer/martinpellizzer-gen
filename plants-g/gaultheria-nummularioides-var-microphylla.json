    "intro": "Gaultheria nummularioides var. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf snowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, rounded, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in late spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
