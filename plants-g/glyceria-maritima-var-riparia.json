    "intro": "Glyceria maritima var. riparia, commonly known as river glyceria, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and riparian habitats. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils along rivers, lakes, and marshes. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This variety is adapted to fluctuating water levels and is an important component of aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems."
