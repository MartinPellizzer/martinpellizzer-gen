    "intro": "Glechoma olgae, commonly known as Creeping Jenny, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic plants. The plant features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in the early summer. Glechoma olgae thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rapid growth and spreading habit make it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in certain habitats."
