It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and hairy, glandular leaves that give it a sticky texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom during the spring and summer months. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and shrublands. Goodenia viscida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
