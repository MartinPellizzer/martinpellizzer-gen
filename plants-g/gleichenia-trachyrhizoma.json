    "intro": "Gleichenia trachyrhizoma, commonly known as the rough-stemmed Gleichenia, is a fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is characterized by its long, creeping rhizomes and fronds that are typically divided into pairs of pinnae. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests. Its structure and reproductive features make it a typical example of a primitive fern."
