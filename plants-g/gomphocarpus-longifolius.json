    "intro": "Gomphocarpus longifolius, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. The plant contains milky sap, which can be toxic if ingested, making it important to handle with care."
