    "intro": "Gonolobus membranaceus, commonly known as the narrowleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a climbing vine with heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of blue, purple, and white. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a fibrous, membranous covering. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
