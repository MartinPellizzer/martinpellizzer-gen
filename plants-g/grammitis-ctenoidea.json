    "intro": "Grammitis ctenoidea, commonly known as the feather moss, is a type of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, carpet-like growth habit and small, closely packed leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a distinct, feather-like appearance, which contributes to its common name. Grammitis ctenoidea plays an important ecological role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its habitat."
