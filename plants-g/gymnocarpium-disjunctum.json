    "intro": "Gymnocarpium disjunctum, commonly known as the disjointed bladder-arnold, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces distinctive, bladder-like fruits that are naked, meaning they lack a protective covering. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Gymnocarpium disjunctum is native to North America and is often found in the eastern United States."
