    "intro": "Grammitis subcoriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are often covered with a rough, scaly texture. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its rhizomes while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain water in humid environments. Grammitis subcoriacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, moist gardens."
