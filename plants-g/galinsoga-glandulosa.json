    "intro": "Galinsoga glandulosa, commonly known as sticky beggarticks, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves with glandular dots that secrete a sticky substance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early fall. Its seeds are small and covered in fine hairs, which aid in wind dispersal. Galinsoga glandulosa is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
