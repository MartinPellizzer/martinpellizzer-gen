    "intro": "Gastronema sanguineum, commonly known as the bloodroot plant, is a flowering plant native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking red-orange flowers that bloom in spring, often emerging from a basal rosette of waxy, dark green leaves. The plant has a short, stout stem that supports its showy inflorescence, which consists of clustered, tubular flowers. Its leaves are thick and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in its native environment. Gastronema sanguineum is also notable for its medicinal properties, with various parts of the plant used in traditional remedies."
