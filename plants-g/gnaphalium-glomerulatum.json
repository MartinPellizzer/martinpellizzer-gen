    "intro": "Gnaphalium glomerulatum, commonly known as clustered feather grass, is a herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy clusters of small, white to pale yellow florets that give it a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Gnaphalium glomerulatum is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
