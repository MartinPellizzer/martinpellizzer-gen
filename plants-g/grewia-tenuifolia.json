    "intro": "Grewia tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed globemallow, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds. Grewia tenuifolia is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions."
