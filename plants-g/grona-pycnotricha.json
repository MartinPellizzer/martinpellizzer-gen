    "intro": "Grona pycnotricha, commonly known as the woolly forest fern, is a perennial plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it its common name, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by spore-bearing structures called sori. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly through the forest floor, forming dense mats. Grona pycnotricha plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small forest organisms."
