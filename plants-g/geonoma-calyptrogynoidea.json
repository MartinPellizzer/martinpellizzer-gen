    "intro": "Geonoma calyptrogynoidea, commonly known as the hidden female fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit. The plant features fronds that are typically short and broad, with a dense arrangement of small, clustered leaves. Its spore-producing structures are concealed beneath the leaf surface, a unique adaptation that gives it its common name. Geonoma calyptrogynoidea is often found in shaded, humid environments such as forest understories."
