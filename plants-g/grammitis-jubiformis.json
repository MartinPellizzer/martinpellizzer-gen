    "intro": "Grammitis jubiformis, commonly known as the golden grammitis, is a species of liverwort that belongs to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, foliose thallus that forms a carpet-like growth on rocks and soil. The plant exhibits a distinctive yellow-green coloration due to the presence of chlorophyll and other pigments. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Grammitis jubiformis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
