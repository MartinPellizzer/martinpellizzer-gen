It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant features showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. The leaves are usually alternate and have a rough texture, adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong winds."
