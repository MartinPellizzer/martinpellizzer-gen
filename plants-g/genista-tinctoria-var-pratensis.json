    "intro": "Genista tinctoria var. pratensis, commonly known as yellow broom, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, forming dense clusters along the stems. The plant has slender, wiry branches and small, leathery leaves that are alternate in arrangement. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and woodland edges. This variety is closely related to other members of the Genista genus, which are known for their ornamental value and historical use in dye production."
