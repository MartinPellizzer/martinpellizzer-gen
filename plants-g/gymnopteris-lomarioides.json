    "intro": "Gymnopteris lomarioides, commonly known as the slender fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically arching or ascending. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with the rhizome often covered in a thick layer of sori. Its leaves are usually green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in humid environments. Gymnopteris lomarioides is often found in shaded, moist areas such as forests and rocky outcrops."
