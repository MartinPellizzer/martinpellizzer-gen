    "intro": "Gaudinopsis macra var. quercetorum, commonly known as the Quercetum gaudinopsis, is a variant of the Gaudinopsis macra species native to specific regions of South America. It is a shrub characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, rounded leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and forest edges. Due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
