    "intro": "Gonatopus boivinii var. lanceolatus, commonly known as the lanceolate moon cactus, is a striking hybrid plant that combines the vibrant colors of the *Gonatopus* genus with the unique shape of the *Selenicereus* species. It is characterized by its swollen, fleshy stem that resembles a moon, often displaying bright red, orange, or yellow hues. The plant produces small, white flowers during the night, a trait inherited from its *Selenicereus* parent. It thrives in warm, sunny conditions with well-draining soil and requires minimal water. Due to its ornamental value, it is popular among cactus enthusiasts and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant."
