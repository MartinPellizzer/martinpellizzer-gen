    "intro": "Glycine aphyonotos, commonly known as the white bean vine, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces elongated, bean-like pods that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional cuisines. Glycine aphyonotos thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in moist woodlands or along riverbanks. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it a common ornamental and agricultural plant in suitable environments."
