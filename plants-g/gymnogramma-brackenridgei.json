    "intro": "Gymnogramma brackenridgei, commonly known as the Brackenridge's holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of its leaves. Gymnogramma brackenridgei thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
