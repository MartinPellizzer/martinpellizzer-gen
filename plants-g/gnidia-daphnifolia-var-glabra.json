    "intro": "Gnidia daphnifolia var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth gnidia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically smooth and leathery in texture. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers arranged in composite heads, which are often clustered together. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly encountered in its natural wild state."
