    "intro": "Goniopteris equitans, commonly known as the equine fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a unique arrangement of pinnae that resemble the shape of a horse's head. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, a feature common among ferns. Goniopteris equitans is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
