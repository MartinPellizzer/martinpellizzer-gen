    "intro": "Glechoma racemosa, commonly known as creeping Jenny, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, fragrant blue or purple flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant spreads rapidly through rhizomes and stolons, forming dense mats that can colonize moist, shady areas. It is often found in woodland floors, stream banks, and other damp environments. Its medicinal properties have been historically used in traditional herbal remedies."
