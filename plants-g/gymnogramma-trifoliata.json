    "intro": "Gymnogramma trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate (three-lobed) fronds that are typically leathery and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters known as sori. Gymnogramma trifoliata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
