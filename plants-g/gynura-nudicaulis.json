    "intro": "Gynura nudicaulis, commonly known as the velvetleaf or small-leaved gynura, is a herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy, ovate leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, spiny fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Gynura nudicaulis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
