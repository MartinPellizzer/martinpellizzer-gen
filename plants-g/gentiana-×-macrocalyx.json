    "intro": "Gentiana \u00d7 macrocalyx, commonly known as the large-flowered gentian, is a hybrid perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
