    "intro": "Grammitis albosetosa, commonly known as the white-hairy fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are covered in a dense layer of white, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are surrounded by a protective indusium. Grammitis albosetosa is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in high humidity and indirect light."
