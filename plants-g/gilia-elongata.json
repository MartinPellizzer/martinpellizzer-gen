It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of showy, pink to red flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its flowers are tubular with two lips, and it produces small, oval seeds in follicles. Gilia elongata is an important nectar source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
