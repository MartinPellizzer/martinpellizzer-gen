    "intro": "Galearia, commonly known as the mountain heath, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. These plants are typically found in alpine and subalpine regions, thriving in cool, moist environments. Galearia species are characterized by their evergreen foliage and small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plants often grow in dense mats or low shrubs, forming an important component of mountain ecosystems. They are well adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can withstand harsh weather conditions."
