    "intro": "Goodenia psammophila subsp. hiddinsiana, commonly known as the sandplain goodenia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It typically features wiry stems and small, clustered leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple, attracting nectar-feeding insects. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as coastal dunes and inland plains. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
