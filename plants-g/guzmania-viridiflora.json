    "intro": "Guzmania viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences with greenish-white bracts, which are often mistaken for flowers. Its foliage is typically dark green with a waxy texture, and it thrives in bright, indirect light with high humidity. Guzmania viridiflora is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
