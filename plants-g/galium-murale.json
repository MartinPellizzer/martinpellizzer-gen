    "intro": "Galium murale, commonly known as wall gecko or mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its small, opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. Galium murale is typically found in moist, shaded areas such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a common sight in temperate regions."
