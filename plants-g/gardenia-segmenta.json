    "intro": "Gardenia segmenta, commonly known as the segmented gardenia, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often deeply lobed or segmented, giving it its common name. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a woody capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Gardenia segmenta prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in warm climates."
