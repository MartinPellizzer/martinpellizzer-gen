    "intro": "Gastrochilus matsudae var. hoi, commonly known as the Hoi's gastrochilus, is a rare orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its flowers are zygomorphic, with a distinct lip that serves as a landing platform for pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
