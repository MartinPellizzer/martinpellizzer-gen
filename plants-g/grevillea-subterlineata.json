    "intro": "Grevillea subterlineata, commonly known as the pink-leafed grevillea, is a striking shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant pink to red color, which stand out against its grey-green stems. The plant produces striking, bottlebrush-like flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often cultivated in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
