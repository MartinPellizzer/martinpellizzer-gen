    "intro": "Galium glabricarpum, commonly known as smooth-fruited bedstraw, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers, which are typically borne in dense, rounded inflorescences. Its fruits are dry, dehiscent capsules that release tiny seeds when mature. Galium glabricarpum is often found in moist, disturbed soils in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
