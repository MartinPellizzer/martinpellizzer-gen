    "intro": "Grammitis cordata var. pinnatopinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It features slender, creeping rhizomes and produces dense, dark green, leathery fronds with a distinctive, finely divided, pinnatifid appearance. The fronds are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and the plant lacks true leaves, instead having specialized structures called phyllodes. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. The plant's intricate leaf structure and adaptability to epiphytic life make it a notable example of fern diversity in tropical ecosystems."
