    "intro": "Gentiana prostrata var. subacaulis, commonly known as the prostrate gentian, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features a mat-forming growth habit with short, creeping stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers during the summer months, which are typically tubular in shape and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
