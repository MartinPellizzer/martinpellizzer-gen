    "intro": "Gaultheria longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are elliptical, leathery, and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the colorful flowers. Gaultheria longipes is also valued for its aromatic leaves, which contain compounds used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
