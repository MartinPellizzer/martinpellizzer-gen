    "intro": "Galium sylvaticum, commonly known as wood sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive veining pattern, and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shady, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Galium sylvaticum is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora in forest understories."
