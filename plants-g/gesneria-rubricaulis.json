    "intro": "Gesneria rubricaulis, commonly known as the red-stemmed gesneria, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It features lance-shaped leaves that are dark green with a reddish or purplish hue on the underside, giving it a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically blooming during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Gesneria rubricaulis is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
