It is characterized by its globose, spiny stems that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. It is a drought-tolerant plant adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Gymnocalycium deeszianum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in low-water conditions."
