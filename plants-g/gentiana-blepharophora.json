    "intro": "Gentiana blepharophora, commonly known as the veined gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The genus Gentiana is known for its showy flowers and is part of the family Gentianaceae, which includes many species with medicinal and ornamental value."
