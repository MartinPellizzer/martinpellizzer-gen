    "intro": "Geranium sibiricum f. glabrius, commonly known as the smooth-leaved Siberian geranium, is a flowering plant native to the cold regions of Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
