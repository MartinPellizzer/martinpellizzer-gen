    "intro": "Gymnocalycium ochoterenae var. variispinum, commonly known as the variable spine cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is a low-growing, compact cactus with a globular or cylindrical shape, often covered in dense, white to pale green spines. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically nocturnal in bloom. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in succulent gardens."
