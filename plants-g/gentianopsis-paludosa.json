    "intro": "Gentianopsis paludosa, commonly known as the marsh gentian, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and swampy areas. The plant features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, and the stems are usually unbranched and hairy. Gentianopsis paludosa plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for native wildlife."
