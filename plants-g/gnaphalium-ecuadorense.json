    "intro": "Gnaphalium ecuadorense, commonly known as the Ecuadorian everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant produces a fine, white, powdery substance called myrrh, which is released from its leaves and flowers. It thrives in high-altitude environments and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its aromatic properties, it has been used traditionally in local medicine and as a source of natural perfumes."
