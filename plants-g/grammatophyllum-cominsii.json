It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences that resemble spiders, with long, thin petals and a distinctive, elongated lip. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of light for optimal growth. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, such as flies and beetles, due to their unique coloration and scent.
