    "intro": "Gonostemon macowanii var. abrasus, commonly known as the rough-stemmed gonostemon, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in rough, sometimes hairy texture, and its small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow. The plant thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. This species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
