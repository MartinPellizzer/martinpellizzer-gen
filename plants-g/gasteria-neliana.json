    "intro": "Gasteria neliana, commonly known as the Natal bulbous plant, is a succulent perennial native to South Africa. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, dark green leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers on tall, slender stems during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and requiring minimal watering. Gasteria neliana is popular as an ornamental plant due to its compact size and attractive foliage."
