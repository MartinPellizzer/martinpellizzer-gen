    "intro": "Goodyera pubescens var. minor, commonly known as the lesser velvet fern, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically growing on the trunks of trees in forest understories. The plant features small, leathery leaves covered in fine, soft hairs, which help retain moisture in its moist, tropical habitat. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with a unique, spurred shape typical of the orchid family. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for undisturbed forest ecosystems."
