    "intro": "Galium cespitosum, commonly known as common bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in early summer. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and usually oval or lance-shaped with hairy surfaces. Galium cespitosum is often found in moist, disturbed soils along roadsides, streambanks, and woodland edges."
