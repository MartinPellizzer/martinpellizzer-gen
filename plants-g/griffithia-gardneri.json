    "intro": "Griffithia gardneri, commonly known as the Australian pine, is a species of conifer native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and distinctive, scale-like leaves that are arranged in spirals. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Griffithia gardneri thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often forming dense stands in disturbed areas. Due to its rapid growth and ecological impact, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range."
