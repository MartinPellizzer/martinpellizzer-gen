    "intro": "Geonoma porteana, commonly known as the Brazilian sword fern, is a species of fern native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its lanceolate, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to moist soil or rocky substrates. Geonoma porteana plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various small organisms."
