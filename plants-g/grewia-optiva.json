    "intro": "Grewia optiva, commonly known as the red gum tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible and often consumed by birds and mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid regions. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture with a glossy appearance."
