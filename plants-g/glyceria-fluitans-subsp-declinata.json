    "intro": "Glyceria fluitans subsp. declinata, commonly known as the bentgrass of the marshes, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in temperate regions. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. The plant has slender, creeping stems that form dense mats, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly curled. Its small, spike-like inflorescence bears numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This subspecies is adapted to fluctuating water levels and is an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems."
