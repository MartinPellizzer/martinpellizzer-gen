    "intro": "Glandularia aristigera, commonly known as the narrowleaf glandularia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy, glandular leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in arid and semi-arid regions. Its leaves are narrow and covered with tiny, glandular hairs that secrete substances, possibly for defense against herbivores. The flowers are usually pink to purple in color and bloom in late spring to early summer."
