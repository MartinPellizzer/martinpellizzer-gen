    "intro": "Girardinia suborbiculata subsp. triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed rock cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, lobed leaves that are typically green to bluish-gray in color. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
