    "intro": "Gonatopus, commonly known as the common water lily, is a genus of aquatic plants native to temperate regions. It features floating leaves with a waxy upper surface and showy, fragrant flowers that open during the day. The plant's roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of ponds and lakes. Its leaves are broad and rounded, often with a notched or lobed shape. Gonatopus plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water life."
