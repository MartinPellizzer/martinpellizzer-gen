    "intro": "Gonocarpus hexander, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical plant native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its distinctive red, corky bark and its ability to thrive in saline water, making it a key species in coastal ecosystems. The plant has aerial roots that help it anchor in soft, waterlogged soils and facilitate gas exchange. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in green or red clusters, and it produces woody, spherical fruits. Gonocarpus hexander plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
