It is characterized by its dense, spiny growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves and produces small, pod-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
