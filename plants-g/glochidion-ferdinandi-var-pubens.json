    "intro": "Glochidion ferdinandi var. pubens, commonly known as the hairy glochidion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine, short hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers, which are typically inconspicuous and not showy. It is native to tropical regions of Asia, including parts of India and Southeast Asia, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The hairy glochidion is often found in lowland forests and is valued for its ornamental foliage rather than its flowers."
