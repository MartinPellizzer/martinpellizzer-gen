    "intro": "Gymnadenia orchidis, commonly known as the grass pinks, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their slender, grass-like leaves and showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. They are native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia, often found in meadows and grassy habitats. Gymnadenia orchidis species typically have a short rootstock and produce a single spike of flowers, which are often fragrant. The genus is notable for its ecological importance, supporting various pollinators and contributing to biodiversity in grassland ecosystems."
