    "intro": "Gagea reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed gagea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in woodland and rocky habitats, preferring well-drained soils. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. Gagea reflexa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
