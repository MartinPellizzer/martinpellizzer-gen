    "intro": "Glochidion roseum, commonly known as the red-leaf glochidion, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves that are often reddish in color, especially when young. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by elliptical, orange-red fruits. Glochidion roseum is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
