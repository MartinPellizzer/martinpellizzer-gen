    "intro": "Gonystylus miquelianus, commonly known as the Miquel's ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and evergreen foliage. The plant typically grows in lowland and hill forests, thriving in humid, warm climates. Its flowers are small and clustered, often white or pale yellow, while its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. Due to its slow growth and high value for timber, it is considered an endangered species in many regions."
