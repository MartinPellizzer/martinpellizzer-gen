    "intro": "Gynampsis, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to three meters in diameter, floating on the surface of still water. The plant's flowers are showy, with vibrant pink or purple petals that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its roots anchor it in the muddy bottom of lakes and ponds, while its leaves provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. Gynampsis plays an important ecological role in maintaining water quality and supporting biodiversity in its native habitats."
