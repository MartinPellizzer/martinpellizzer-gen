    "intro": "Gnaphalium glabrescens, commonly known as the silky weed or silverweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, soft, gray-green foliage covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and disturbed sites. Its aromatic leaves and rapid growth make it a useful plant for erosion control and habitat restoration."
