    "intro": "Gumira procumbens, commonly known as the creeping gumira, is a low-growing perennial plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features wiry,\u530d\u5310 (creeping) stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and have a rough texture. Gumira procumbens is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
