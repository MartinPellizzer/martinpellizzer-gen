    "intro": "Geocaryum pindicola, commonly known as the Mediterranean dwarf lichen, is a member of the Lecanoraceae family. It is a crustose lichen that forms a dense, tightly adherent growth on rock surfaces, typically in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant's thallus is composed of a symbiotic association between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to survive in harsh conditions. It is often found on limestone and other calcareous substrates, contributing to soil formation and nutrient cycling. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in Mediterranean ecosystems."
