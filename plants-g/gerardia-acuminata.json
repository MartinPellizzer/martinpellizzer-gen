    "intro": "Gerardia acuminata, commonly known as the sharp-pointed gerardia, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and coastal areas, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions of its habitat. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The small, yellowish flowers bloom in the summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
