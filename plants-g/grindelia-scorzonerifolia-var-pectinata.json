    "intro": "Grindelia scorzonerifolia var. pectinata, commonly known as the pectinate globemallow, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, branching stems and broad, pinnately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces yellowish to greenish flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, which are typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves and stems contain a resinous substance that gives the plant a distinctive, sometimes aromatic, scent. This variety is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub environments."
