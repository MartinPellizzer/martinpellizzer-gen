It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its compact, clumping growth habit. The plants typically have slender, erect stems covered in a fine layer of hairs. Gazachloa species are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments. They produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds."
