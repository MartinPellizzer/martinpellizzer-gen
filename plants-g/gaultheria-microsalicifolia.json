    "intro": "Gaultheria microsalicifolia, commonly known as the dwarf waxleaf wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features small, elliptical leaves with a waxy, dark green surface that provides a striking visual contrast to its white or pinkish flowers. The plant produces tiny, fragrant berries that are edible for humans and serve as a food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Gaultheria microsalicifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to contribute to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
