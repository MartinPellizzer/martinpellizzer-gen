    "intro": "Gossypium hirsutum var. marie-galante, commonly known as Marie-Galante cotton, is a variant of upland cotton native to the Caribbean island of Marie-Galante. This variety is characterized by its fibrous, fluffy bolls that contain long, fine fibers, which are prized for their strength and softness. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with woody stems and broad, lobed leaves. It produces flowers that transition into the cotton bolls, which mature through a series of color changes before opening to release the fibers. Due to its unique genetic makeup and environmental adaptations, it is of interest in botanical studies and agricultural research."
