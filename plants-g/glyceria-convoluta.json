    "intro": "Glyceria convoluta, commonly known as narrowleaf glyceria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny flowers. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in temperate regions. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. Glyceria convoluta plays a role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to water filtration and supporting biodiversity."
