    "intro": "Gentiana baltica, commonly known as the Baltic gentian, is a perennial herb native to the cool, moist environments of northern Europe. It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, and it thrives in shaded, woodland areas. Gentiana baltica is known for its medicinal properties, with historical use in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a nectar source for pollinators and its contribution to biodiversity in its native habitats."
