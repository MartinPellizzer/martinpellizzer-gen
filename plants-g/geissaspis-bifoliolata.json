    "intro": "Geissaspis bifoliolata, commonly known as the two-leafed geissaspis, is a rare and unique member of the Acanthaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology, featuring two small, lobed leaves at the base of each stem. The plant produces striking tubular flowers that are typically a vivid shade of red or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
