    "intro": "Galium ankaratrense, commonly known as the Ankaratra bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces tiny white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the wet season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
