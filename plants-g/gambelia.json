    "intro": "Gambelia, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. Gambelia thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun. It plays an important role in desert ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators like bees and hummingbirds."
