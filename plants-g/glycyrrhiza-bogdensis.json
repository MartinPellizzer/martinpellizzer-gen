    "intro": "Glycyrrhiza bogdensis, commonly known as the Siberian licorice, is a perennial herb native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern China. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its stout, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into pods containing several seeds. Glycyrrhiza bogdensis is notable for its high concentration of glycyrrhizin, a compound used in traditional medicine. However, due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
