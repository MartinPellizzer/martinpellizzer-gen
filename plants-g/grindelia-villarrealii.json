It is characterized by its yellowish-green flowers and is often found in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Grindelia villarrealii plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest in ecological and botanical studies."
