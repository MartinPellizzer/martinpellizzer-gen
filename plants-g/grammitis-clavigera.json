It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Grammitis clavigera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
