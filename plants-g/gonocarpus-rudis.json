It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a succulent, fleshy stem and leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in a waxy coating. Its flowers are borne on tall, branching stalks and are adapted to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Gonocarpus rudis is well-suited to saline and coastal environments, making it a hardy and resilient species."
