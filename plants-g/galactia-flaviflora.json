    "intro": "Galactia flaviflora, commonly known as the yellow-flowered galactia, is a leguminous plant native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, legume-like pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in open woodlands and prairies. Galactia flaviflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in nitrogen fixation in the soil."
