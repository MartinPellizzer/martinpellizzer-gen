    "intro": "Gymnogramma glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often covered with small, glandular dots. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Gymnogramma glandulifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
