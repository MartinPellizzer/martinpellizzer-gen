    "intro": "Gahnia javanica, commonly known as the Java sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland or swampy areas, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, often dominating aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. Gahnia javanica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
