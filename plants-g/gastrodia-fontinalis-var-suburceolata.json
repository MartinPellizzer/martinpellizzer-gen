    "intro": "Gastrodia fontinalis var. suburceolata, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a rare and specialized plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a unique reproductive structure known as a strobilus. This variety is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and stream banks. Its growth is slow, and it often forms dense, low-growing mats. Due to its limited habitat and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
