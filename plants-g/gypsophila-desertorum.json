    "intro": "Gypsophila desertorum, commonly known as the desert candytuft, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial with slender stems and clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh, desert environment. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xeriscaping and rock gardens. Gypsophila desertorum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor, sandy soils."
