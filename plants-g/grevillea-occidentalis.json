    "intro": "Grevillea occidentalis, commonly known as the Western Grevillea, is a flowering plant native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a waxy coating, and its stems are covered in fine, soft hairs. Grevillea occidentalis is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient addition to native gardens."
