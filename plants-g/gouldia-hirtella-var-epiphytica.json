    "intro": "Gouldia hirtella var. epiphytica, commonly known as the red-tipped pelargonium, is a compact, flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its vibrant red bracts that surround small, pale yellow flowers, giving it a striking appearance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, meaning it attaches itself to trees or other surfaces without deriving nutrients from them. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive. This variety is popular in gardens for its ornamental value and ease of care."
