    "intro": "Gesneria selloi, commonly known as the Sello's gesneria, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Madagascar. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a slight waxy coating. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Gesneria selloi is popular among collectors for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
