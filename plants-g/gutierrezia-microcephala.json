It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and rocky soils, and is adapted to drought conditions. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces small, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss."
