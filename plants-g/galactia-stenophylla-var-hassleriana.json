    "intro": "Galactia stenophylla var. hassleriana, commonly known as the Hassler's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, round pods containing several seeds, and its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along canyon walls. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it ecologically significant in its native range."
