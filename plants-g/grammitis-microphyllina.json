    "intro": "Grammitis microphyllina, commonly known as the small-leaved lady fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are usually covered in a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures called trichomes. Grammitis microphyllina plays an important ecological role in maintaining the microhabitat of forest floors and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
