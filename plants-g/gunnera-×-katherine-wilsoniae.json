    "intro": "Gunnera \u00d7 katherine-wilsoniae, commonly known as the hybrid giant shield fern, is a striking plant native to the southern Andes. It is a hybrid between Gunnera manicata and Gunnera tetragona, resulting in a large, robust plant with broad, shield-shaped leaves. The plant features a thick, fleshy caudex that stores water, allowing it to thrive in moist, temperate climates. Its foliage can grow up to several feet in diameter, making it a dramatic addition to gardens. It prefers partial to full shade and well-draining soil, and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
