    "intro": "Geophila ingens, commonly known as the giant geophila, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and streamside areas. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Geophila ingens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
