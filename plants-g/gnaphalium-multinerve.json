    "intro": "Gnaphalium multinerve, commonly known as the common cudweed, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green flower heads and finely divided, thread-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and wetlands. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against herbivory. Gnaphalium multinerve is an annual or biennial plant that produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, contributing to its role in ecological systems."
