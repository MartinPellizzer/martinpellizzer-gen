    "intro": "Gentlea vatteri, commonly known as the Vatter's gentian, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its stems are often hairy and branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gentlea vatteri is considered a rare and endangered species."
