It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its distinctive, ribbed stems and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant has a spiny exterior, with areoles that bear both spines and flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to poor soils and limited water availability. Gutzlaffia exareolata is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique appearance and resilience."
