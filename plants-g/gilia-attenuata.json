    "intro": "Gilia attenuata, commonly known as the slender gilia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas, preferring full sun. Its flowers, which range in color from yellow to red, bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Gilia attenuata is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in arid environments with minimal water."
