    "intro": "Gundelia glabra, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant has a short, upright stem with narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of hair, aiding in water retention. Its small yellow flowers bloom in the spring, and the plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Gundelia glabra is also noted for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its potential use in ecological restoration projects."
