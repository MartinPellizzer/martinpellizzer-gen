    "intro": "Gordonia mollis, commonly known as the velvetleaf wax tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in humid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by fleshy, orange-red berries. Its bark contains high levels of tannins, making it valuable in traditional medicine and industry. Gordonia mollis plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
