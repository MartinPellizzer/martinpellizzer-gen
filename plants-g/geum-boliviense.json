    "intro": "Geum boliviense, commonly known as the Bolivian avens, is a perennial herb native to the high Andes of Bolivia and Peru. It features upright, branched stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are palmately divided with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late summer. Its roots are fibrous and have been traditionally used in South American herbal medicine. Geum boliviense thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions."
