    "intro": "Grammitis hyalina, commonly known as the translucent fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The fronds are usually pale green to white in color, with a waxy, translucent appearance that helps reduce water loss in its often humid, shaded habitats. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing on tree trunks or rocks. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
