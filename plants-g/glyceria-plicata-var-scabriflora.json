    "intro": "Glyceria plicata var. scabriflora, commonly known as the roughleaf glyceria, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are rough to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its ecological importance lies in providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
