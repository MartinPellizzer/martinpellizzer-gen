It is a member of the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are usually pink or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it has a sprawling or ascending growth habit. Gilia tenella is often found in disturbed soils and can be an important component of xerophytic plant communities."
