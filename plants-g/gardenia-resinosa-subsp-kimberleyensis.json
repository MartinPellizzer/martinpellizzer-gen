It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a resinous sap, which gives it its scientific name, and is adapted to the arid and semi-arid conditions of its native habitat. It is often found in rocky outcrops and along riverbanks, thriving in well-drained soils. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is also significant in the local ecosystem."
