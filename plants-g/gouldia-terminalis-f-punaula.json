    "intro": "Gouldia terminalis f. punaula, commonly known as the silver-leafed gouldia, is a rare and striking plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its limited natural range, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to preserve its genetic diversity."
