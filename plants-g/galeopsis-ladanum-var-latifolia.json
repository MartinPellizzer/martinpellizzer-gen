    "intro": "Galeopsis ladanum var. latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf hedge nettle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in meadows. It has a hairy stem and produces seeds in small, capsule-like structures. This variety is distinguished from the typical form by its wider leaves and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
