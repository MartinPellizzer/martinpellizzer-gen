    "intro": "Glossostelma brevilobum, commonly known as the small-lobed starwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Gesneriaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with five lobes. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Glossostelma brevilobum is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
