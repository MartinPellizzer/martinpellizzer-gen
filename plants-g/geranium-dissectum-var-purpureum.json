    "intro": "Geranium dissectum var. purpureum, commonly known as the Purpleleaf Geranium, is a striking perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are finely dissected, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant produces showy clusters of five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
