    "intro": "Geboscon, commonly known as the silverleaf geranium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and clusters of small, pink or red flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Geboscon is also valued for its ability to attract beneficial insects like bees and butterflies."
