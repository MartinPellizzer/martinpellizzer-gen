    "intro": "Galium erectum var. diffusum, commonly known as silverweed or creeping bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine, silky hairs that give it a silvery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
