    "intro": "Galium aegeum f. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent wood-sorrel, is a variant of the wood-sorrel species native to parts of Europe. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its stems are often hairy, giving it the 'pubescens' designation, which refers to the presence of fine pubescence. The flowers bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch of yellow to the undergrowth."
