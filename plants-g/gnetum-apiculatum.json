    "intro": "Gnetum apiculatum, commonly known as the tropical climbing gymnosperm, is a unique plant belonging to the Gnetophyta division. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, simple leaves that are often leathery in texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers, which are typically unisexual and arranged in clusters. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, three-lobed structure, a feature that distinguishes it from other gymnosperms. Gnetum apiculatum thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in lowland rainforests."
