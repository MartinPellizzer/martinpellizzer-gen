    "intro": "Geniostoma micranthum var. paganense, commonly known as the Pagan endemic gentian, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gentianaceae, characterized by its showy, often blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it thrives in humid and cool environments. Its small, clustered flowers are adapted for pollination by insects, particularly bees and flies. Due to habitat loss, this variant is considered rare and is of interest in botanical conservation efforts."
