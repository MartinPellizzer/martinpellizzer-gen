    "intro": "Geonoma atrovirens, commonly known as the black-veined fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds with prominent, contrasting veins. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, fibrous layer that aids in water retention. The fronds are usually pinnately compound, with a distinctive, narrow shape that contributes to its ornamental appeal."
