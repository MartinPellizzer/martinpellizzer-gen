    "intro": "Gymnopteris quercifolia, commonly known as the oak-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, lobed fronds that resemble the shape of an oak leaf, giving it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense mats. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in humid environments. Gymnopteris quercifolia thrives in shaded, moist woodland areas and is often found growing on rocks or in the undergrowth of forests."
