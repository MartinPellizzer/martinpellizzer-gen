    "intro": "Gaultheria ngii, commonly known as the Ngii wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by bright red berries that are edible but have a strong, spicy flavor. Gaultheria ngii thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its leaves contain compounds that give it a distinctive mint-like aroma, making it a subject of interest in both botanical research and traditional medicine."
