    "intro": "Geranium aedonianum, commonly known as the narrowleaf geranium, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features upright stems covered in opposite, ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink or purple, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and attractive foliage."
