    "intro": "Gleichenia furcata var. tomentosa, commonly known as the tomentose Gleichenia, is a fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is characterized by its creeping rhizome and dense, hairy fronds that are often covered with a fine, white pubescence. The fronds are typically divided into segments with a distinct, linear shape and are arranged in a compact, mat-like growth pattern. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important component of temperate and subtropical ecosystems."
