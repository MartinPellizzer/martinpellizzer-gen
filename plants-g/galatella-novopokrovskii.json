    "intro": "Galatella novopokrovskii, commonly known as the Novopokrovskii's galatella, is a rare and unique plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family, and blooms during the summer months. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
