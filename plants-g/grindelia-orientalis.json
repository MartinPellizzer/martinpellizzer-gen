    "intro": "Grindelia orientalis, commonly known as the desert groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Grindelia orientalis is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators. Its resilience to drought and heat makes it an important component of its ecosystem."
