    "intro": "Grubbia rosmarinifolia subsp. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy gravel root, is a member of the Apiaceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its aromatic, finely divided leaves that resemble those of parsley. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences, particularly in the density of its hairy covering."
