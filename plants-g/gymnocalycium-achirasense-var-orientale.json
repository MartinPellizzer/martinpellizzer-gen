    "intro": "Gymnocalycium achirasense var. orientale, commonly known as the Oriental Moon Cactus, is a cacti species native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its short, thick stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green or blue-green stems. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and unique appearance. The varietal form 'orientale' is distinguished by its specific coloration and growth patterns compared to the typical form of the species."
