    "intro": "Gomphocarpus albens, commonly known as the silverleaf milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Gomphocarpus albens is often found in sandy or rocky soils in grassland habitats."
