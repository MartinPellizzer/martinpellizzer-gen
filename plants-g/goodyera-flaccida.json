    "intro": "Goodyera flaccida, commonly known as the slender lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a dense, loose inflorescence of small, white to pale green flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form colonies, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Goodyera flaccida is a relatively rare and endangered species, requiring specific ecological conditions for successful propagation."
