    "intro": "Goeppertia maasiorum, commonly known as the Zebra plant, is a striking tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its broad, dark green leaves with distinctive white or silver markings that resemble a zebra's pattern. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 feet. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Goeppertia maasiorum is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
