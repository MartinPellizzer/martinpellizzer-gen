    "intro": "Gymnostoma leucodon, commonly known as the white-veined fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine, white veins. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Gymnostoma leucodon is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
