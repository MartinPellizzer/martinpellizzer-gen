    "intro": "Gilia, commonly known as the \"flower of the desert,\" is a diverse genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Malvaceae. These plants are typically herbaceous, with slender stems and showy, often brightly colored flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Gilia species are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas, where they have adapted to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Their flowers often have five petals and are arranged in clusters, with some species producing both showy and less conspicuous blooms. Gilia plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
