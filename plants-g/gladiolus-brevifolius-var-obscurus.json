    "intro": "Gladiolus brevifolius var. obscurus, commonly known as the dark-leaved gladiolus, is a rare and striking member of the Iridaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and often covered in a waxy coating. The flowers are typically pale to dark purple, with intricate patterns and a prominent, spurred tepal. This variety is native to southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is highly valued by botanists and horticulturists alike."
