    "intro": "Geonoma fosteri, commonly known as the Foster's fern, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding structure, typical of many bromeliads. Its flowers are small and clustered, often emerging from the leaf axils. Geonoma fosteri is often found growing on tree trunks or in shaded forest understories, where it thrives in humid, warm environments."
