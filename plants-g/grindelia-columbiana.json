    "intro": "Grindelia columbiana, commonly known as the Columbia brittlebush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and yellow-orange flower clusters that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its leaves are covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss, an adaptation to its arid environment. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
