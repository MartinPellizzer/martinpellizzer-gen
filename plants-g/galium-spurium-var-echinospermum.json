    "intro": "Galium spurium var. echinospermum, commonly known as the spiny-fruited bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, branched stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its distinctive characteristic is the spiny, spherical fruits that develop from the flowers, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides."
