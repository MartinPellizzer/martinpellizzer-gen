It is characterized by its elongated peduncles, which bear clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces small, round, dark blue berries. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
