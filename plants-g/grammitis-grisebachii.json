It typically grows on tree trunks or branches, forming dense, compact colonies. The plant has narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in a silvery or grayish coating, giving it its common name. Its fronds are usually dark green with a leathery texture and are arranged in a spiral pattern. Grammitis grisebachii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
