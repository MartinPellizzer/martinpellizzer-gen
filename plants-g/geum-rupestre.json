    "intro": "Geum rupestre, commonly known as rock beauty, is a perennial flowering plant native to North America. It thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in dry, sunny habitats such as prairies and rocky outcrops. The plant produces showy, bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Geum rupestre is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
