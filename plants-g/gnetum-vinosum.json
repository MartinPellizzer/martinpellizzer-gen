    "intro": "Gnetum vinosum, commonly known as the red gnetum, is a member of the Gnetophyta division, characterized by its unique combination of gymnosperm and angiosperm traits. It is a dioecious plant, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant produces small, scale-like leaves and has a woody stem with a distinctive reddish coloration. Its flowers are unisexual, with male flowers clustered in catkins and female flowers solitary. Gnetum vinosum is also notable for its ability to produce a sticky, resinous substance that can be used in traditional medicine."
