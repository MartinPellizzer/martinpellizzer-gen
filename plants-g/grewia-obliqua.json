    "intro": "Grewia obliqua, commonly known as the red gum tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers followed by bright red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and rocky areas. Grewia obliqua is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
