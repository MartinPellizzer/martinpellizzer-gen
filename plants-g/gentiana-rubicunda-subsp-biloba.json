    "intro": "Gentiana rubicunda subsp. biloba, commonly known as the red gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The subspecies biloba is distinguished by its bifurcated (two-lobed) petals, a feature that sets it apart from other gentian species."
