    "intro": "Globulea erosula var. inamoena, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative means make it an invasive species in some areas."
