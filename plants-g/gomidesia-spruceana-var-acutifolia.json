    "intro": "Gomidesia spruceana var. acutifolia, commonly known as the acute-leaved gomidesia, is a rare and specialized plant native to specific high-altitude regions. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are sharply pointed, adapted to minimize water loss in its harsh environment. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine substrates, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often clustered in tight inflorescences, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
