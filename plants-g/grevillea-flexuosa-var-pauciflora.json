It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically gray-green in color and arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, bright red flowers clustered in dense, cylindrical spikes, which bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its distinctive foliage and seasonal flowering display."
