    "intro": "Goniopteris glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular fern, is a tropical fern species characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds. The leaves are typically light green with a textured surface and are often covered in small, glandular dots, which give the plant its scientific name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant's reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it produces spores rather than seeds. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in botanical studies."
