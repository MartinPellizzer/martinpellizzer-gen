    "intro": "Gongylolepis paniculata, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and large, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found on the trunks of trees in humid forests. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
