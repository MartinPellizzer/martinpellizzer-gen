    "intro": "Galium spurium subsp. infestum, commonly known as creeping bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and often have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
