    "intro": "Gastoniella chaerophylla, commonly known as the rock hibiscus, is a small perennial herb native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. It is characterized by its succulent stems, which help it retain water in dry conditions. Gastoniella chaerophylla is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental appearance."
