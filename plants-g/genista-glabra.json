    "intro": "Genista glabra, commonly known as the bristly broom, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its stems are typically covered in fine, bristly hairs, which give it its common name. Genista glabra is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open woodlands."
