    "intro": "Glycine angulosa, commonly known as the angular bean or angular sickle bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, typically arranged in a zigzag pattern along the stem. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated, angular pods containing several seeds. Glycine angulosa is adapted to grow in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Its seeds are used in traditional medicine and as a food source in some regions."
