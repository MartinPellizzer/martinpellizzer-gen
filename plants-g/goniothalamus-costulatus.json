    "intro": "Goniothalamus costulatus, commonly known as the narrow-ribbed goniothalamus, is a member of the Annonaceae family. It is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in the tropical rainforests of Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its slender trunk and compound leaves with a smooth, glossy surface. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically greenish-white in color, and it produces berries that are edible for some bird species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
