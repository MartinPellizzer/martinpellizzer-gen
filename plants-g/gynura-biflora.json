    "intro": "Gynura biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered gynura, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features palmately lobed leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive appearance. Its small yellow flowers are arranged in dense clusters, contributing to its ornamental value. Gynura biflora is often cultivated for its foliage rather than its flowers, due to its unique leaf structure."
