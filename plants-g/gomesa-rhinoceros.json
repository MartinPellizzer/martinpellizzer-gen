    "intro": "Gomesa rhinoceros, commonly known as the horned gomesa, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Arecaceae family, which includes palms, and is characterized by its robust, trunk-like stem and large, fan-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, round fruits that contain a single seed. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs. However, it faces threats from habitat loss and overharvesting in the wild."
