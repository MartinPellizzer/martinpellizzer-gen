    "intro": "Gossypium latifolium f. flavum, commonly known as the yellow-leaf cottonweed, is a variant of the cotton plant characterized by its broad, yellowish-green leaves. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is native to parts of Mexico and Central America. The plant produces small, woolly flowers that typically bloom in the summer months. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This cultivar is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique coloration and potential for hybridization."
