    "intro": "Gnaphalium orbiculare, commonly known as the globe willow or cushion plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing mat of rounded, fleshy leaves that form a compact cushion. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is adapted to cold, dry environments. Its succulent leaves help it retain moisture in harsh conditions."
