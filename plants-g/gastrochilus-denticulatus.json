    "intro": "Gastrochilus denticulatus, commonly known as the toothed lip orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with intricate, tooth-like markings on the lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they attach to tree trunks without parasitizing them. Gastrochilus denticulatus is valued for its ornamental beauty and is occasionally cultivated for horticultural purposes."
