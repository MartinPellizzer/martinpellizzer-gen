    "intro": "Grammitis solida, commonly known as the hard-leaf fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The fronds are typically short and upright, with a distinctive, solid appearance that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Grammitis solida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings."
