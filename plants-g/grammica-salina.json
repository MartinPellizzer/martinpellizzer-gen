    "intro": "Grammica salina, commonly known as the saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and coastal regions. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it well adapted to saline and drought conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Grammica salina plays an important role in stabilizing soils in coastal and saline environments."
