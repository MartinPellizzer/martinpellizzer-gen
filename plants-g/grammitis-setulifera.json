    "intro": "Grammitis setulifera, commonly known as the hairy grammitis, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of root hairs, which aid in water absorption. Grammitis setulifera is a popular epiphytic plant in horticulture due to its ornamental appearance and ease of care."
