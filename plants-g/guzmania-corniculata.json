    "intro": "Guzmania corniculata, commonly known as the flame plant, is a striking tropical bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves. The plant features a rosette-shaped structure with a central cup that collects water, supporting its epiphytic growth habit. Its foliage is typically broad and sword-like, with a waxy texture. Guzmania corniculata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate humidity to flourish."
