    "intro": "Gleichenia circinnata var. alpina, commonly known as the Alpine Gleichenia, is a fern species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and alpine meadows. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered in small, rounded clusters called sori. This variety is notable for its adaptability to cold climates and its role in stabilizing soil in rocky, high-altitude habitats."
