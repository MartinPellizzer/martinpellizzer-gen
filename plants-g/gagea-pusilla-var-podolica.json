    "intro": "Gagea pusilla var. podolica, commonly known as the Podolic spring beauty, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Eastern Europe. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and rocky soils, preferring cool and humid environments. The plant features delicate, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring. Its bulbs are adapted for storage of nutrients, allowing it to survive harsh winter conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
