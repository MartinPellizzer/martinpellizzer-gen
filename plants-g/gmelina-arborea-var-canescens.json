    "intro": "Gmelina arborea var. canescens, commonly known as the hairy gmelina, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, often greyish bark and lanceolate leaves that are typically covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by elongated, woody fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist lowland areas and secondary forests. Due to its rapid growth and hardy nature, it is sometimes used in reforestation and as a source of timber and medicinal compounds."
