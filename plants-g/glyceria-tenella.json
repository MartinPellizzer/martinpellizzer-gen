    "intro": "Glyceria tenella, commonly known as slender glyceria, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, pond margins, and along streams. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in dense clusters, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers. Glyceria tenella plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
