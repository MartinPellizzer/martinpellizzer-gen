    "intro": "Guerkea uropetala, commonly known as the Mexican ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southern Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its thick, dark green leaves that are often clustered at the ends of the branches. The tree produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland evergreen forests. Due to its hard, heavy wood, it has been historically used for construction and tool-making."
