    "intro": "Gaultheria pumila, commonly known as the dwarf waxleaf, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of the southern United States. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in the spring, followed by red or orange berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its dense growth habit and seasonal color changes."
