It features small, yellow flowers with five petals and hairy, alternate leaves that are usually heart-shaped. The plant produces numerous tiny seeds enclosed in a spiny, spherical capsule. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and invasive tendencies make it a common weed in many regions."
