    "intro": "Gleditsia triacanthos f. pendula, commonly known as the weeping honeylocust, is a deciduous tree native to the central and eastern United States. It is a cultivar of the honeylocust species, characterized by its distinctive cascading branches that create a dramatic, umbrella-like appearance. The tree produces small, green, pod-like fruits that mature to a brown color, and its compound leaves are typically bipinnately divided. It is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and tolerance to urban conditions. The weeping honeylocust is also valued for its ability to thrive in full sun and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
