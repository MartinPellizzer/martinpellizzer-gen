    "intro": "Glycine malacophylla, commonly known as the velvetleaf soybean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in a soft, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Glycine malacophylla is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. This trait makes it an important plant in agricultural systems where soil fertility is a concern."
