    "intro": "Gaultheria loheri, commonly known as the Andean wintergreen, is a species of shrub native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible berries that are rich in aromatic compounds. Gaultheria loheri is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly for its ability to produce compounds with analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects. Its ability to thrive in cool, moist environments makes it an important component of montane ecosystems."
