    "intro": "Grewia guazumifolia, commonly known as the African snowball, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white, five-petaled flowers that resemble snowballs, which bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape and often have a slightly hairy texture. It produces small, round, red or orange fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Grewia guazumifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in dry, sunny conditions."
