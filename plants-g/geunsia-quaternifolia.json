    "intro": "Geunsia quaternifolia, commonly known as the four-leaf clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its rarity and symbolic significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for ornamental purposes."
