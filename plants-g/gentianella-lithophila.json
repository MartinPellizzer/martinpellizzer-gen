    "intro": "Gentianella lithophila, commonly known as the rock gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It thrives in rocky and limestone habitats, often growing on cliffs or in crevices. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, adapted to conserve moisture in its arid environment. Gentianella lithophila is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native ecosystems."
