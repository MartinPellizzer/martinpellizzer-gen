    "intro": "Gagea pratensis subsp. nova, commonly known as the alpine gagea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, arranged in a loose inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
