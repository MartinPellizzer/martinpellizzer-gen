    "intro": "Gilia polyantha, commonly known as the showy gilia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands, often in areas with well-drained soil. It produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across various regions. Gilia polyantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
