    "intro": "Gastrodia queenslandica, commonly known as the Queensland ginseng, is a rare and unusual orchid native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungi for its nutrition. The plant produces a single, fleshy, yellowish-brown tuber that contains the majority of its biomass. It flowers in late summer or early autumn, producing small, pale green to white flowers that are often overlooked due to their inconspicuous appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species and is protected in its native range."
