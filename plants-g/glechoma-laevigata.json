    "intro": "Glechoma laevigata, commonly known as smooth ground-ivy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It features heart-shaped leaves with a smooth texture and a distinctive purple-tinged underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous blue or violet flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Glechoma laevigata is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through stolons, making it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed."
