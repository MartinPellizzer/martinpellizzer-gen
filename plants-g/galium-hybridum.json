    "intro": "Galium hybridum, commonly known as bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Galium hybridum is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
