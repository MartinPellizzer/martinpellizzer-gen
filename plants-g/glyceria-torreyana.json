    "intro": "Glyceria torreyana, commonly known as Torrey's glyceria, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and stream banks, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes are often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Glyceria torreyana plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, including insects and waterfowl."
