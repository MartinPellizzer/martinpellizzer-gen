    "intro": "Gleichenia caudata, commonly known as the long-tailed maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often tinged with rust-colored markings. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori, which are protected by indusia, a feature common in many ferns. Gleichenia caudata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its elegant appearance."
