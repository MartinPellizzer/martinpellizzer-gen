    "intro": "Galium modestum, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to North America. It features slender, sprawling stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Galium modestum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks."
