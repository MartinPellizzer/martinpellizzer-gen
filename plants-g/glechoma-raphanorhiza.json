    "intro": "Glechoma raphanorhiza, commonly known as field woundwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a hairy surface and small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a creeping rhizomatous root system, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its medicinal properties have been historically used for wound healing and as a remedy for respiratory ailments."
