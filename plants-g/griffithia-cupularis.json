    "intro": "Griffithia cupularis, commonly known as the cupular griffithia, is a rare and ancient plant species native to South America. It belongs to the family Gnetaceae, which includes gymnosperms, and is characterized by its unique morphology and evolutionary significance. The plant typically grows as a small shrub with compound leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in a cup-like structure, giving it its common name. Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, Griffithia cupularis is considered a valuable subject for botanical research."
