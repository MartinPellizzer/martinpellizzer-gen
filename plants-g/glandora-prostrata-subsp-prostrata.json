    "intro": "Glandora prostrata subsp. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate glandora, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to parts of southern Africa. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs, which contribute to its name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its compact growth habit, it is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry landscapes."
