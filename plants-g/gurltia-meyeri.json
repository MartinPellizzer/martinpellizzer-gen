    "intro": "Gurltia meyeri, commonly known as the Meyer's gurltia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue petals and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its blooming period occurs during the spring and early summer months. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
