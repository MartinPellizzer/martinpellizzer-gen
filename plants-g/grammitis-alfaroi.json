It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that form a compact rosette. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Grammitis alfaroi is notable for its unique reproductive structures, which include sporangia that are clustered in specialized leaf arrangements. This species is of interest to botanists due to its ecological role and potential medicinal properties."
