    "intro": "Grammica basarabica, commonly known as the Basarabica Grammica, is a rare flowering plant native to the Carpathian Mountains in Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a slight sheen, and its flowers are usually pale green or white. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Grammica basarabica is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
