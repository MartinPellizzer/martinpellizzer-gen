    "intro": "Gothofreda proboscidea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, slender roots and produces delicate, white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its unique morphology and habitat requirements make it highly specialized and vulnerable to environmental changes. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this rare species from habitat loss and climate change."
