    "intro": "Gomphocarpus rigidus, commonly known as the rigid milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers clustered in umbels, which attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Gomphocarpus rigidus is typically found in grasslands and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils."
