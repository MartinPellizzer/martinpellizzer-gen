    "intro": "Guapira harrisiana, commonly known as the Harris's guapira, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and has glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. These flowers are followed by small, round fruits that turn red when mature. Guapira harrisiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden environments."
