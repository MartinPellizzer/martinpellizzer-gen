    "intro": "Geranium mollendinense, commonly known as the Canary Island geranium, is a perennial herb native to the Canary Islands. It features upright stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, and its leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Geranium mollendinense thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long flowering period."
