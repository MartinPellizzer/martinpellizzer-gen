    "intro": "Gomphandra quadrifida var. triplinervis, commonly known as the three-veined gomphandra, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring a triplinervous venation pattern that distinguishes it from other members of the family. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it relies on high humidity and nutrient-rich soil. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing nectar that attracts specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this variant is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
