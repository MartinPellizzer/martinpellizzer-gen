    "intro": "Galactia martioides, commonly known as the Mexican milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, clustered flowers that range from white to pink. The plant produces pods that contain seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal. It is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions. Galactia martioides also has a milky sap that can be toxic, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
