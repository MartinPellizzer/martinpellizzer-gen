    "intro": "Gaylussacia lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf clethra, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands and wetlands. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement and have a smooth, dark green upper surface. It produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The berries that follow are dark blue to black and are an important food source for birds and small mammals."
