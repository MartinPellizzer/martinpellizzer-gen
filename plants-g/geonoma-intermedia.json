    "intro": "Geonoma intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate geonoma, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of its leaves, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the wild."
