    "intro": "Galium verum var. typicum, commonly known as golden bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces tiny, bead-like fruits called drupes, which contain a single seed. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
