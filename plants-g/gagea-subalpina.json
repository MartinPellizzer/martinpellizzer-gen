    "intro": "Gagea subalpina, commonly known as the alpine gagea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in alpine meadows and forested areas. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and bears small, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers in early spring. Its bulbs are adapted to survive harsh winter conditions and are often covered in a protective layer of soil. Gagea subalpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its alpine habitat."
