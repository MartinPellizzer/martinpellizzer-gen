    "intro": "Glycine montana, commonly known as the mountain soybean, is a climbing legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features compound leaves with trifoliate arrangements and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is characterized by its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. Glycine montana thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Its seeds are edible and have been used traditionally in some Asian cuisines."
