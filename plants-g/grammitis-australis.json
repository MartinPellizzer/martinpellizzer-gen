    "intro": "Grammitis australis, commonly known as the Australian chain fern, is a species of fern native to Australia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, chain-like fronds that are typically less than 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rainforests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce adventitious roots, allowing it to anchor itself in soil and absorb nutrients. The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
