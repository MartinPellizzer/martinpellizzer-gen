    "intro": "Glottiphyllum proclive, commonly known as the creeping glottiphyllum, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, characterized by its fleshy leaves and adaptive structures for arid environments. The plant typically grows in a prostrate or creeping habit, forming dense mats that help retain moisture. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, often adorned with small, white or pale-colored teeth along the edges. The flowers, when present, are small and typically yellow or orange, contributing to its ornamental appeal in dry gardens."
