    "intro": "Galium maritimum, commonly known as sea spurge, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is a low-growing herbaceous plant with opposite, lance-shaped leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in dunes and coastal scrub habitats. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Galium maritimum is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate harsh maritime conditions."
