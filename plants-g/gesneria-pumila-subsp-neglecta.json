    "intro": "Gesneria pumila subsp. neglecta, commonly known as the dwarf gesneria, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It features broad, glossy, dark green leaves that are often slightly curled at the edges. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically blooming in the spring or early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
