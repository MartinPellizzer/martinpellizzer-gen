    "intro": "Gesneria bulbosa var. suttonii, commonly known as the Sutton's gesneria, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features broad, waxy, dark green leaves with a slightly textured surface and a distinctive reddish or purplish hue on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and adaptability to indoor growing conditions."
