    "intro": "Gentianella macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Gentianella macrophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
