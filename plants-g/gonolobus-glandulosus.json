    "intro": "Gonolobus glandulosus, commonly known as the stickyleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its glandular leaves, which secrete a sticky substance, and its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that typically bloom in the morning. The plant belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as roadside banks and forest edges. Its seeds are dispersed by animals that feed on the fleshy, berry-like fruits. The species is also noted for its rapid growth and ability to climb or trail along surfaces."
