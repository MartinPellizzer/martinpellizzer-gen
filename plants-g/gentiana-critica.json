    "intro": "Gentiana critica, commonly known as the critical gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. It blooms during the summer months, producing showy inflorescences that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gentiana critica is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
