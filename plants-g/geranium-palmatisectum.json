    "intro": "Geranium palmatisectum, commonly known as the broad-leaved geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which give it a distinctive, almost palm-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to red flowers during the summer months. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive, textured leaves. Geranium palmatisectum thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
