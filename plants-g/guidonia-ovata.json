    "intro": "Guidonia ovata, commonly known as the oval-leaved guidonia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, ovate leaves that are often hairy and arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly seen in its natural environment."
