    "intro": "Glicophyllum, commonly known as the golden cup fungus, is a type of edible mushroom belonging to the family Cantharellaceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow to orange color and its cup-shaped or bell-shaped cap, which often has a smooth or slightly wrinkled surface. The gills are typically absent, and the stem is short and sturdy. This fungus is often found in forested areas, growing on decaying wood, particularly in association with coniferous trees. It is prized for its mild, slightly sweet flavor and is a popular choice among foragers and gourmet chefs."
