    "intro": "Garcinia mangostana var. malaccensis, commonly known as the Malacca mangosteen, is a variant of the mangosteen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are elliptical and glossy, and its fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The fruit is typically smaller than the standard mangosteen, with a thick, purple rind and segmented white flesh. The plant thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and the edible, tart fruit it produces."
