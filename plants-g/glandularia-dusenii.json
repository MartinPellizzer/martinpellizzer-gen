    "intro": "Glandularia dusenii, commonly known as the Dusen's glandularia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. Its glandular structures on the leaves are thought to play a role in water conservation and chemical defense. Glandularia dusenii is a member of the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance."
