    "intro": "Galium ciliare subsp. ciliare, commonly known as the silky bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and have ciliate (fringed) margins. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
