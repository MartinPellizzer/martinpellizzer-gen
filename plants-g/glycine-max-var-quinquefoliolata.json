    "intro": "Glycine max var. quinquefoliolata, commonly known as the five-leaf soybean, is a botanical variant of the soybean plant characterized by its distinctive foliage. This variety exhibits a unique leaf morphology with five leaflets per compound leaf, setting it apart from the typical three-leaf structure of standard soybeans. It is native to eastern Asia and is primarily cultivated for its high protein content and adaptability to various soil conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into pods containing edible seeds used in food and industrial applications. Its genetic traits make it a subject of interest in agricultural research for improving soybean resilience and yield."
