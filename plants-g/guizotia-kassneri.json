    "intro": "Guizotia kassneri, commonly known as the Kassner's guizotia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within its native range."
