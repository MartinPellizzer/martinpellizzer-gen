    "intro": "Grewia blumei, commonly known as the red sandalwood tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible. Grewia blumei thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for ornamental gardening. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant foliage and attractive fruits, which make it a popular choice in horticulture."
