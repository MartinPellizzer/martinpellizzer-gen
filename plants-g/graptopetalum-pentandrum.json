It features a rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers."
