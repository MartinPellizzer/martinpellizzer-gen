    "intro": "Gerardia portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican gerardia, is a flowering plant native to the island of Puerto Rico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest habitats, often in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a velvety texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in heads. Gerardia portoricensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
