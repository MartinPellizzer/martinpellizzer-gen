    "intro": "Gossypium pallidum, commonly known as the pale cotton plant, is a species of flowering plant in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with warm, humid climates. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fibrous seeds are encased in a fluffy, white cotton-like material, which is used for textile production. Gossypium pallidum is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient environments."
