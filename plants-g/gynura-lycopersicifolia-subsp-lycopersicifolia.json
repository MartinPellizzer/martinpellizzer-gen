    "intro": "Gynura lycopersicifolia subsp. lycopersicifolia, commonly known as the tomato-leaf gynura, is a species of flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, particularly in countries like India and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that resemble those of the tomato plant, hence its common name. It produces small yellow flowers that are clustered in heads, typical of the daisy family. This subshrub is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates."
