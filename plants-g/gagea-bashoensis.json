It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in rocky or well-drained soils, and it thrives in cool, temperate climates.
