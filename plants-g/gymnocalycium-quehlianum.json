    "intro": "Gymnocalycium quehlianum, commonly known as the Quehlian prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its rounded, spiny stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers during the growing season. Its fruit, a type of berry, is edible and often consumed by both humans and animals. Gymnocalycium quehlianum is well adapted to desert conditions, with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss."
