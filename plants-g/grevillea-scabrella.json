    "intro": "Grevillea scabrella, commonly known as the rough-leaved grevillea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, rough-textured leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright red or orange flowers that are clustered in spikes, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Grevillea scabrella is also valued for its hardiness and ability to withstand dry conditions."
