    "intro": "Guettardella solomonense, commonly known as the Solomon Islands staghorn fern, is a unique epiphytic plant native to the Solomon Islands. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that resemble the antlers of a stag. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its rhizomes while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
