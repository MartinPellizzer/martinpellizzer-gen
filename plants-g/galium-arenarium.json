    "intro": "Galium arenarium, commonly known as sand bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and sandy environments. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces tiny white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its adaptations include a deep root system and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss. Galium arenarium plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
