    "intro": "Galactia nitida, commonly known as the silky mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pinnately compound leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by legume pods containing flattened, kidney-shaped seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to thrive in poor soils. Galactia nitida plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
