    "intro": "Gagea sylvatica var. vistulensis, commonly known as the Vistula spring beauty, is a bulbous perennial plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is adapted to temperate climates. Its bulbs store nutrients, allowing it to survive dormant periods and bloom in early spring. The species is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance in its native habitats."
