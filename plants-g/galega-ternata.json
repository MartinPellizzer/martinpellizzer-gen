    "intro": "Galega ternata, commonly known as the three-leafed goat's rue, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, which is a distinguishing feature. Galega ternata is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments."
