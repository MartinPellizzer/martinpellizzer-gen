    "intro": "Galanthus olgae, commonly known as the Olgas' daffodil, is a rare and ornamental plant belonging to the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus, specifically in Georgia and Turkey. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white flowers with a yellow center, resembling daffodils. It thrives in well-drained, slightly acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Galanthus olgae is considered a rare and endangered species."
