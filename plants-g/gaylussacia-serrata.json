    "intro": "Gaylussacia serrata, commonly known as the wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a whitish, waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are an important food source for various bird species. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
