It features opposite, simple, and usually elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers clustered in terminal panicles, which bloom throughout the year in some regions. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Guettarda frangulifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun."
