    "intro": "Gleichenia affinis var. bogotensis, commonly known as the Bogot\u00e1 Gleichenia, is a fern species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its long, strap-like fronds that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests and mountainous areas. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in humid, tropical gardens."
