    "intro": "Gastrodia sesamoides, commonly known as the Chinese thunder god vine, is a rare and unique orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and lack of true leaves, relying instead on its underground tubers for photosynthesis. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. It is often found growing in shaded, humid environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Due to its medicinal properties and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable and endangered plant in traditional herbal medicine."
