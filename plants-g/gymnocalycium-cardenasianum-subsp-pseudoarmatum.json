It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in spines and a compact growth habit. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a sought-after species among cactus enthusiasts and botanists."
