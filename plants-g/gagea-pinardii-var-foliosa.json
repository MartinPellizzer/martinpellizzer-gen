    "intro": "Gagea pinardii var. foliosa, commonly known as the broad-leaved gagea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Liliaceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, broad leaves. The plant produces a single, upright flowering stem bearing a small, bell-shaped flower with six petals. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
