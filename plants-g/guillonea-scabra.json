    "intro": "Guillonea scabra, commonly known as the rough seagrass, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It thrives in shallow, sandy or muddy substrates in marine environments, often forming dense underwater meadows. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are covered in small, rough bumps, giving it its scientific name. It plays an important role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for various marine organisms. Guillonea scabra is also used in traditional medicine by local communities for its purported healing properties."
