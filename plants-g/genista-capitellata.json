    "intro": "Genista capitellata, commonly known as the creeping yellow broom, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, needle-like leaves and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its invasive potential in some areas, it is often considered a weed in non-native habitats."
