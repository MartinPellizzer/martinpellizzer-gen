    "intro": "Geonoma pinnatifrons subsp. pinnatifrons, commonly known as the pinnate-veined geonoma, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds with a pinnate venation pattern. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as rainforests and understorey habitats. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, moss-like layer, which helps in moisture retention. The fronds are usually elongated and arching, contributing to its ornamental appeal in horticultural settings."
