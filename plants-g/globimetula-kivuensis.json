    "intro": "Globimetula kivuensis, commonly known as the Kivu globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, globular inflorescences that resemble small globes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats and has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and bloom during the wet season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
