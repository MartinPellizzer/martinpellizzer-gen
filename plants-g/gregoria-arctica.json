    "intro": "Gregoria arctica, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in harsh, cold environments, often found in tundra and alpine habitats. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss in cold, dry conditions. Gregoria arctica plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for herbivores."
