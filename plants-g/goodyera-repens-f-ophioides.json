    "intro": "Goodyera repens f. ophioides, commonly known as the creeping broad-leafed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing, rhizomatous habit and dense clusters of dark green, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers with three sepals and three petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rock crevices, often forming carpets of foliage. This variant is distinguished by its elongated, vine-like growth form compared to the typical species."
