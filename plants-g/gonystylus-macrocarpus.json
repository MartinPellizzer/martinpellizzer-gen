    "intro": "Gonystylus macrocarpus, commonly known as the sandalwood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, heartwood that is highly valued for its fragrance and durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a smooth texture. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by dark, woody fruits containing single seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
