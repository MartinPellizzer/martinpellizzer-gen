    "intro": "Gentiana kauffmanniana, commonly known as the alpine gentian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its stem is unbranched and bears the flowers at the apex. Gentiana kauffmanniana is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and partial shade."
