    "intro": "Galeola hydra, commonly known as the water fern, is a member of the fern family and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. Its spore-producing structures, called soruses, are located on the underside of its fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Galeola hydra is often used in ornamental gardening due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to tolerate varying water conditions."
