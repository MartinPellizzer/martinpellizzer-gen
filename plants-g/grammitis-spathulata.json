    "intro": "Grammitis spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leaf mossy fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant features lanceolate to ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of moss-like structures. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically found on the undersides of the leaves. Grammitis spathulata plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and moisture retention in its habitat."
