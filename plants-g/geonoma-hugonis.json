    "intro": "Geonoma hugonis, commonly known as the Hugoni\u2019s bryophyte, is a species of moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and leaf-like structures that are typically narrow and elongated. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks at the tips of the stems. Geonoma hugonis plays a vital role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its native habitats."
