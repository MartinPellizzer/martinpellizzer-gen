    "intro": "Gyptis tanacetifolia, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features showy, blue-violet flower clusters that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic when crushed, giving it a distinctive scent. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Its botanical name reflects its resemblance to tanacetum species, such as tansy, due to its similar appearance and fragrance."
