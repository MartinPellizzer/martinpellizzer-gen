It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming from summer to fall. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. Geranium longifolium is often found in open woodlands and rocky slopes, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
