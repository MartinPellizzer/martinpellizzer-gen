It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rainforests or under dense vegetation. Its flowers are borne on tall, slender stems and are often visited by bees and other pollinators.
