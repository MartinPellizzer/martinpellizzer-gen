    "intro": "Glossopetalon meionandrum, commonly known as the small-flowered sandmat, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid regions of Australia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its roots are deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. Glossopetalon meionandrum is well adapted to harsh, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland dunes."
