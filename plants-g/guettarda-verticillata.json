    "intro": "Guettarda verticillata, commonly known as the evergreen shrub or coastal guettarda, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant thrives in coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils, making it a hardy choice for seaside gardens. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often have a glossy appearance, while its roots form a fibrous network that helps stabilize sandy shorelines. Guettarda verticillata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in coastal ecosystems."
