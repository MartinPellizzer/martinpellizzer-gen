    "intro": "Geum rossii var. depressum, commonly known as the alpine avens, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of North America. It features basal leaves that are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, with a compact growth habit that helps it survive in harsh alpine conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Due to its delicate appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
