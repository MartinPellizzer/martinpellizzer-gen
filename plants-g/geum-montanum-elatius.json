It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous habitats. It has a short growing season and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds. Geum montanum elatius plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
