    "intro": "Gordonia pubescens var. subglabra, commonly known as the smooth gordonia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves that are typically pubescent on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by elongated, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and wetland restoration projects."
