    "intro": "Gnaphalium cheiranthifolium var. psilophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cudweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its small, daisy-like yellow flowers and narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. It is a perennial herb that produces fluffy, white seeds for wind dispersal. Due to its delicate structure and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
