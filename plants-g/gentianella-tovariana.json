    "intro": "Gentianella tovariana, commonly known as the Tovar's gentian, is a perennial herb native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as cloud forests and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, and it has a short, stout stem. Gentianella tovariana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant color and ecological benefits."
