    "intro": "Galium ascendens, commonly known as climbing wood sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, twining stems that climb by means of adventitious roots. The plant features opposite, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive veining pattern, and small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Galium ascendens is often found in areas with rich, loamy soil and partial to full shade."
