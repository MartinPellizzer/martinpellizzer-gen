    "intro": "Garrya pallida, commonly known as the whiteleaf holly, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are pale green and often covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Garrya pallida is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
