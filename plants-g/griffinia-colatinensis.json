    "intro": "Griffinia colatinensis, commonly known as the Brazilian starling fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the Atlantic rainforests of Brazil. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, star-like arrangement of leaflets. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of white\u8338. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and organic-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Griffinia colatinensis is considered a vulnerable species."
