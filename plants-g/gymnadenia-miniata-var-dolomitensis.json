    "intro": "Gymnadenia miniata var. dolomitensis, commonly known as the Dolomitic Grass of Parma, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Dolomites of northern Italy. It is characterized by its compact stature, with slender stems and small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in calcareous soils and is adapted to the harsh, alpine conditions of its mountainous habitat. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and exhibits typical orchid features such as a single ovary and specialized pollination mechanisms. Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
