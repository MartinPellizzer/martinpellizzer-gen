It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, spiral-shaped pods and small, pea-like flowers. Guaicaia species are typically shrubs or small trees, often adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. They play an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various desert wildlife."
