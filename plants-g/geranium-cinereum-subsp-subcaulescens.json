    "intro": "Geranium cinereum subsp. subcaulescens, commonly known as the slender-stemmed geranium, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features upright, slender stems that are often hairy, with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to violet flowers with five petals, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and prolonged flowering period."
