    "intro": "Gagea fascicularis, commonly known as the clustered gagea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Liliaceae. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in woodland habitats, particularly in the eastern United States. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and bears bell-shaped, white or pale pink flowers in early spring. Its bulbs are small and clustered, which is a distinguishing feature of the species. Gagea fascicularis is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to partial shade environments."
