    "intro": "Grevillea calcicola, commonly known as the limestone grevillea, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, recurved leaves and vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils, often found on limestone outcrops. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by birds, particularly honeyeaters, due to their nectar-rich structure. Grevillea calcicola is an important component of the local flora and is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
