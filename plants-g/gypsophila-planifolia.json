    "intro": "Gypsophila planifolia, commonly known as the flatleaf baby's breath, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and prefers well-drained soil in full sun. Its foliage consists of narrow, linear leaves that are usually gray-green in color. Gypsophila planifolia is often used in floral arrangements due to its delicate appearance and ability to add volume to bouquets."
