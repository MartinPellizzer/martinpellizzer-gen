    "intro": "Glyceria ochroleuca, commonly known as yellow glyceria, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and rivers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale yellow flowers. Its rhizomes are extensive, allowing it to spread and form dense mats in moist soils. Glyceria ochroleuca plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
