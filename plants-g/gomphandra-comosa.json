It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy leaves, which help it retain moisture in its native habitat. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and undergrowth. Gomphandra comosa is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological role."
