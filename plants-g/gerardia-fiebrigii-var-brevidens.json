It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale blue, blooming in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
