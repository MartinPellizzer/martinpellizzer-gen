It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that resembles a torch, typically in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant features a rosette of elongated, pointed leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. This variety is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
