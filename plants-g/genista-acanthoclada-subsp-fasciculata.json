    "intro": "Genista acanthoclada subsp. fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered broom, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, yellowish-green leaves that are often clustered at the base of the plant. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by narrow, elongated pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in horticulture for erosion control and as a decorative plant."
