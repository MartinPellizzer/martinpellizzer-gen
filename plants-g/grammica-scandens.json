    "intro": "Grammica scandens, commonly known as the climbing gram or creeping gram, is a perennial flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is typically found growing along forest edges, in disturbed soils, and in moist environments. Grammica scandens has a vigorous climbing habit, often using tendrils to ascend supports. Its seeds are encased in pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution in suitable habitats."
