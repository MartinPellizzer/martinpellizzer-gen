    "intro": "Gouania glabriuscula, commonly known as the smoothleaf gouania, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and the Caribbean. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually smooth and elliptical in shape. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its fruits are capsules that release tiny seeds. Gouania glabriuscula is often found in moist, sandy soils in disturbed areas such as roadsides and open woods."
