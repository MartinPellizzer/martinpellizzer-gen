    "intro": "Garnotia micrantha var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf garnotia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It features compact, rosette-forming foliage with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white or silver hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale pink to white, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is a sought-after plant among gardeners interested in native and drought-tolerant species."
