    "intro": "Gastrodia grandilabris, commonly known as the large-labied gastrodia, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrition. The plant produces a single, fleshy, yellowish-brown rhizome that is often harvested for its medicinal properties in traditional Chinese medicine. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and typically bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to habitat destruction and overharvesting, Gastrodia grandilabris is critically endangered and requires urgent conservation efforts."
