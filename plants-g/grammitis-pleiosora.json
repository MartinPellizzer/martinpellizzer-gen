    "intro": "Grammitis pleiosora, commonly known as the broad-leaf fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches in the understory of rainforests. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Grammitis pleiosora is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
