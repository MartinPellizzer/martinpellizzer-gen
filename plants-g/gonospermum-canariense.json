    "intro": "Gonospermum canariense, commonly known as the Canary Islands starflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its star-shaped, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red in color. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces fruits that are capsule-like in structure. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the semi-arid climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
