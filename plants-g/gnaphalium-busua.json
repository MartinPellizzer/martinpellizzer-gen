    "intro": "Gnaphalium busua, commonly known as the white cudweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to regions of Africa, including South Africa, where it thrives in various habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense heads, giving it a fluffy appearance. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Gnaphalium busua is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and healing properties."
