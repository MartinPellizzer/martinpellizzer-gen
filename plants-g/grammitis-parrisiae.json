It is a small, delicate fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rock crevices. The plant has slender, arching fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure, and its spores are produced on the underside of the leaves. Grammitis parrisiae is characterized by its leathery, dark green foliage and is often found in association with other epiphytic plants. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a notable species in New Zealand's botanical diversity."
