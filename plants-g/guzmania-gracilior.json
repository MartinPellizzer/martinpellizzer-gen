    "intro": "Guzmania gracilior, commonly known as the slender pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange and yellow. Its foliage is typically bright green with a waxy texture, and it thrives in bright, indirect light. Guzmania gracilior is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
