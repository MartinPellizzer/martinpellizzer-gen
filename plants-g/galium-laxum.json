It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant has small, opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are pale yellow to white, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Galium laxum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks."
