These plants are characterized by their showy, often colorful flowers and milky sap, which contains toxic compounds. They are native to various regions in Africa, southern Europe, and parts of Asia. The flowers are typically clustered in umbels and attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and butterflies. Gomphocarpus species are often used in traditional medicine and have ecological importance as host plants for certain butterfly species."
