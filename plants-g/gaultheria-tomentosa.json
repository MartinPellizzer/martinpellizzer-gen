    "intro": "Gaultheria tomentosa, commonly known as the snowbank strawberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it survive in cold, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are edible and have a sweet, tangy flavor. These berries contain high levels of antioxidants and are often used in traditional medicine. Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh climates and a valuable species in ecological restoration projects."
