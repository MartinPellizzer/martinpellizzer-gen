    "intro": "Gothofreda birostrata, commonly known as the twin-beaked orchid, is a rare and unique species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. This plant belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated flower spikes that bear two prominent, beak-like structures. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically arranged in a rosette pattern, while the roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the rocky soil. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires specific conditions to bloom, making it a challenging plant to cultivate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gothofreda birostrata is considered a conservation concern."
