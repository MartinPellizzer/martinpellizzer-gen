    "intro": "Gymnogramma sinuata, commonly known as the sinuous holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds with a distinctive sinuous or wavy margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates, while its fronds are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Gymnogramma sinuata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage."
