    "intro": "Gastrosiphon subalpinus, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, showcasing its adaptation to harsh mountain environments. Its leaves are lanceolate and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in cold, windy conditions. Gastrosiphon subalpinus is often found in open meadows and slopes, where it thrives in full sun."
