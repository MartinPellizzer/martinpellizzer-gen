    "intro": "Gymnocalycium platygonum, commonly known as the flat-armed cactus, is a species native to Argentina. It is a small, globular cactus with a ribbed stem that typically grows up to 15 centimeters in height. The plant produces pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered at the top of the stem. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Gymnocalycium platygonum is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
