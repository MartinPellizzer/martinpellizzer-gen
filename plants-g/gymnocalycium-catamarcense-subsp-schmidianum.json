    "intro": "Gymnocalycium catamarcense subsp. schmidianum, commonly known as the Catamarca moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to Argentina. It is characterized by its globular to cylindrical stem, which is often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise desolate appearance. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for succulent enthusiasts. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
