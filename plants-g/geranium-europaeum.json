    "intro": "Geranium europaeum, commonly known as the European geranium, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, with erect, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky areas. Geranium europaeum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
