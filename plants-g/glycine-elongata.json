    "intro": "Glycine elongata, commonly known as the longpod bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It produces elongated, pod-like fruits that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length, containing several seeds. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. It is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil. Glycine elongata is also cultivated for its edible seeds, which are used in traditional cuisines."
