    "intro": "Geissois ternata var. glabrior, commonly known as the smoothleaf geissois, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a glossy surface. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
