    "intro": "Gypsophila adscendens, commonly known as the sweet pea flower or silk flower, is a member of the Carnation family (Caryophyllaceae). It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Middle East, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and clusters of small, fluffy, white or pink flowers that resemble miniature clouds. It typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. Gypsophila adscendens prefers full sun and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
