    "intro": "Gaultheria praticola, commonly known as the creeping wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features dense, glossy dark green leaves that remain throughout the year, providing ornamental value in shaded landscapes. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are edible for humans and wildlife. Its foliage contains aromatic compounds, including methyl salicylate, which contribute to its medicinal and culinary uses. Gaultheria praticola is well-suited for rock gardens and woodland settings due to its hardiness and compact growth habit."
