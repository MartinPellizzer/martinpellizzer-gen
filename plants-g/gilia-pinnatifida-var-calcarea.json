    "intro": "Gilia pinnatifida var. calcarea, commonly known as the limestone gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on limestone soils, which influence its distribution and morphology. Its leaves are pinnately divided, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. This species is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in harsh, dry climates."
