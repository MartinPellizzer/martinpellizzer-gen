    "intro": "Galium aparine var. thalassicum, commonly known as seaside bedstraw, is a variant of the bedstraw plant adapted to coastal environments. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines. The plant features small, opposite leaves and produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers. Its fruits are small, dry capsules that release seeds through a mechanism called elaiosomes, aiding in seed dispersal by ants. This variety is notable for its tolerance to salt spray and wind, making it a characteristic species of maritime ecosystems."
