    "intro": "Galenia filiformis, commonly known as the slender galenia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in open, sunny areas such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. The plant features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its small, white or pale purple flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which bloom in spring. The leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
