    "intro": "Galactia camporum, commonly known as the purple milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy purple or pink flowers. The plant produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain seeds, and it often grows in dry, rocky habitats. Galactia camporum is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological importance in native ecosystems."
