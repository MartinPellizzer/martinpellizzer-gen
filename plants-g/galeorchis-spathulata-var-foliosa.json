It features a dense, mat-forming growth habit with fleshy, dark green leaves that are broad and ovate. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers in late spring, typically in clusters at the base of the leaves. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in woodland gardens."
