    "intro": "Glechoma canescens, commonly known as creeping Jenny, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its creeping habit and ability to spread rapidly make it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in garden settings."
