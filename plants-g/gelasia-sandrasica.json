    "intro": "Gelasia sandrasica, commonly known as the Sandrasic Ghostflower, is a rare and delicate plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that reflect light, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night, emitting a faint bioluminescent glow. Its root system is highly adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in extreme drought conditions. Due to habitat loss, Gelasia sandrasica is critically endangered and is protected in several conservation reserves."
