    "intro": "Guzmania acuminata, commonly known as the flame plant, is a striking epiphytic bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful inflorescence that resembles a flame, which can range from red to orange and yellow. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, forming a central pool used for attracting insects. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. Guzmania acuminata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to flourish."
