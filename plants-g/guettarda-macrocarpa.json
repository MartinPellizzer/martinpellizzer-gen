    "intro": "Guettarda macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited guettarda, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a glossy surface. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange to red berries containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate. Guettarda macrocarpa is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and flowering habit."
