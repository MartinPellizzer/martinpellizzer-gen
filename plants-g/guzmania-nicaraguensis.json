    "intro": "Guzmania nicaraguensis, commonly known as the Nicaraguan torch, is a striking bromeliad native to Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant, red-brown bracts that resemble a torch, giving it its common name. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect rainwater, creating a small pool that supports various microorganisms and small animals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Guzmania nicaraguensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is popular in horticultural collections."
