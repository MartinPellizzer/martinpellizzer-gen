    "intro": "Gentiana glacialis var. pumila, commonly known as the alpine gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in high-altitude meadows and rocky areas, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy layer, which helps reduce water loss. The species is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in alpine gardens for its beauty and hardiness."
