    "intro": "Gnaphalium insulare, commonly known as the island cudweed, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a low-growing herbaceous plant that typically forms dense mats or cushions, often found in rocky or coastal areas. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and yellow centers, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are usually narrow, silvery-gray, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Gnaphalium insulare is known for its aromatic properties and is often used in traditional herbal medicine."
