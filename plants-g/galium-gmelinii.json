    "intro": "Galium gmelinii, commonly known as lesser bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, hairy stems that often lie close to the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and covered in fine hairs. Galium gmelinii thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats."
