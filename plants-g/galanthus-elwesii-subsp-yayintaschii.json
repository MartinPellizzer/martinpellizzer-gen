    "intro": "Galanthus elwesii subsp. yayintaschii, commonly known as the Yayinta\u015f Galanthus, is a rare and striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family. Native to the mountainous regions of Turkey, this subspecies is characterized by its large, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 15\u201320 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous base. It prefers well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
