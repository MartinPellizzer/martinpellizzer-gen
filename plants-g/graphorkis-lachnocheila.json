It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features delicate, strap-like leaves and produces showy, yellowish-orange flowers with a distinctive, fragrant aroma. Its unique coloration and structure make it a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable in its natural range."
