    "intro": "Grammitis albidula, commonly known as the white-stemmed hound's-tongue, is a fern native to the temperate regions of the southern hemisphere. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its slender, pale green fronds that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Grammitis albidula is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded gardens."
