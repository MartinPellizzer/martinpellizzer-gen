    "intro": "Gnaphalium chartaceum, commonly known as paperleaf everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its finely divided, silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a papery texture. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, appearing in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
