It is a perennial legume native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant features trifoliate leaves and produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes. Its fruit is a cylindrical pod that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation.
