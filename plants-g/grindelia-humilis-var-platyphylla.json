It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, resinous capsules that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland deserts. Its unique morphology and adaptations make it well-suited for arid environments."
