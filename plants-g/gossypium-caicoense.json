    "intro": "Gossypium caicoense, commonly known as the Cai\u00e7\u00f3 cotton, is a wild cotton species native to Brazil. It is characterized by its fibrous seed capsules and hairy leaves, typical of the Malvaceae family. The plant produces fluffy, white fibers that are used for textile purposes, though it is less commercially cultivated than other cotton species. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in dry and semi-arid regions. Due to its genetic diversity, it is of interest for breeding programs aimed at improving cotton resilience and yield."
