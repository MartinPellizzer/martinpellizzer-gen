    "intro": "Gasteria humilis, commonly known as the dwarf gasteria, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, dark green leaves that are often adorned with white or yellow markings. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers on tall, erect stems during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Gasteria humilis is valued for its compact size and ornamental appeal in both indoor and outdoor settings."
