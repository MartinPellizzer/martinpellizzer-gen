    "intro": "Gnaphalium glanduliferum, commonly known as the glandular cudweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster, with glandular hairs covering its stems and leaves, giving it its scientific name. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. The plant is also known for producing a sticky secretion from its glandular structures, which can attract certain insects."
