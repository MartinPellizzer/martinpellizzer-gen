    "intro": "Grammitis flavescens, commonly known as the yellow moss or golden fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on trees in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has delicate, feather-like fronds that are usually bright green, with a yellowish tinge on the underside. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Grammitis flavescens thrives in humid environments and is often found in shaded, moist forest areas."
