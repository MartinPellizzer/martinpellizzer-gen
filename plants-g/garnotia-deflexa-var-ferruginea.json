It features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, rusty-colored pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and prefers full sun exposure. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a drought-tolerant ground cover."
