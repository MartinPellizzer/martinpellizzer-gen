It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Galium arcuatum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
