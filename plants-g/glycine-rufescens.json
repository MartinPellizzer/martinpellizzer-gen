    "intro": "Glycine rufescens, commonly known as the scarlet poinsettia, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its striking red bracts that surround small, yellowish flowers, which are actually the true flowers of the plant. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Glycine rufescens thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant foliage and festive appearance during the holiday season."
