It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, a common adaptation in arid environments. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its delicate appearance and unique growth habit make it a subject of interest in botanical studies and ecological research."
