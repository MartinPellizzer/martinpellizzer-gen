It has a trailing growth habit with hairy, ovate leaves and produces small, yellow flowers. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds. Glycine humifusa is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is valued for its nitrogen-fixing capabilities. It is also used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop."
