    "intro": "Gentiana triflora f. alboviolacea, commonly known as the white-violet gentian, is a rare and striking botanical variant of the gentian family. It is characterized by its pale blue to white flowers, which contrast sharply with its dark green foliage. This subspecies is native to the alpine regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 cm, with three prominent leaves and a single flower cluster. Its botanical significance lies in its unique coloration and its role in alpine ecosystems."
