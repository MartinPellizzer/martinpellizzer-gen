    "intro": "Geonoma wendlandii, commonly known as Wendland's fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Geonoma wendlandii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
