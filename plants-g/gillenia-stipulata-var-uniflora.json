It features a basal rosette of large, waxy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces a single, showy white or pale yellow flower at the end of each stem during late spring to early summer. Its flowers have prominent, showy stamens that are often mistaken for petals. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
