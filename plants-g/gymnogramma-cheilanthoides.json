    "intro": "Gymnogramma cheilanthoides, commonly known as the feather fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble feathers, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective layer called an indusium. Gymnogramma cheilanthoides is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid conditions."
