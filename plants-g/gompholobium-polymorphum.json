    "intro": "Gompholobium polymorphum, commonly known as the variable glorybower, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow to orange flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments, and it produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Gompholobium polymorphum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
