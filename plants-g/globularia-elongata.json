    "intro": "Globularia elongata, commonly known as the longstem globularia, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often used in rock gardens due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal. Globularia elongata is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
