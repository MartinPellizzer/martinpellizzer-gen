    "intro": "Gliricidia maculata var. multijuga, commonly known as the dwarf gliricidia, is a fast-growing leguminous shrub native to tropical regions. It features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pale yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant is characterized by its robust root system, which helps prevent soil erosion. It is often used in agroforestry and as a forage crop due to its high nitrogen-fixing ability. Its adaptability to various soil types makes it a valuable species in ecological restoration projects."
