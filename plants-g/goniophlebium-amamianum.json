    "intro": "Goniophlebium amamianum, commonly known as the Amami fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Amami Islands of Japan. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a distinctive, intricate venation pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in forest understories. Its spores are released from terminal clusters called sori, which are protected by a membranous covering. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
