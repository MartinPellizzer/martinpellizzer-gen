    "intro": "Gaultheria pernettyoides, commonly known as the dwarf strawberry bush, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern South America. It features dark green, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape and emit a subtle aromatic scent. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, edible berries resembling strawberries. These berries are rich in antioxidants and contain the compound methyl salicylate, which gives them their distinctive medicinal properties. Gaultheria pernettyoides is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
