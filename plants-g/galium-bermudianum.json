It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers clustered in whorls along the stems. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and covered in fine hairs. Galium bermudianum is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and thrives in coastal and disturbed environments."
