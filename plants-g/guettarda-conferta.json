    "intro": "Guettarda conferta, commonly known as the tropical shrub or beach hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant thrives in coastal areas and is often found in sandy or rocky soils due to its salt tolerance. Its roots help stabilize soil and prevent erosion, making it valuable in ecological restoration projects. Guettarda conferta is also cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and vibrant blooms."
