    "intro": "Geranium multicaule, commonly known as the clustered geranium, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features upright stems that often branch near the base, supporting clusters of opposite leaves that are typically heart-shaped or ovate. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of red, pink, or white, which bloom from summer to autumn. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Geranium multicaule is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
