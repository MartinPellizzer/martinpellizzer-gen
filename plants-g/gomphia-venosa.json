    "intro": "Gomphia venosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf gomphia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily in moist, well-drained soils. Gomphia venosa is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments."
