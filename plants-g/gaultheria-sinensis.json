    "intro": "Gaultheria sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to China. It features dense, dark green foliage and produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring. The plant is notable for its aromatic leaves, which contain methyl salicylate, giving it a peppermint-like scent. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest areas. Gaultheria sinensis is valued both for its ornamental qualities and its use in traditional medicine."
