    "intro": "Gnaphalium dominici-saccardoi, commonly known as the Dominici-Saccardoi feather grass, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery inflorescences and narrow, grass-like leaves. This species is native to specific regions in southern Europe, particularly in Italy and parts of the Balkans. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered plant species."
