It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which typically bloom in late summer. The plant has slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to cold, mountainous environments. It thrives in moist, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and subalpine zones. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
