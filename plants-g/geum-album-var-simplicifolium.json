    "intro": "Geum album var. simplicifolium, commonly known as white avens, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features simple, alternate leaves that are typically rounded or heart-shaped with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters at the ends of stems, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate foliage and subtle floral display."
