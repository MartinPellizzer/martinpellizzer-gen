    "intro": "Geonoma acaulis, commonly known as the stemless bracken fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and the absence of a visible stem, with leaves arising directly from the rootstock. The fronds are typically dark green, lance-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine, soft hairs. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant's unique morphology and adaptability make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
