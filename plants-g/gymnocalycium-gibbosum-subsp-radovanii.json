    "intro": "Gymnocalycium gibbosum subsp. radovanii, commonly known as the Radovanii's moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of northern Argentina. It is characterized by its globular to cylindrical stems, which are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly spines. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months. It is a succulent plant that stores water in its thick, fleshy stems, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
