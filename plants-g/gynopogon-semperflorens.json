    "intro": "Gynopogon semperflorens, commonly known as the everlasting flower, is a perennial plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, tightly packed florets that retain their color and form for an extended period, giving it its common name. The plant has a compact, cushion-like growth habit with hairy, silver-gray foliage. It produces bright yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The botanical features of Gynopogon semperflorens make it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
