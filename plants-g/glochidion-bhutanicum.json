    "intro": "Glochidion bhutanicum, commonly known as the Bhutanese glochidion, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Himalayan region, particularly Bhutan. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
