    "intro": "Gaultheria lancifolia var. dulcis, commonly known as the sweet wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features dark green, elliptical leaves that are glossy and emit a minty aroma when crushed. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall. These fruits are edible and contain a high concentration of methyl salicylate, giving them their characteristic wintergreen scent. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest environments."
