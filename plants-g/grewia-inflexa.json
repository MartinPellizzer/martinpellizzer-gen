    "intro": "Grewia inflexa, commonly known as the red sandalwood or red gum tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually green with a slight reddish tinge on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. Grewia inflexa is valued for its ornamental appearance and its role in local ecosystems."
