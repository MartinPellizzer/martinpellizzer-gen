    "intro": "Grammitis lepida, commonly known as the slender harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Grammitis lepida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
