    "intro": "Gymnanthera fruticosa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces dark red or black berries that are edible but often used in traditional medicine. Its wood is valued for its durability and unique scent, though it is also subject to overharvesting. Gymnanthera fruticosa thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil."
