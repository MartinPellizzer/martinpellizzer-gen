    "intro": "Goniopteris multigemmifera, commonly known as the multiflowering water fern, is a member of the family Pteridaceae. It is a perennial fern characterized by its large, compound fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The plant's reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation."
