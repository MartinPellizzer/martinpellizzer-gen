    "intro": "Garrya fadyenii, commonly known as the coastal mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. It thrives in coastal chaparral and scrub habitats, often growing on the branches of other trees. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
