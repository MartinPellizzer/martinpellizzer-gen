    "intro": "Gomphia multiflora, commonly known as the African feather grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its distinctive, feathery appearance due to its long, thin leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, typical of the grass family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or along riverbanks. Gomphia multiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
