    "intro": "Geranium strigellum, commonly known as the dwarf geranium, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Africa. It features compact, upright growth with small, dark green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of delicate, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming from spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
