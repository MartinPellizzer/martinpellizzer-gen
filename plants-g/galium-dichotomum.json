    "intro": "Galium dichotomum, commonly known as two-branched bedstraw, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, branching stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs. Its small, white or pale pink flowers appear in clusters and bloom from late spring to early summer. The leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and have a slightly hairy surface, contributing to its distinctive botanical appearance."
