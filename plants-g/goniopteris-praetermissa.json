    "intro": "Goniopteris praetermissa, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, strap-like fronds that are typically less than 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky cliffs or in forest undergrowth. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Goniopteris praetermissa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
