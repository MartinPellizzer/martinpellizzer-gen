    "intro": "Galium aparine var. minor, commonly known as cleavers, is a low-growing herbaceous plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that are covered in fine, hooked hairs, which aid in its ability to cling to surfaces. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are opposite, heart-shaped, and have a serrated margin, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Galium aparine var. minor is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is commonly used in traditional herbal medicine."
