    "intro": "Genista spiniflora, commonly known as the prickly broom, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by spiny, woody pods that contain seeds. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as an ornamental plant."
