    "intro": "Glandularia radicans, commonly known as creeping stick, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with slender, branching stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite and covered in fine, glandular hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Glandularia radicans is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
