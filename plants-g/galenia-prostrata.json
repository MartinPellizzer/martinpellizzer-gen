    "intro": "Galenia prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate galenia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features a mat-forming habit with creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. Galenia prostrata is often found in coastal and inland grasslands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
