    "intro": "Gentianella sylvicola, commonly known as the forest gentian, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in partially to fully shaded conditions. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a rough texture, while its stems are slender and hairy. Gentianella sylvicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
