    "intro": "Gnetum griffithii, commonly known as the Himalayan gnetum, is a flowering plant belonging to the gymnosperm group, though it exhibits some angiosperm-like features. It is native to the temperate regions of the Himalayas and is characterized by its unique morphology, including scale-like leaves and a woody structure. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female structures. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, cup-like structure, a trait that is uncommon among gymnosperms. Gnetum griffithii plays a role in its ecosystem as a food source for certain insects and animals."
