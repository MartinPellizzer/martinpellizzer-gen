It consists of several species, primarily found in North America, particularly in the western United States. The plants are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from yellow to red. They typically grow in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Gakenia species are often used in native plant gardens due to their ornamental value and ecological benefits."
