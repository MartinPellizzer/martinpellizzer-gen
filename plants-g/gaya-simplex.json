    "intro": "Gaya simplex, commonly known as the slender lady's tresses, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and its clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its roots are fibrous and help it anchor in the soil while absorbing nutrients. Gaya simplex is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts of rare orchids."
