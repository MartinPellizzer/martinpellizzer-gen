    "intro": "Gastrochilus jenkinsii, commonly known as Jenkins' stomach orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, often fragrant flowers that are typically pale green to white in color. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with rhizomes that produce a cluster of leaves and flowering stems. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
