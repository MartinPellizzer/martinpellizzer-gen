    "intro": "Gordonia elliptica, commonly known as the narrowleaf beech, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by woody, cone-like fruits that contain smooth, oval seeds. Its bark is thick and flaky, often exuding a sticky substance. Gordonia elliptica is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
