    "intro": "Geijera salicifolia, commonly known as the silky ash or silky tamarind, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and compound leaves that are alternate and pinnate. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in coastal and dry forest areas. Geijera salicifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in Indigenous Australian cultures."
