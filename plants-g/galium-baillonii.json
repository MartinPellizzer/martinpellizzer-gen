    "intro": "Galium baillonii, commonly known as Bailloni's bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid regions of North America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces tiny white or pale pink flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Galium baillonii is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in harsh, sun-exposed environments."
