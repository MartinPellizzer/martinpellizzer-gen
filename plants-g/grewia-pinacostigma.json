    "intro": "Grewia pinacostigma, commonly known as the red-hot poker or fireplant, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, red bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a slightly serrated edge. Grewia pinacostigma is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
