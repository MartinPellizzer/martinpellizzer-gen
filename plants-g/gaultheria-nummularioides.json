    "intro": "Gaultheria nummularioides, commonly known as the dwarf wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features small, round, glossy dark green leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in diameter. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for humans and wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. Gaultheria nummularioides is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
