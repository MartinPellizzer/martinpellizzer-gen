    "intro": "Guazuma tomentosa var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved guazuma, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in traditional medicine."
