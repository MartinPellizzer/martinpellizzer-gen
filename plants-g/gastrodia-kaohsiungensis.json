    "intro": "Gastrodia kaohsiungensis, commonly known as the Kaohsiung gastrodia, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to Taiwan. It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it relies entirely on fungal networks for its nutrients, lacking chlorophyll. The plant produces unique, fleshy, and often reddish-brown tubers that are its primary vegetative structures. It typically grows in shaded, humid environments within mountain forests. Due to habitat destruction and overharvesting, conservation efforts are critical for its survival."
