    "intro": "Goniophlebium deltoideum, commonly known as the delta fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on trees or rocks in humid environments. The plant has delicate, deltoid-shaped fronds that are divided into narrow, linear segments. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate. The plant's foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
