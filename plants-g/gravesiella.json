    "intro": "Gravesiella, commonly known as the \"skeleton weed,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its small, often inconspicuous flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, where it thrives in sandy or saline soils. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas along shorelines. Gravesiella species are often considered invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
