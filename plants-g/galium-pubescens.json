    "intro": "Galium pubescens, commonly known as hairy bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny white or pinkish flowers, which are typically arranged in umbels. Galium pubescens thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its presence is often an indicator of undisturbed, ecologically rich habitats."
