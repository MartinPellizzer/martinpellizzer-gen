    "intro": "Gagea pratensis, commonly known as the meadow gagea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pale blue flowers. Its bulbs are underground, storing nutrients for the plant's survival through winter. Gagea pratensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
