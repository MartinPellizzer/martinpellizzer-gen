    "intro": "Grammitis flagellipinnata, commonly known as the whiplash fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are usually short and narrow, with a distinctive whiplike arrangement of pinnae. Grammitis flagellipinnata is noted for its ability to thrive in high humidity and is often found in cloud forests."
