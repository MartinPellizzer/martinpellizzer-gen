    "intro": "Grevillea commutata var. pinnatisecta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved grevillea, is a species native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, pinnatisected leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Grevillea genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal gardens. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract native pollinators."
