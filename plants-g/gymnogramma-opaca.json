    "intro": "Gymnogramma opaca, commonly known as the broad-leafed spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically bright green and have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Gymnogramma opaca is often found growing in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. It is a relatively small fern, usually reaching heights of only a few centimeters."
