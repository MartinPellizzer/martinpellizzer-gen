    "intro": "Glyceria fordeana, commonly known as the Forde's glyceria, is a perennial grass species native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are characteristic of the Poaceae family. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms. Glyceria fordeana is also valued for its ornamental appeal in wetland restoration projects."
