    "intro": "Geonoma tomentosa, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, compact fronds covered in a fine, woolly layer of hairs, giving it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity and partial shade. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to form dense clumps that help stabilize soil in its natural habitat. The fronds are usually leathery and dark green, with a broad, shield-like shape that contributes to its common name."
