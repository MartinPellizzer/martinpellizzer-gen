    "intro": "Geranium grandistipulatum, commonly known as the large-leaved geranium, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and drought tolerance."
