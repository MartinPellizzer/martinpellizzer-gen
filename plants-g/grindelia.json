These plants are native to the western United States and are characterized by their resinous, sticky leaves and showy yellow flower heads. They often grow in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and coastal dunes. Grindelia species are known for their ability to tolerate arid conditions and poor soil, making them resilient in harsh environments. Some species are used in traditional medicine and have been studied for their potential medicinal properties."
