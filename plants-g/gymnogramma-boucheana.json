It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit. The plant features rhizomatous growth and produces small, ovate, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern.

Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, which are released during the humid months."
