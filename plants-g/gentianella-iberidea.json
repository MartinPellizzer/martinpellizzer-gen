It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in mountainous regions. It has lance-shaped leaves and is often found in open woodlands and meadows. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
