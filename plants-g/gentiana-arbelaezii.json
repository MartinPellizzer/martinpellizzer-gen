    "intro": "Gentiana arbelaezii, commonly known as the Arbel\u00e1ez's gentian, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet petals, which are typically five to seven in number and arranged in a showy, radial pattern. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine regions, where it forms compact, herbaceous growths. Its flowers bloom during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gentiana arbelaezii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
