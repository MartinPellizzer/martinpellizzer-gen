    "intro": "Goodyera polygonoides, commonly known as the polygon-like maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its intricate, fern-like foliage with finely divided leaves that resemble the structure of a polygon. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories where it forms a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species in many parts of its range."
