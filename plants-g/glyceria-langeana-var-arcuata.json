It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brownish flowers, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in wetland environments, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Due to its adaptability, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
