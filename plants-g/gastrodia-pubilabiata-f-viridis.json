    "intro": "Gastrodia pubilabiata f. viridis, commonly known as the green-flowered form of the mountain gastrodia, is a rare and unique variant of the gastrodia plant. It is characterized by its distinctive greenish-yellow flowers, which differ from the typical brownish hues of the species. This fern-like orchid is native to the high-altitude regions of China, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant is known for its fleshy, tuberous roots, which are often used in traditional medicine. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
