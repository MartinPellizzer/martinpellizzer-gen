    "intro": "Glyceria distans var. arctica, commonly known as arctic glyceria, is a perennial grass species native to cold climates of the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of fine hairs. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and wetland habitats. Its flowering spikes are usually small and inconspicuous, producing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Glyceria distans var. arctica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various arctic invertebrates."
