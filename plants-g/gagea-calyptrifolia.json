    "intro": "Gagea calyptrifolia, commonly known as the hooded gagea, is a small perennial bulbous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of white or pale blue flowers. The plant produces a distinctive, hood-shaped bract that covers the base of the flower, giving it its common name. It thrives in woodland habitats and prefers well-drained, sandy soils. Gagea calyptrifolia is often found in California and Oregon, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its native ecosystems."
