    "intro": "Goodenia genuflexa, commonly known as the prostrate goodenia, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender, often sprawling stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its foliage. It thrives in well-drained sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often appreciated in native gardens and conservation efforts."
