    "intro": "Geonoma cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf geonoma, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds with a narrow, elongated shape. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil while absorbing nutrients. The leaves are usually evergreen, providing a consistent green appearance throughout the year."
