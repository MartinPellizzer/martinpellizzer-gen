    "intro": "Gentiana speciosissima, commonly known as the beautiful gentian, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and features lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, often found in alpine meadows and forested areas. The flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitats."
