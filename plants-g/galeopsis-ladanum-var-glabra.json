    "intro": "Galeopsis ladanum var. glabra, commonly known as smooth hedge nettle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and opposite leaves that are lance-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it is considered a weed in many regions."
