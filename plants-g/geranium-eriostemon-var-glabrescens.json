    "intro": "Geranium eriostemon var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smoothleaf geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It features upright stems that are often hairy but become smooth as the plant matures. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a slightly serrated edge, while the overall growth habit is compact and bushy. It is well-suited for rock gardens and borders due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
