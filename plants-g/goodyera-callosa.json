    "intro": "Goodyera callosa, commonly known as the pink millepora or ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically growing on the trunks of trees in the Appalachian region. The plant has small, dark green leaves and produces striking, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and decaying organic matter. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of forest health."
