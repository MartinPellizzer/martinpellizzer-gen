    "intro": "Glossoloma panamense, commonly known as the Panamanian ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the humid lowland forests of Panama. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has a short, fleshy stem and produces small, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to absorb moisture from the air. Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Glossoloma panamense is considered a vulnerable species."
