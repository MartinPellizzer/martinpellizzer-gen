It is characterized by its hairy, silver-green leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature. It thrives in warm, sunny environments and is often found in coastal regions and savannas. The fruit is edible, though some varieties are sour and are used in local cuisines or traditional medicine."
