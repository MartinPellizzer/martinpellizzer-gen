It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is native to the Balkan region, particularly Bulgaria. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and thrives in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in late summer, adding a unique aesthetic to its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical studies."
