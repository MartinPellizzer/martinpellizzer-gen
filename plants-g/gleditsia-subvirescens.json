    "intro": "Gleditsia subvirescens, commonly known as the honey locust, is a deciduous legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves that are often reduced to small leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters, which are followed by long, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and is adapted to a variety of soil types. The honey locust is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in landscaping."
