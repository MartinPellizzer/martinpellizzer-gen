    "intro": "Grammitis australis var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf rock fern, is a compact, low-growing fern native to Australia. It features delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments, often found in rock crevices or on shaded forest floors. Its rhizomes form dense mats, helping to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often used in horticultural displays due to its lush, green appearance."
