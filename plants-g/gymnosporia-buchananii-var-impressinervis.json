It is characterized by its spiny stems and compound leaves with a distinctive venation pattern. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by woody, cone-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its thorny structure, it is often used as a living fence or for erosion control."
