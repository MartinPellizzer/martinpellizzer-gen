    "intro": "Gomphrena pulchella f. simplex, commonly known as the simple plume flower, is a compact, herbaceous annual plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its vibrant, feathery bracts that range in color from pink to red, which are not true flowers but modified leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the center of the bract clusters. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its drought tolerance and extended bloom period make it a valuable addition to low-maintenance gardens."
