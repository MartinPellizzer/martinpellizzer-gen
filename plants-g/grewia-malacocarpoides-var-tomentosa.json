    "intro": "Grewia malacocarpoides var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly buttercup, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by spherical, red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy habitats. The varietal name *tomentosa* refers to the dense, woolly covering on its foliage."
