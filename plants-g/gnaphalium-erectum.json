    "intro": "Gnaphalium erectum, commonly known as the upright everlasting flower, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features slender, upright stems covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its small, pale yellow to white flowers bloom in summer, and the plant is often used in floral arrangements due to its long-lasting nature. Gnaphalium erectum thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is commonly found in meadows and along roadsides."
