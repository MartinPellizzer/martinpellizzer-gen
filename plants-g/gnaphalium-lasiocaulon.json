    "intro": "Gnaphalium lasiocaulon, commonly known as the woolly cudweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a dense mat of silver-gray, soft, and fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flower heads arranged in clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its hairy stems and leaves are adapted for moisture retention and protection against herbivory. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and rocky areas."
