    "intro": "Gnomonia elatior, commonly known as the tall gnomonia, is a member of the Rhabdastomatales order and is primarily found in temperate regions. It is a parasitic plant that typically grows on the roots of other plants, drawing nutrients from its host. The plant has a simple, herbaceous structure with small, inconspicuous leaves. It produces cup-like structures called pseudothecia, which contain the reproductive organs. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a minor role in ecological systems but is of interest to mycologists and botanists."
