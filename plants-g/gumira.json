    "intro": "Gumira, commonly known as *Cephalanthera damasonium*, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia, often found in woodland habitats. Gumira lacks true leaves and instead has modified leaves called bracts that enclose the flowers. It is also known for its ability to thrive in shaded environments and its unique method of obtaining nutrients through mycorrhizal associations with fungi."
