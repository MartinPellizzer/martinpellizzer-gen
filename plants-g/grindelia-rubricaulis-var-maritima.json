It is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy, glandular leaves that produce a sticky resin. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal climates with salt spray and strong winds. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native insects. Its resin has been used historically by indigenous peoples for various purposes, including as a medicinal and adhesive substance."
