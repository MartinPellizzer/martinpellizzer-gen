    "intro": "Gonocormus ruwenzoriensis, commonly known as the Ruwenzori orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of fragrant, white or pale blue flowers. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and high humidity. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to the harsh conditions of its alpine habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
