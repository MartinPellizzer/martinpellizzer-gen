    "intro": "Gymnogramma domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Hypnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, ovate to lanceolate fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in a single row along the veins. Gymnogramma domingensis is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in the Caribbean and parts of Central America."
