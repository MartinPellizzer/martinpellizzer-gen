    "intro": "Gymnanthemum metzianum, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, often found in rocky or arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually succulent and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. Gymnanthemum metzianum is native to regions of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun."
