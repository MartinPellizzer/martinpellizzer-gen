    "intro": "Gongylolepis, commonly known as the mountain holly or the red holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to the southern United States and Mexico. The plants are characterized by their evergreen leaves, which are often glossy and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. They produce small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pink, followed by bright red berries. Gongylolepis species are adapted to grow in acidic, well-drained soils and are often found in rocky or mountainous regions."
