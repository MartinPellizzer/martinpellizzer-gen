    "intro": "Gymnogramma distans, commonly known as the broad-leafed rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its leathery, lance-shaped leaves that are often divided into narrow segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. Gymnogramma distans has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are released during the dry season."
