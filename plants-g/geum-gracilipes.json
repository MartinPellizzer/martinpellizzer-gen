It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky slopes. The plant features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine, hairy hairs. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, and range in color from white to pinkish-red. The leaves are palmately divided, with a delicate, fern-like appearance, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens."
