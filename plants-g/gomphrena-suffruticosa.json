    "intro": "Gomphrena suffruticosa, commonly known as the frostweed or silverleaf gomphrena, is a perennial shrub native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of small, spiky, pink or red flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its foliage is covered in a fine, silvery-white down, giving it a distinctive appearance. Gomphrena suffruticosa is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
