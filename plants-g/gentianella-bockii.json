    "intro": "Gentianella bockii, commonly known as Bock's gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained, rocky soils. The plant features a basal rosette of lanceolate, blue-green leaves and produces striking blue or violet flowers during the summer months. Its flowers are tubular with five lobes and are adapted for pollination by insects such as bees and butterflies. Gentianella bockii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in botanical gardens and wildflower meadows."
