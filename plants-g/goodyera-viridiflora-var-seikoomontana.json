    "intro": "Goodyera viridiflora var. seikoomontana, commonly known as the Seikoon Mountain green-flowered orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the high altitudes of Taiwan. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, shaded forest environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself in rocky substrates. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
