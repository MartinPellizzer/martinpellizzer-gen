    "intro": "Galinsoga trilobata, commonly known as common galinsoga, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with serrated edges and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces numerous tiny, three-lobed fruits called schizocarps, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in many regions."
