    "intro": "Gymnogramma flavens, commonly known as the golden kidney fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green with a slight yellowish hue. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Gymnogramma flavens has small, spore-bearing structures called sori that are located on the underside of its fronds. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and conservation efforts."
