    "intro": "Gnaphalium uliginosum, commonly known as the bog myrtle, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in the northern hemisphere. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms dense mats on moist, acidic soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs. It is often found in peat bogs and other waterlogged habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil. The plant is also known for its aromatic properties and has been used historically for various purposes, including as a source of incense."
