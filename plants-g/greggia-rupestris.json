    "intro": "Greggia rupestris, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, ribbed stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Greggia rupestris is valued for its low maintenance and ornamental appeal in dry climates."
