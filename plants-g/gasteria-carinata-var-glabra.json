    "intro": "Gasteria carinata var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth-leafed gasteria, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy, dark green leaves that are typically smooth and lack the prominent spines found in other gasteria varieties. The plant produces small, white flowers on tall, erect stems during the growing season. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Its compact growth habit makes it an attractive addition to rock gardens and indoor collections."
