    "intro": "Gagea calcicola, commonly known as the limestone gagea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the western United States. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils, particularly in areas with limestone substrates. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers during late spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often appearing after the flowers. Gagea calcicola is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy member of the Amaryllidaceae family."
