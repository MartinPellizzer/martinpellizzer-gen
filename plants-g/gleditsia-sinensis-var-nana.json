    "intro": "Gleditsia sinensis var. nana, commonly known as the Chinese honeylocust dwarf form, is a compact, ornamental tree or shrub native to China. It features compound leaves that are smaller and more delicate than those of the standard honeylocust, with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in racemes, which are followed by slender, woody pods containing flat, edible seeds. It is well-suited for small gardens due to its slow growth and tolerance of urban conditions. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture."
