    "intro": "Geonoma conduruensis, commonly known as the Brazilian fern, is a species of fern native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its rhizomes are relatively short, and it produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves. Geonoma conduruensis plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native habitat, contributing to the understory vegetation."
