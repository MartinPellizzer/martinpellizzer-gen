    "intro": "Glyptopetalum zeylanicum var. brevipedicellatum, commonly known as the short-stemmed rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or pale purple, arranged in clusters at the base of the stems. It thrives in rocky or limestone-rich soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the orchid family."
