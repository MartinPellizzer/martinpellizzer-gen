    "intro": "Gyrostachys novifuburgensis, commonly known as the New Fuburg sunflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its vibrant yellow composite flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, and it produces small, achene-like seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
