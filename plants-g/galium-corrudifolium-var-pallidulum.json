It features slender stems that often lie prostrate on the ground, covered with fine, soft hairs. The leaves are opposite, elliptical to ovate in shape, and have a pale green coloration, giving the plant its common name. Its small, white to pale pink flowers appear in clusters during the summer months. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks."
