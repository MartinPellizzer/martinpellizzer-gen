It features slender, spreading stems covered in fine, silver-white hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers clustered in loose cymes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Galium demissum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks."
