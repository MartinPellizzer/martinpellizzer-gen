    "intro": "Grammitis arche, commonly known as the ancient fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Grammitis arche plays an important ecological role in maintaining forest floor biodiversity."
