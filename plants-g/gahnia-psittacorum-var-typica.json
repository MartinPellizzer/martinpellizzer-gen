It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically borne on slender stalks. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
