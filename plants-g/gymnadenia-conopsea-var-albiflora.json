    "intro": "Gymnadenia conopsea var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered grass pinks, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous grasslands and meadows, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. This variety is distinguished by its pale floral coloration, which sets it apart from the more common red or pink-flowered forms of Gymnadenia conopsea."
