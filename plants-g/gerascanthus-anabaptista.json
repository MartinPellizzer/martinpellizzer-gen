    "intro": "Gerascanthus anabaptista, commonly known as the sacred flame plant, is a rare flowering species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its striking red and orange tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a woody stem with thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its unique floral structure attracts specific pollinators, such as hummingbirds and bees. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
