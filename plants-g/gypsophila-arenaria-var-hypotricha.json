    "intro": "Gypsophila arenaria var. hypotricha, commonly known as the sand gypsophila, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and clusters of small, fluffy white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rocky or sandy environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine, hair-like structures. This variety is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
