    "intro": "Glyceria catabrosa, commonly known as the slender glyceria, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marsh environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense stands that help stabilize shorelines. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It is often found in areas with standing water, such as pond edges and wet meadows. Glyceria catabrosa plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
