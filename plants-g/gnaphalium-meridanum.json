It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Gnaphalium meridanum is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it contributes to the biodiversity of these high-altitude ecosystems."
