    "intro": "Glandularia microphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved glandularia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which can deter herbivores. The plant produces spikes of bright red or purple flowers, typically blooming in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
