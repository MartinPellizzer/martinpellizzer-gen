    "intro": "Geum ciliatum var. triflorum, commonly known as the three-flowered avens, is a herbaceous perennial native to the northern regions of North America. It features basal leaves that are palmately lobed with soft, hairy surfaces, and its stems are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters of three, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive and ecologically valuable species in its native habitat."
