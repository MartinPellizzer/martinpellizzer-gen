    "intro": "Guettarda erosa, commonly known as the beach hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along shorelines. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petals, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a rough texture, while its stems are woody and covered in fine hairs. Guettarda erosa is adapted to salt spray and wind, making it a resilient plant in coastal environments."
