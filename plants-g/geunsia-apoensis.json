    "intro": "Geunsia apoensis, commonly known as the Apo fern, is a rare and unique plant species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in mountainous regions. Its reproductive structures are concealed within small, spore-producing capsules. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Geunsia apoensis is considered a vulnerable species."
