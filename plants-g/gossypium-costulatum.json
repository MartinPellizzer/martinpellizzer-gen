    "intro": "Gossypium costulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cotton or costleaf cotton, is a species of flowering plant in the mallow family. It is native to Central and South America, particularly found in countries like Mexico and Brazil. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, pale yellow flowers. It is cultivated for its cotton-like fibers, which are used in textile production. However, it is less commercially significant compared to other cotton species like Gossypium hirsutum."
