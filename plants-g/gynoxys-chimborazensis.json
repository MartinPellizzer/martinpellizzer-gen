    "intro": "Gynoxys chimborazensis, commonly known as the Andes beauty, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its vibrant yellow-orange flowers that bloom in dense, showy clusters. The plant is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to the harsh, cold climate of its native habitat. Due to its striking appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
