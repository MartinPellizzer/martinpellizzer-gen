    "intro": "Genista balearica, commonly known as the Balearic broom, is a flowering plant native to the Balearic Islands. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal and rocky habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. It produces small, legume-like pods that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
