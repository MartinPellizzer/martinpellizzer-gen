    "intro": "Gentiana amarella f. minima, commonly known as the dwarf gentian, is a compact, low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its compact form. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. Due to its small size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in specialty gardens."
