It is characterized by its yellowish-green flowers and hairy, glandular leaves that produce a sticky resin. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its unique morphology and chemical composition make it an important species in ecological and botanical studies. The variety adenodonta is distinguished by its smaller, more compact growth form compared to other varieties of Grindelia microcephala."
