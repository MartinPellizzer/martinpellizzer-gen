It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are usually broad and covered in a fine, moss-like coating, which helps retain moisture. Gentiana bryophylla is a perennial species, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats."
