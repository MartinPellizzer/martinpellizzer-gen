It is a perennial herb that typically grows in grasslands and rocky areas, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on slender stems. Its leaves are usually linear or lance-shaped, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss. The species is known for its ability to thrive in arid conditions, making it an important component of its native ecosystems."
