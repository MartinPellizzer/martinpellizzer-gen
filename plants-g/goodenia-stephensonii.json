    "intro": "Goodenia stephensonii, commonly known as the dwarf goodenia, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It features small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It is well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in native gardens and conservation areas."
