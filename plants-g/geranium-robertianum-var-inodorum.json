    "intro": "Geranium robertianum var. inodorum, commonly known as the scentless geranium, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing pink or red flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it prefers moist, well-drained soils in shaded to partial shade environments. Unlike its fragrant relatives, this variety lacks a strong scent, making it a subtle yet ornamental addition to gardens."
