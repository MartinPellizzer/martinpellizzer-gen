    "intro": "Grammitis lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf filmy fern, is a delicate, epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a unique structure with a central, leaf-like frond and a separate, often hidden, sporangium-bearing structure. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its intricate, lace-like appearance makes it a popular specimen in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
