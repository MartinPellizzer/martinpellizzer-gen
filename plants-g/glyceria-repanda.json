    "intro": "Glyceria repanda, commonly known as the broadleaf glyceria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, wet meadows, and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the plant is often found in association with other wetland vegetation. Glyceria repanda plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
