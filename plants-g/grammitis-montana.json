It is characterized by its delicate, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with small, clustered leaves that form dense, mat-like structures. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Grammitis montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its lush, green foliage."
