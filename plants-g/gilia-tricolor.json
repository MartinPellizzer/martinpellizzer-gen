    "intro": "Gilia tricolor, commonly known as the three-color gilia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Polemoniaceae family and is characterized by its striking, three-colored flowers that range from blue to purple to white. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its slender stems and lance-shaped leaves are adapted to arid environments, and it produces small, edible seeds that are dispersed by wind. Gilia tricolor is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens due to its vibrant, showy blooms."
