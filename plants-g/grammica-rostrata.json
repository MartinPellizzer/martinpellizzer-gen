    "intro": "Grammica rostrata, commonly known as the rostrated gramminoid, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family, Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Grammica rostrata is typically found in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and marshes. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a food source for various insects and as a stabilizer of soil in wetland environments."
