    "intro": "Galipea dasysperma, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its acoustic properties. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a glossy surface. It produces small, white flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List."
