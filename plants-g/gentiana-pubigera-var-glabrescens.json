    "intro": "Gentiana pubigera var. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous gentian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which become less prominent as the plant matures. The flowers are tubular with five lobes and are often visited by pollinators like bees and butterflies."
