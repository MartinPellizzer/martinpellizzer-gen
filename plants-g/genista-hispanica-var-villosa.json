    "intro": "Genista hispanica var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy Spanish broom, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by elongated, woody pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping or for erosion control."
