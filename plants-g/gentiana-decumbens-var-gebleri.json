    "intro": "Gentiana decumbens var. gebleri, commonly known as the Gebleri gentian, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has basal leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a hairy surface that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
