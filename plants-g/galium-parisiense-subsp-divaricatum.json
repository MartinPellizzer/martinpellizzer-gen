    "intro": "Galium parisiense subsp. divaricatum, commonly known as the creeping wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with five petals, typically arranged in clusters. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a distinctive veining pattern, while the entire plant is often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
