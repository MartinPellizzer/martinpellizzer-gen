    "intro": "Gymnadenia conopsea f. crenulata, commonly known as the crested gentian, is a rare and striking orchid species characterized by its distinctive, bell-shaped flowers. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is known for its striking blue or violet petals, which are often adorned with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous grasslands and open woodlands, preferring well-drained soils. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. The subspecies f. crenulata is distinguished by its more pronounced and rounded floral lobes compared to the typical form."
