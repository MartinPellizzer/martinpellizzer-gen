It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants such as blueberries and heathers. The plant is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and clusters of bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in spring. Gaultheria stenophylla produces small, bright red berries that are edible and have a sharp, peppery flavor. It is often found in moist, shaded forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal and medicinal properties."
