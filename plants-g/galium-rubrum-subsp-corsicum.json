It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, hairy stems that often lie prostrate on the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.
