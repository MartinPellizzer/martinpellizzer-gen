    "intro": "Ganua prolixa, commonly known as the elongated ganua, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of small, pale blue flowers that bloom during the summer months. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery fuzz, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Ganua prolixa is adapted to thrive in cool, moist conditions and is often found growing in rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
