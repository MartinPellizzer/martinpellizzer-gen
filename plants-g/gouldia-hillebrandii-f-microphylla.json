It features dense, dark green foliage with a distinctive, almost metallic sheen. The plant produces small, delicate white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. It is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal areas due to its tolerance of salty air and well-drained soils. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
