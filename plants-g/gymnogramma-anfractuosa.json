    "intro": "Gymnogramma anfractuosa, commonly known as the zigzag huperzia, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzag-shaped fronds that are typically short and stout. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including countries such as China, India, and Japan. Gymnogramma anfractuosa thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
