    "intro": "Guzmania sieffiana, commonly known as the Sieff's bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that surround its inflorescence. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports various microorganisms and small aquatic life. Its flowers, which are typically red or orange, bloom in the center of the rosette and are followed by the production of small, white, fragrant flowers. Guzmania sieffiana thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil to flourish."
