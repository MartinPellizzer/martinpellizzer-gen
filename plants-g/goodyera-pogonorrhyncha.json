It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-like arrangement of dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces a single, slender inflorescence bearing small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive beak-like spur. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in leaf litter. Goodyera pogonorrhyncha is a perennial herb that plays a role in forest ecosystems and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
