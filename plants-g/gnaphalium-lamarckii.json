    "intro": "Gnaphalium lamarckii, commonly known as the common cudweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing herbaceous perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in heads, surrounded by bracts. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Gnaphalium lamarckii is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, where it thrives in sunny to partially shaded conditions."
