    "intro": "Gnetum urens var. camporum, commonly known as the Campora gnetum, is a member of the Gnetophyta division, characterized by its unique combination of gymnosperm and angiosperm traits. It is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of Central and South America, often found in humid, shaded environments. The plant features scale-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically unisexual. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, three-lobed capsule, a feature that distinguishes it from most gymnosperms. The species is notable for its ecological role in supporting diverse insect and bird populations in its native habitat."
