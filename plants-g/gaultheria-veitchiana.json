    "intro": "Gaultheria veitchiana, commonly known as the Veitch's wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in late winter or early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. Its leaves contain aromatic compounds, giving it a mint-like scent, and it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive appearance and hardiness. Gaultheria veitchiana thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is relatively frost-tolerant, making it suitable for cooler climates."
