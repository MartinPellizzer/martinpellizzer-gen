    "intro": "Globularia amygdalifolia, commonly known as the almond-leaved globularia, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, pale green, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-white flowers in late spring, which are typically borne on short, upright stems. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
