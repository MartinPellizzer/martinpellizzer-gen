It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for landscaping in dry climates."
