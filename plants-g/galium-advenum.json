    "intro": "Galium advenum, commonly known as common bedstraw, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the summer months, followed by small, bladder-like berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, and is often found in disturbed soils. Galium advenum is noted for its creeping growth habit and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
