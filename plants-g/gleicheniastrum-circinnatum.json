    "intro": "Gleicheniastrum circinnatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in small, rounded structures called sorus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Gleicheniastrum circinnatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, fern-like appearance."
