    "intro": "Galactia grisebachii, commonly known as the gray galactia, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect growth habit, trifoliate leaves, and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, round, green pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to arid and semi-arid environments. Galactia grisebachii is often found in grasslands and rocky slopes, contributing to soil stabilization and providing nectar for pollinators."
