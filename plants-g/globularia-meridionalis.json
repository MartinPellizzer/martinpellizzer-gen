    "intro": "Globularia meridionalis, commonly known as the southern globularia, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, with small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for Mediterranean and arid climates."
