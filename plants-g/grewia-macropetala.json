    "intro": "Grewia macropetala, commonly known as the large-flowered bushwillow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne in axillary or terminal inflorescences. Its fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Grewia macropetala is often found in open woodlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
