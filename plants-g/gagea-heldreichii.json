    "intro": "Gagea heldreichii, commonly known as the Balkan spring beauty, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It features a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers in early spring. The plant belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered bulbs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
