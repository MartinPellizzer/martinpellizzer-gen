    "intro": "Gleditsia bujotii pendula, commonly known as the weeping honeylocust, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive pendulous branches that create a cascading appearance, making it a striking ornamental plant. The tree produces small, green pods that turn brown and split open to release seeds. Its compound leaves are bipinnately arranged, with small leaflets that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
