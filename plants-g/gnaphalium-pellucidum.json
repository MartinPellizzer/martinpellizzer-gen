    "intro": "Gnaphalium pellucidum, commonly known as the glassy everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense heads. The plant has a creeping or upright growth habit, with narrow, linear leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. Its flowers are typically short-lived but are known for their ability to retain color and form even after drying, making it a popular choice for floral arrangements. Gnaphalium pellucidum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas."
