    "intro": "Gomphrena helichrysoides, commonly known as the golden globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, spherical flower heads that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its foliage is gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Gomphrena helichrysoides is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
