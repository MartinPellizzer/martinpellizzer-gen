    "intro": "Galium glabrifolium, commonly known as smoothleaf bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, smooth, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its stems are often sprawling and covered with fine, soft hairs, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Galium glabrifolium is often found in the understory of forests, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various invertebrates."
