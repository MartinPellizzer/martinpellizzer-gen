    "intro": "Geonoma maxima subsp. sigmoidea, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its large, elongated, and often pinnately compound leaves. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
