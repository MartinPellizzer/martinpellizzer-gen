    "intro": "Graumuellera antarctica, commonly known as the Antarctic pearlwort, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Antarctica. It is a low-growing, mat-forming species that thrives in the extreme conditions of the continent's cold climate. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom during the short Antarctic summer. Its leaves are succulent and adapted to retain moisture in the dry, windy environment. Graumuellera antarctica plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local microorganisms."
