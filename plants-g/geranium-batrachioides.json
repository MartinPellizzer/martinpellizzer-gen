It features hairy, upright stems and heart-shaped, toothed leaves that are often tinged with purple. The plant produces small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming from late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and ornamental gardening."
