    "intro": "Galenia procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate galenia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, fleshy stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Galenia procumbens is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
