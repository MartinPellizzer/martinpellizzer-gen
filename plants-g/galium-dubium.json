    "intro": "Galium dubium, commonly known as swamp bedstraw, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features slender, ascending stems that are usually covered in fine, silky hairs. Its small, white or pale pink flowers are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, and it produces small, three-lobed berries that are dispersed by birds. Galium dubium plays a role in supporting local biodiversity by providing food and shelter for various invertebrates and birds."
