    "intro": "Gesneria pumila subsp. mimuloides, commonly known as the dwarf gesneria, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Madagascar. It features dark green, elliptical leaves that are slightly hairy on the underside, giving it a unique texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Gesneria pumila subsp. mimuloides is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and compact growth habit."
