    "intro": "Goniophlebium anisomeron, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
