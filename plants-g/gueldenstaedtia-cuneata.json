    "intro": "Gueldenstaedtia cuneata, commonly known as the narrowleaf false brome, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, woodlands, and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, upright stems that bear small, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctively narrow, pointed base. Its flowers are pale blue to violet, arranged in dense spikes, and are pollinated by insects. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
