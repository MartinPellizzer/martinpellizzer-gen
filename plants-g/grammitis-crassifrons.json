It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its distinctive, broad, leathery leaves. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered in small, cone-like structures called strobila. Grammitis crassifrons plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
