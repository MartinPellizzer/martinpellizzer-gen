    "intro": "Galactia minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, round legumes as its fruit, which contain several seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Galactia minutiflora is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
