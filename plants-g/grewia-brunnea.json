    "intro": "Grewia brunnea, commonly known as the red bushwillow, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually hairy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Grewia brunnea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
