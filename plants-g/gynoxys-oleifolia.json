    "intro": "Gynoxys oleifolia, commonly known as the Mexican oil tree, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and Central America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing oily seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, and the seeds are valued for their high oil content. Gynoxys oleifolia thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in dry forests and along riverbanks."
