    "intro": "Gnaphalium sericeum, commonly known as silverleaf cudweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous slender, silver-haired stems that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and yellow centers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in a dense layer of silky white hairs, giving the plant its distinctive appearance. Gnaphalium sericeum is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides, and it is known for its aromatic, slightly medicinal properties."
