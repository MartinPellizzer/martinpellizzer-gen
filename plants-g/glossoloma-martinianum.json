    "intro": "Glossoloma martinianum, commonly known as the Martin's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with elongated, pale green leaves and a single, showy white flower. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them, instead absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is highly sensitive to changes in its microclimate. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Glossoloma martinianum is considered a conservation concern."
