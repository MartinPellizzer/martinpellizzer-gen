It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight. Gnaphalium simii is often found in mountainous regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
