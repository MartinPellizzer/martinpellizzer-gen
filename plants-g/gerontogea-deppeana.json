    "intro": "Gerontogea deppeana, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red, typically blooming in summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Gerontogea deppeana is often found growing on rocky slopes and in crevices, demonstrating its resilience to harsh desert conditions."
