    "intro": "Grusonia marenae, commonly known as the Marenae's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Madagascar. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale greenish-white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. Grusonia marenae is notable for its specialized adaptations to its harsh, arid environment, including thick, waxy leaves that help retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species."
