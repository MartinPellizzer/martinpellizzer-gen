    "intro": "Glomera subalpina, commonly known as the alpine glomera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in high-altitude meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, and it has narrow, grass-like leaves. It is often found in alpine and subalpine ecosystems, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to climate change, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions."
