    "intro": "Galactia angustifolia var. retusa, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, and it has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Galactia angustifolia var. retusa is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a forage plant for livestock."
