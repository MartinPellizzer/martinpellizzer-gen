    "intro": "Geranium elongatum, commonly known as the slender geranium, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features upright, slender stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, covered in fine, hairy foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink or red, typically blooming from summer to autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly rough texture. Geranium elongatum is well-suited for rock gardens or as a border plant due to its upright growth habit and ornamental flowers."
