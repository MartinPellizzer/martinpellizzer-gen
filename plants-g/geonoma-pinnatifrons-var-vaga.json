    "intro": "Geonoma pinnatifrons var. vaga, commonly known as the slender-leafed geonoma, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as under the canopy of rainforests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate, while its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
