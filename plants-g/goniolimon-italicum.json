    "intro": "Goniolimon italicum, commonly known as the Italian goniolimon, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens despite its limited distribution in the wild."
