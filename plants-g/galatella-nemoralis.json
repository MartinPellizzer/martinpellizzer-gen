    "intro": "Galatella nemoralis, commonly known as the lesser twayblade, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the orchid family (Orchidaceae). It is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodland environments. It has a fibrous root system and is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
