    "intro": "Glyceria langeana, commonly known as the narrowleaf glyceria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to parts of Asia and Australia. It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, preferring moist to saturated soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Glyceria langeana is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
