    "intro": "Grammitis alepidota, commonly known as the slender grammitis, is a fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to rocky surfaces or tree trunks. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
