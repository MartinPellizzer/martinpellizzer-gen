It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, violet-blue flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and has a trailing habit, often forming mats on the ground. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. Gonolobus shortii is an important part of the local ecosystem, providing habitat and food for native insects and birds."
