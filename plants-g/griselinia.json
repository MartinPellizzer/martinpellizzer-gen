    "intro": "Griselinia, commonly known as the New Zealand glorybower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Griselinia lucida, which is native to New Zealand. These plants are evergreen shrubs or small trees, characterized by their glossy, lance-shaped leaves. They produce clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often followed by distinctive, showy seed pods. Griselinia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
