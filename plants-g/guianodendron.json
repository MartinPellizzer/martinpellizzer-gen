    "intro": "Guianodendron, commonly known as the Brazil wood tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These trees are native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela. They are characterized by their large, often heart-shaped leaves and showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The wood of some species is highly valued for its rich, reddish-brown color and has been historically used in the production of dyes and furniture. However, due to overharvesting, many species are now threatened with extinction."
