    "intro": "Gaultheria capitata var. capitata, commonly known as the red-flowered wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features dense clusters of small, elliptical leaves that are dark green and glossy on top, with a white, fuzzy underside. The plant produces striking red or pink flowers in late winter to early spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. These fruits are edible and have a sharp, spicy flavor, often used in culinary applications. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories."
