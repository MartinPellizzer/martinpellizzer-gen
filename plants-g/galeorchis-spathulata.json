    "intro": "Galeorchis spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leaf twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the southeastern United States. It is a terrestrial herb with a short, rhizomatous stem and is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring, which are typically clustered in a spike. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded woodlands. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in some regions."
