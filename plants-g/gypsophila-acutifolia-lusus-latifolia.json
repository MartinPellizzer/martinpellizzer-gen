    "intro": "Gypsophila acutifolia lusus latifolia, commonly known as the lace flower or baby's breath, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with slender stems and narrow, linear leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden borders and floral arrangements. Its botanical name reflects its sharp, pointed leaves (acutifolia) and its variant form with broader leaves (lusus latifolia)."
