    "intro": "Gemmaria pulcherrima, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively, it is considered a weed in some areas."
