    "intro": "Galatella eldarica, commonly known as the Eldarica starflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in late spring. The plant has slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly serrated edge. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
