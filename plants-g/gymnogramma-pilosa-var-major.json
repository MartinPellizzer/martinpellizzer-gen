It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. The plant features pinnately compound leaves with a dense covering of fine, hairy structures on the underside. Its fronds are typically upright, with a shield-like appearance due to the arrangement of the pinnae. The species is characterized by its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and on rocky substrates."
