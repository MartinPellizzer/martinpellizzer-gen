    "intro": "Grammitis suspensa, commonly known as the hanging fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its rhizomes while its delicate fronds cascade downward. The plant features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often divided into narrow segments, creating a feathery appearance. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Grammitis suspensa thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests."
