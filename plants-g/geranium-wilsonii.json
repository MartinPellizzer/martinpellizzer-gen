    "intro": "Geranium wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's geranium, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features upright stems with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to thrive in a variety of conditions, though it is not typically invasive."
