    "intro": "Gnaphalium leptophyllum, commonly known as the slender feather grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically forms dense mats with silvery-white, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, often producing a subtle, honey-scented aroma. Gnaphalium leptophyllum is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a common sight in dry, open habitats."
