    "intro": "Geum heterocarpum var. oligocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved avens, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are narrow and slightly heart-shaped, with a hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by distinctive, ribbed, bladder-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for ecological studies and traditional herbal medicine."
