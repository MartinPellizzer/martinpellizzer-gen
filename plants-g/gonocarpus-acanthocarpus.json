It belongs to the family Capparaceae and is characterized by its woody shrub or small tree structure. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. Its fruit is a capsule that becomes spiny when mature, aiding in seed dispersal. The leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a rough texture, contributing to its adaptability in arid environments."
