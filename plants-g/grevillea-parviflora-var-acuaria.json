It features narrow, strap-like leaves that are typically green with a reddish tinge underneath. The plant produces small, bright red flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for native landscaping."
