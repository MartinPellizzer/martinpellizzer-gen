    "intro": "Griffonia, commonly known as the African bean tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its distinctive, often branched stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. Griffonia species are also valued for their seeds, which contain high levels of 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), a compound with potential health benefits. Due to its unique botanical features and medicinal potential, Griffonia has gained attention in both traditional and modern botanical research."
