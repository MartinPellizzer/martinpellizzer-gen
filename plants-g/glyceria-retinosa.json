    "intro": "Glyceria retinosa, commonly known as narrowleaf glyceria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It typically grows in dense clumps, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wetland wildlife. Glyceria retinosa is often found in areas with standing water or saturated soil, making it a key species in aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems."
