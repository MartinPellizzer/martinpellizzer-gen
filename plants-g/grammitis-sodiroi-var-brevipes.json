    "intro": "Grammitis sodiroi var. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed rock fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its fronds are usually clustered closely together, forming a compact, low-growing structure. This variety is distinguished by its shorter stems and reduced leaf length compared to other varieties within the Grammitis genus."
