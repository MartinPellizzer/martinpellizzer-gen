    "intro": "Gothofreda capitata, commonly known as the crown-headed orchid, is a rare and unique species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth form and a single, showy floral spike that emerges from the center of the plant. The flowers are typically small, with a distinctive coloration pattern that includes shades of purple and white. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Gothofreda capitata is considered a vulnerable species."
