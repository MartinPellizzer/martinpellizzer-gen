    "intro": "Grossularia cruenta, commonly known as the blood-red mountain ash, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the rose family (Rosaceae) and is characterized by its showy, red-orange berries that contrast strikingly with its dark green leaves. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are small and white, appearing in clusters, and it produces edible fruits that are sometimes used in traditional medicine. The plant's ornamental value is notable, making it a popular choice for gardens in temperate climates."
