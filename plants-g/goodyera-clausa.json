    "intro": "Goodyera clausa, commonly known as the closed lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and a single, slender stem that produces a spike of small, white to pale green flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in pine forests and along stream banks. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption. The species is listed as endangered in some states due to habitat loss and over-collection."
