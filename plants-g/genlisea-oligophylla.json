    "intro": "Genlisea oligophylla, commonly known as the bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its small, leaf-like structures that function as traps to capture tiny aquatic organisms. The plant's unique trapping mechanism involves bladder-like organs that rapidly expel water to create a vacuum, drawing in prey. It thrives in nutrient-poor aquatic environments, where it supplements its diet with captured prey. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studying plant adaptations to nutrient-deficient habitats."
