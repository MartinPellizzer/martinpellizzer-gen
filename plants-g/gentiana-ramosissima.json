    "intro": "Gentiana ramosissima, commonly known as the blue gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are branched and somewhat woody. Gentiana ramosissima is valued in traditional medicine for its purported medicinal properties and is also a popular garden plant due to its ornamental value."
