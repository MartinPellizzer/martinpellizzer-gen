    "intro": "Gunnera makahaensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian giant shield fern, is a striking plant native to the island of Maui in Hawaii. It is characterized by its massive, shield-shaped leaves that can reach up to three meters in diameter, providing a unique visual display. The plant belongs to the family Gunneraceae, which is closely related to the cycads and consists of only a few genera. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a rough, textured surface, while the plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Gunnera makahaensis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is an important component of Hawaii's native flora."
