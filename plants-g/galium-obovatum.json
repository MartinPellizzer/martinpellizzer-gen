    "intro": "Galium obovatum, commonly known as silverweed or lesser bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features slender, often prostrate stems that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to obovate in shape, and have a slightly hairy surface. Galium obovatum is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodland floors and streambanks."
