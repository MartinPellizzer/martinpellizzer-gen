    "intro": "Gymnogramma calomelanos f. epruinata, commonly known as the powdered fern, is a fern species characterized by its unique foliage. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance that gives it a refined aesthetic. The leaves are covered in a fine, powdery coating, which contributes to its common name. This feature helps reduce water loss, making it adaptable to humid environments. It thrives in shaded, moist conditions and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
