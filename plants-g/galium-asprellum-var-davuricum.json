    "intro": "Galium asprellum var. davuricum, commonly known as the alpine bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, branched stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitats."
