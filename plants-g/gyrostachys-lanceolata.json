    "intro": "Gyrostachys lanceolata, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright, woody stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has narrow, lanceolate leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Gyrostachys lanceolata is adapted to thrive in poor soils and can survive extreme temperature fluctuations."
