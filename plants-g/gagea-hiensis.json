    "intro": "Gagea hiensis, commonly known as the Chinese spring beauty, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern China. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest floors and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers in early spring. Its bulbs are adapted for storage and are an important part of its survival strategy in its native habitat. Gagea hiensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and early blooming habit."
