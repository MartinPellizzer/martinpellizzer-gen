    "intro": "Geonoma pleioneura, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its rhizome is creeping, and it produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves. The foliage is dense and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to tropical gardens."
