    "intro": "Goodyera ruttenii, commonly known as the Rutten's moss orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its small, intricate leaves and inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Goodyera ruttenii is considered endangered and is often protected in conservation programs."
