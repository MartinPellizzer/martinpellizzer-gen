    "intro": "Gentiana confertifolia, commonly known as the clustered gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant features a robust root system and produces clusters of leaves that are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette. Its flowers are tubular with five lobes and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Gentiana confertifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats."
