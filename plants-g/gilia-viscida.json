    "intro": "Gilia viscida, commonly known as sticky gilia, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a sticky texture. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, typically blooming from spring to early summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Gilia viscida is adapted to withstand drought conditions and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
