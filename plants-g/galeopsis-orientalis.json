    "intro": "Galeopsis orientalis, commonly known as the oriental horseweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in whorled clusters, which bloom from June to August. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, two-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Galeopsis orientalis is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in dry meadows, where it thrives in full sun."
