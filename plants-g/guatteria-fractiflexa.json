    "intro": "Guatteria fractiflexa, commonly known as the flexible guatteria, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in humid lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are typically elliptical and have a smooth, waxy surface. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in axillary inflorescences, and it produces dark blue to black berries as fruit. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a relatively rare and understudied species within its native range."
