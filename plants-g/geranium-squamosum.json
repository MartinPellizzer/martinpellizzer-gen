    "intro": "Geranium squamosum, commonly known as the sand geranium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it an ideal plant for low-maintenance landscaping."
