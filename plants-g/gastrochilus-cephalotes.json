    "intro": "Gastrochilus cephalotes, commonly known as the helmet orchid, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, helmet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in tropical rainforests. Its leaves are long and narrow, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The flowers are usually greenish-yellow with a distinct, rounded lip that resembles a helmet, giving the plant its common name."
