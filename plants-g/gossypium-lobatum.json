    "intro": "Gossypium lobatum, commonly known as the woolly cotton or desert cotton, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by capsules containing fluffy, white seeds. Gossypium lobatum is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes other cotton species and hibiscus plants. Its fibrous seeds are adapted for wind dispersal, allowing the plant to propagate in disturbed and dry soils."
