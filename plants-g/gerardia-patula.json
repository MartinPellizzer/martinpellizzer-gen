It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. It features slender, branching stems and small, daisy-like flowers with yellow disc florets. Gerardia patula is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local pollinator populations."
