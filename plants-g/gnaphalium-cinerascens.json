It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its leaves are silver-gray due to a dense covering of fine hairs, and the flowers are small and inconspicuous, often appearing in clusters. It is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
