    "intro": "Goniopteris subtetragona, commonly known as the four-angled fern, is a fossil plant belonging to the family Osmundaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, four-angled fronds that are typically preserved as compressions in Paleozoic rock formations. The plant exhibits a complex vascular system, indicating advanced evolutionary adaptations for water transport and structural support. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with a unique arrangement of pinnae that suggests a specialized growth habit. Goniopteris subtetragona provides important insights into the morphology and ecology of early land plants during the Carboniferous period."
