    "intro": "Genlisea subviridis, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is native to South America and thrives in shallow, nutrient-rich waters. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms for nutrition. These bladders are highly specialized and function as passive traps, closing rapidly when stimulated by movement. Genlisea subviridis is often cultivated in aquariums due to its unique appearance and ecological role in aquatic ecosystems."
