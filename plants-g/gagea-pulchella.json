    "intro": "Gagea pulchella, commonly known as the showy gagea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or open areas. Its bulbs are small and often covered in a tunic-like outer layer, which helps protect them during dormancy. Gagea pulchella is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in wildflower gardens and natural habitats."
