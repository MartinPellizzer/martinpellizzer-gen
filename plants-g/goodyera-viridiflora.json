    "intro": "Goodyera viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and its striking, greenish-white flowers that bloom in a dense, three-ridged spike. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodland habitats, often on the forest floor or in rock crevices. Its flowers are pollinated by bees and other insects, and it forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Goodyera viridiflora is an ephemeral plant, with a short growing season and a lifecycle that is closely tied to the seasonal changes of its environment."
