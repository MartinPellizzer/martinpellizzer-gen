    "intro": "Gomphia pinetorum, commonly known as the pinegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas, particularly near pine trees. Its growth habit is low to the ground, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Gomphia pinetorum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
