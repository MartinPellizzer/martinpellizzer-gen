    "intro": "Gossypium punctatum, commonly known as the prickly cotton or wild cotton, is a species of flowering plant in the mallow family. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its hairy, spiny stems and leaves, as well as its small, pale yellow flowers. Its cotton-like fibers are produced in the seed pods, which are covered in fine, prickly hairs. Gossypium punctatum is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
