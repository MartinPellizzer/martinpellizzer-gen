    "intro": "Geissanthus vanderwerffii, commonly known as Vanderwerff's geissanthus, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and gourds, though it is not closely related to them. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. It thrives in cool, high-altitude environments and is adapted to the specific ecological conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
