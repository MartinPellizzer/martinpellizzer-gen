It is characterized by its evergreen foliage and produces bright red, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. The plant has small, white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by the development of its distinctive, spiny fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and rocky garden environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
