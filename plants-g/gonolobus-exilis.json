    "intro": "Gonolobus exilis, commonly known as the slender gonolobus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Leguminosae, also known as the Fabaceae family, which includes many plants that form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. The plant is characterized by its delicate, climbing habit and small, pea-like flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, elongated pods that contain its seeds. Gonolobus exilis is often found in disturbed habitats and is adapted to thrive in moist, tropical environments."
