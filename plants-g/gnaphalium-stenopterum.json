    "intro": "Gnaphalium stenopterum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cudweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, hairy, gray-green leaves that are narrow and pointed. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers during the summer months, which are borne on slender, hairy stalks. It is often found in moist meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Its aromatic leaves and flowers make it a characteristic component of wetland and grassland ecosystems."
