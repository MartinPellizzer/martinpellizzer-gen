    "intro": "Galium linczevskyi, commonly known as the Linczevsky's bedstraw, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
