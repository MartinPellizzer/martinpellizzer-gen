It consists of a single species, Gymnopoma cleistogama, native to southern Africa. The plant is characterized by its small, woody shrub form and produces yellow or green flowers. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and it has a deep root system adapted to arid environments. The wood of Gymnopoma is highly valued for its aromatic properties and is used in traditional crafts and medicine."
