    "intro": "Gymnocalycium miltii, commonly known as the Moon Cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its swollen, globular stem and vibrant, colorful flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is typically found in arid and semi-arid environments, where it thrives in well-drained soil. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, drought-prone conditions. Gymnocalycium miltii is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its striking appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
