    "intro": "Gnaphalium pterigoideum, commonly known as the common cudweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is a low-growing herbaceous plant that typically thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. The plant features small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by pale green bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its fuzzy appearance. Gnaphalium pterigoideum is known for its ability to produce a sticky, resinous substance that can be used in traditional medicine."
