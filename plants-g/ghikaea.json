    "intro": "Ghikaea, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant has hairy, gray-green foliage that helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its yellow flowers bloom in the spring and are followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Ghikaea is adapted to thrive in poor soils and is often found in disturbed or rocky habitats."
