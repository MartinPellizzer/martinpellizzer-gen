    "intro": "Geranium wislizeni, commonly known as the pink geranium, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features upright stems with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a slightly succulent texture. The plant produces clusters of showy, pink to magenta flowers with five petals, which bloom from spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
