    "intro": "Galium gracilens var. rotundifolium, commonly known as roundleaf bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are rounded at the tips. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its delicate appearance and ability to form dense mats make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
