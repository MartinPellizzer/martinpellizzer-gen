    "intro": "Galium miltorrhizum var. molle, commonly known as Chinese nettle or mile-a-minute weed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit, with opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually hairy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, and its roots are known for their medicinal properties. It is native to East Asia but has become an invasive species in many parts of the world. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it a challenging weed to control."
