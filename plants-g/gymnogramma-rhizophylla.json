    "intro": "Gymnogramma rhizophylla, commonly known as the creeping spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or on rocky surfaces. Gymnogramma rhizophylla has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a feature typical of many fern species."
