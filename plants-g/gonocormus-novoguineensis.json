It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and has a climbing habit, often found in humid, shaded forest environments. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a velvety texture, while the fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. The botanical features of Gonocormus novoguineensis make it a unique and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
