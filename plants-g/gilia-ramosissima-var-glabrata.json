    "intro": "Gilia ramosissima var. glabrata, commonly known as the plains gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, though the variety glabrata is distinguished by its smoother, hairless foliage. The species is adapted to arid conditions and is often found in areas with well-drained soils."
