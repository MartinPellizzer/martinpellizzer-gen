    "intro": "Galipea simplicifolia, commonly known as the white cedar, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and glossy on top. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by elongated, woody fruits containing seeds. Galipea simplicifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as along riverbanks and in humid forests. Its slow growth and dense foliage make it a valuable species for ornamental and ecological purposes."
