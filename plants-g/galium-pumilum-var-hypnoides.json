    "intro": "Galium pumilum var. hypnoides, commonly known as the dwarf bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It features small, opposite leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowering stems are often prostrate or sprawling, contributing to its dense, carpet-like growth habit."
