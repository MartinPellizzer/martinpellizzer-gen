It is characterized by its distinctive, woody, spherical stem that resembles a small tree or shrub. The plant produces small, scale-like leaves and has a specialized reproductive structure known as a gymnosperm-like cone. It is typically found in specific habitats with high humidity and well-drained soils, often in tropical or subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
