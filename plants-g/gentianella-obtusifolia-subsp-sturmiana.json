    "intro": "Gentianella obtusifolia subsp. sturmiana, commonly known as Sturm's gentian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are generally basal, lanceolate, and covered with a fine pubescence. The subspecies is distinguished by its shorter, more robust stems and slightly broader leaves compared to the typical form of Gentianella obtusifolia."
