    "intro": "Gnaphalium uliginosum var. nudum, commonly known as the naked willow herb, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in moist soils, often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are usually slender and slightly hairy. The variety *nudum* is distinguished by its reduced or absent bracts, giving it a more delicate appearance compared to other varieties of the species."
