    "intro": "Grewia carrissoi, commonly known as the red gum tree, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-bark that peels in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by spherical, red fruits that are edible for some animals but generally unpalatable to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions with a Mediterranean climate. Grewia carrissoi plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
