    "intro": "Genista elata, commonly known as the creeping yellowflower broom, is a perennial shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and have a slightly hairy texture. Genista elata is adapted to poor, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas."
