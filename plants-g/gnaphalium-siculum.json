The plant typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 centimeters and features small, white to pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Gnaphalium siculum is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
