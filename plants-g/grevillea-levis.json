    "intro": "Grevillea levis, commonly known as the coastal grevillea, is a shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically grey-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces striking, feather-like inflorescences that range in color from yellow to orange, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and Mediterranean climates. Grevillea levis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native gardens."
