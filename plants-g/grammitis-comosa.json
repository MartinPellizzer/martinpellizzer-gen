    "intro": "Grammitis comosa, commonly known as the hairy fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, wiry stems and small, clustered fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are usually lance-shaped and have a soft, velvety texture. Grammitis comosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
