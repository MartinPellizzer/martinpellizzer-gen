    "intro": "Girardinia zeylanica, commonly known as the Ceylon sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to Sri Lanka. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood that has been historically valued for its use in incense and perfumes. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth texture. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species."
