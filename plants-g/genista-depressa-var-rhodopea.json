    "intro": "Genista depressa var. rhodopea, commonly known as the Rhodope shrub or Rhodope genista, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southeastern Europe. It features dense, sprawling growth with small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in Mediterranean climates."
