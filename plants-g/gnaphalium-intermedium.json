    "intro": "Gnaphalium intermedium, commonly known as the common cudweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a low-growing herbaceous perennial that typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are clustered in dense, spherical formations called capitula. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Gnaphalium intermedium is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils, and it is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
