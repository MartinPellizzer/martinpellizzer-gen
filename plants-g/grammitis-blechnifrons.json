    "intro": "Grammitis blechnifrons, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hartiara, is a fern native to the tropical regions of South and Central America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which helps it anchor in the soil. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns."
