    "intro": "Griffinia rochae, commonly known as the Rocha's griffinia, is a rare and unique plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble the wings of a griffin, hence its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Griffinia rochae is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
