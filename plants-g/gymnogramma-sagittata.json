    "intro": "Gymnogramma sagittata, commonly known as the arrowhead fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a common feature in ferns. Gymnogramma sagittata thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
