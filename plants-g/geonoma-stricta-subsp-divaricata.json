    "intro": "Geonoma stricta subsp. divaricata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed geonoma, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in forest understories. The plant is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and narrow, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered near the base of the plant. This species is adapted to low-light conditions and plays a role in providing habitat for various small organisms in its native ecosystem."
