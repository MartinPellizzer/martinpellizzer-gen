It comprises several species, most notably *Goyazia umbellata*, which is native to South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its evergreen shrub or small tree form, with opposite, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, often white or pale pink, and it produces small, round berries. Goyazia is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
